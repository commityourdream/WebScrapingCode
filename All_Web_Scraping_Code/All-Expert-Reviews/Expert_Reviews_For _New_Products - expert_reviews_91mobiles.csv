1720,30,29053,,,2016-10-17,,29053,Ershad Kaleebullah -,Apple iPhone 7 Plus camera review: the best implementation of dual cameras on a smartphone yet,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/apple-iphone-7-plus-camera-review?pid=29053," “The iPhone 7 Plus pièce de résistance is its dual camera but how good is it really?” In 2014, after looking at the market realities, Apple finally succumbed and introduced a larger iPhone – the iPhone 6 Plus – to cater to a larger demographic of smartphone users who loved using phablets.  Obviously, the late CEO Steve Jobs would have scoffed at this idea from the start. However, apart from the bigger screen and better battery life, the iPhone 6 Plus distinguished itself from the iPhone 6 (review) by offering optical image stabilisation in its camera. The same continued with last year’s iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus (review). However, this distinction wasn’t enough to warrant a sale. This year though, Apple has pulled out all the stops: the iPhone 7 Plus (first impressions) comes with a dual camera and some fun new features. We captured a few images in different lighting conditions to test the new camera. Let’s find out how it fares. Before we analyse the quality of images, let’s take a look at the specifications. The iPhone 7 Plus comes with two 12MP cameras. The primary 12MP shooter uses a six-element lens and a Sony sensor with a 56mm lens and an f/1.8 aperture. The secondary camera is another 12MP shooter that has a 28mm lens and a slower f/2.8 aperture. What this essentially means is that using the 28mm lens on the second camera, the phone can simulate optical zoom, i.e. you can zoom 2x into the subject. In fact, Apple calls the primary 12MP camera a wide-angle one and the secondary one telephoto – which is definitely a bit of a stretch but we’ll take it. Note that the optical image stabilisation is limited to the main 12MP lens with f/1.8 aperture. The camera app itself is still pretty much the same from before with an emphasis on easy shooting than manual controls (you can download a third-party app like ProCam 4 if you want a professional mode). However, a new Portrait mode – which can create a nice Depth-of-Field or Bokeh effect using software algorithms – is expected to reach the iPhone 7 Plus by December via a software update. But don’t worry, we had a look at the beta version of the Portrait mode in iOS 10.1.  The most important new addition to the iPhone 7 Plus is its new telephoto camera. Essentially, at 28mm you get a lot less frame but the second camera can conjure up more depth in the background than the primary one; by default, you get a better background blur. For example, take a look at the picture below of the red flowers with the stones in the background. The background defocus is a little more prominent in the zoomed in shot. The 2x optical zoom is definitely the pièce de résistance on the iPhone 7 Plus. You also get 10x digital zoom that manages to throw up more impressive results than other phones with digital zoom, which is an added advantage.   Even before we start talking about the Portrait mode allow us to reiterate that this is the beta version and the final version could be entirely overhauled for all we know. Having said that, even in this state, the Portrait mode is super impressive. We shot this colleague inside our office and if you look closely you will notice that hair strands of our subject are missing, which indicates that the software does an aggressive job of clipping unwanted information. Moreover, the noise levels are much higher than shots taken using the regular mode.   Moving on to our standard tests, in this long shot of the area around our office with thick foliage in the foreground and some buildings in the background. If you look at the sample image closely, you will notice that the definition in the leaves is more evident at the left edge and as you move your vision across the image, the leave start merging into each other. The iPhone 7 Plus’ camera does handle the shadows really well and manages to keep the colour in check. The colour of the blue sky is also very even with no evidence of blowing up the highlights. In fact, the overall colour is pretty accurate too. The muted saturation levels might feel slightly dull for some but we prefer it this way. What’s impressive is that the barrel distortion is also in check and, at least for the areas that are in focus, the iPhone doesn’t lose any definition at the edges.  We shot a yellow flower and here we’ve inspect the entire frame. We noticed that the background has a pinkish hue that looks quite distracting. Furthermore, there is a bit of lens distortion at the edges as well. The colours, however, are once again close to natural and look pleasing to the eye as well.  In a closer crop of the image, we can clearly notice the iPhone 7’s 12MP camera has managed to capture even the minute details like the slightly cut corners of the green leaf. The details look very impressive when you look at it standalone but we happened to compare it with a similar shot taken by the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge (review) – arguably the best camera on an Android phone – and noticed that the details were a bit more pronounced. We attribute it to the presence of a bigger 1/2.5-inch sensor compared to the 1/3-inch one on the iPhone 7 Plus.  To test the High Dynamic range (HDR) mode in the iPhone 7 Plus, we decided to shoot our office building against the light of the setting sun. The phone also saves a copy of the regular shot and you can clearly see that the halo of the yellow sun bleeds into the evening sky. Moreover, a lot of details are lost in the blown out highlights.  With HDR on, the camera takes three photos in three different exposures to use the image information and create one composite image. This composite image has infinitely better contrast and controls the bloom from the sun much better. Also, you will notice that the software algorithm has done a pretty good job of recovering details from the shadows in the trees. Also, thanks to the powerful A10 Fusion chip HDR processing happens almost instantly making us use the mode more often than we have in other phones. Once again we decided to use our swanky new office campus as the subject. Here the building stands tall against the night sky and only a few rooms are lit, which gives us a nice contrast setting to check if the iPhone 7 Plus camera can actually hold up. And we are glad to inform that the iPhone 7 Plus’ low light performance has improved by quite a margin compared to its predecessor. The camera software uses ISO125 and a 1/4 shutter stop. We think that is a smart combination of settings to ensure that the camera captures the best post possible shot in the given light condition. There is definitely a good amount of noise but there is very little compromise on the details. This is a really good image, and if you have a bit of patience and steady hands you can definitely achieve some decent shots in low light conditions with the iPhone 7 Plus.  The resolution of the front camera has been amped up to 7MP from 5MP. This jump in resolution evidently results in a better shot overall but unfortunately the iPhone 7 Plus tends to concentrate on the subject more than the background as a result of which a lot of details are lost in the process.  Having said that, lovers of self portraits are still bound to be more than satisfied by the performance of the front camera. In any case, most of these images are going to end up on social networking websites.  The iPhone 7 Plus is capable of shooting videos in 4K at 30fps. These videos are rich with detail and thanks to the in-built optical image stabilisation (OIS) the video footage that we shot was pretty stable too. The only problem with the iPhone 7 Plus is that it still captures the audio in mono. This is honestly a travesty in this day and age where even phones half (sometimes less than half) the price of the iPhone 7 Plus can do stereo recording.  Ever since Apple introduced slow motion video recording at 720p resolution and 240fps with the iPhone 6, it has sort of become the gold standard for slow motion videos on a phone. And that fact doesn’t change with the iPhone 7 Plus either. We still get comparably great footage and in the right light the results are really impressive – at least for a phone. Take a look at the footage below for your own perusal.  Dual cameras on a smartphone are nothing new. However, Apple takes it up a notch by —  dare we say it once again — making it better and quite possibly the best yet. Currently, the Huawei P9 and the LG G5 are the most recognisable smartphones from the Android fraternity to sport dual cameras. Huawei’s implementation uses the secondary camera uses a monochrome sensor to capture more details and light, in general, whereas the LG G5 uses the secondary camera to capture a wider area of view. However, the iPhone 7 Plus’ with its optical zoom and Portrait mode (for added depth) actually produces more interesting and usable results when compared directly with the Huawei P9 (review) or the LG G5 (review).(Related read: Apple iPhone 7 Plus and Samsung Galaxy S7 camera comparison: the best shooter around?) Granted, the pictures captured by the iPhone 7 Plus may not be as good as the Samsung Galaxy S7’s — which we incidentally proved in our direct comparison — but we still think that Apple has that one trick up its sleeve to actually make us sit up and take notice. This is, quite honestly, some ingenious engineering at work. "
1721,30,29780,4,5,2017-10-27,,29780,Ketaki Bhojnagarwala -,Apple iPhone 8 review: the go-to choice,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/apple-iphone-8-review?pid=29780," Apple might have decided to skip on its ‘s’ naming convention this year, but that wasn’t because the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus (first impressions) are a big jump over the 7 and 7 Plus (review). That was left to the iPhone X, which is Apple’s most revolutionary iPhone yet. The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus instead bring incremental updates over last year’s iPhones, along with minor upgrades to design. The iPhone 8 is the most affordable of 2017’s lineup, and is likely to be the go-to choice for buyers in price conscious markets like India. I’ve been using the device as my primary driver for the last two weeks, and here’s the lowdown.The iPhone 8 is the least exciting device in this year’s iPhone lineup, but for the ‘base’ iPhone of the lot, it’s still a powerful smartphone. It gets the same A11 Bionic chipset as the 8 Plus and X, and dons the new design with a glass back panel and wireless charging capabilities. For users who own anything older than an iPhone 7, the iPhone 8 is a solid upgrade, and one that should tide you through the next couple of years. One of the biggest disappointments with the iPhone 8 is the unchanged design. From the front, it’s virtually impossible to distinguish it from the iPhone 6 that was launched back in 2014. After using a slew of bezel-less smartphones this year, the iPhone 8 feels decidedly dated with its chunky bezels on the top and bottom. There are some changes to the rear panel though ­– instead of aluminium, Apple has opted for a glass back – reminiscent of the iPhone 4/4s. This is primarily to enable wireless charging, which is a new feature for iPhones. Of course, you’ll need to purchase a wireless charger separately to use the feature. While the design is nothing to wax eloquent about, the iPhone 8 does feel more solid in the hand compared to the 7. But the slippery back panel warrants a case, especially because you don’t want to risk cracking the glass (even though Apple claims it’s the strongest glass ever used on a smartphone). The iPhone 8 comes in three colours ­– silver, black and a new gold hue which is surprisingly elegant. And before you ask, there’s still no headphone jack, so don’t forget to carry the Lightning earpods with you. Apple continues to bundle a 3.5mm to Lightning adapter in the box, in case you want to use your old headphonesThe iPhone 8 runs iOS 11 out of the box, and there are quite a few new features on board. There’s a redesigned Control Center which I personally love, the ability to edit and annotate screenshots, the new Files app and an all-new App Store.Related read: How iOS 11 will help you save up to 50% space on your iPhone and iPad The new iPhones are powered by Apple’s A11 Bionic processor, a hexa-core chipset consisting of four high-efficiency cores and two high-performance cores. This is the same chipset that also powers the iPhone X, so you’re not missing out on anything on the performance front. The iPhone 8 gets 2GB of RAM to work with, compared to the 8 Plus’ 3GB. Apple finally got rid of the 32GB base variant this year, so the new iPhones come in 64GB and 256GB options, which are far more practical.  In day to day usage, you’d be hard-pressed to find a difference coming from the 7, but the A11 Bionic does enable the new iPhones to support augmented reality apps. The number of AR apps and games in the App Store are limited at the moment, but the ones I tried, including IKEA’s catalogue app that lets you place 3D furniture in your home, and Zombie Gunship Revenant AR, work really well. The battery life on the iPhone 8 is disappointing, as expected. It barely lasted a day with heavy usage, but might survive until bed time if you’re a light user. Either way, you’d want to have a powerbank on you for emergencies. Apart from wireless charging, the iPhone 8 also supports fast charging, but as expected, you won’t find a fast charger in the box. For the best fast charging experience you can use a MacBook’s 29W USB Type-C adapter, although plugging in an iPad charger will also juice up your iPhone faster.  In terms of connectivity, the switch from metal to glass means the iPhone 8 doesn’t need antenna bands, but in my personal experience, I found 4G connectivity to be poor, at least on my Airtel SIM. There were several instances where I found mobile data just wouldn’t work, despite having full signal strength.  Apart from this, it’s worth mentioning that the 2017 iPhones are the first to support Bluetooth 5.0, which apart from better range and transfer speeds, also lets you connect two wireless devices simultaneously.  If you own an iPhone 7, there’s absolutely no need to upgrade this year, but if you’re using an older-generation iPhone, such as the 6 or 6s, you’ll definitely notice the difference with the 8. While there are plenty of excellent Android options available, including the Galaxy S8, Pixel 2 (first impressions) and OnePlus 5 (review), the reason many users prefer to stick with iPhones is because they continue to work well after two to three years. I have an iPhone 6 which is still very usable, although it’s no longer my primary smartphone. The bottomline? The iPhone 8 isn’t a revolutionary device in terms of design, but it’s still one of the best flagships in the market. Personally, I’d choose the 8 Plus because of the dual cameras and bigger battery, but for many users, the 8 will be a more pocket-friendly option… in more ways than one."
2272,30,33000,,,2018-10-23,,33000,Nitansh Rastogi -,Apple iPhone XR review: the ‘R’ight iPhone for most out there,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/apple-iphone-xr-review?pid=33000," Last year, for the first time ever, Apple unveiled three new iPhones simultaneously – the iPhone 8 (review), iPhone 8 Plus (review) and iPhone X (review). While the first two were successors to the iPhone 7 duo (review), the iPhone X was a true-blue flagship with a futuristic design that marked several firsts for Apple. Fast forward to 2018, and the company has flipped this strategy to launch two successors to the iPhone X in the form of the iPhone XS (review) and XS Max, along with the iPhone XR, which is the most affordable offering among the trio. But with the spotlight on its pricier siblings, does the iPhone XR pack in enough to stand on its own? Is there more to it than just the (relative) “affordability” factor? I try to answer these burning questions among others in this review.
If the Apple iPhone XS and XS Max come across as the more serious members of the family, the iPhone XR seems like the younger sibling that just wants to have fun. You’ll know what I’m talking about when you see the multitude of bright hues the iPhone XR comes in. While my review unit was black, you can opt for coral, orange, white and yellow colourways along with the iconic (PRODUCT) RED. These colours stand out in a sea of similar-looking handsets, and can possibly find many takers in the same vein as the iPhone 5C. Furthermore, the iPhone XR continues to offer a glass-back design which looks and feels premium, though the panel attracts fingerprints and smudges. Thankfully, the aluminium sides offer a robust feel and the phone offers an IP67 rating against dust and water (the iPhone XS and XS Max offer better IP68 certification).
 While many would consider the iPhone XR a poor sibling to the iPhone XS duo, the Cupertino-based company has made sure that’s not really the case. Unlike last year where only the iPhone X featured a notch-bearing display, this time around, all three models feature cut-outs atop their screens. This means you’ll get a high screen-to-body ratio, which is important as the XR sports a large 6.1-inch display. Unless you have small hands, you should have no problems reaching the corners of the screen. Of course, you can also use the Reachability feature to bring the working area of the screen to the lower half (in case your digits aren’t able to access the top portion). 
Having said that, if you compare the Apple iPhone XR to last year’s iPhone X or the newly-launched iPhone XS and XS Max, you’ll notice that the bezels around the screen aren’t as slim. Even though this shouldn’t be a problem, it sticks out like a sore thumb, especially once you’ve noticed this.  One of the biggest problems with affordable versions of flagship smartphones is that they compromise on hardware. That’s not the case with the iPhone XR, as the handset ships with the powerful 7nm Bionic A12 SoC, the same chip utilised by the XS and the XS Max. The chip is said to offer 15 percent faster CPU performance while consuming 50 percent less power, and that shows in real-life performance too. At one point in time, I had as many as 40 apps open (though so many apps aren’t kept in memory) and the device didn’t show any instance of lag. AnTuTu results also put the iPhone XR ahead of Android flagships, much like its brothers. Add to it the fact that the chip packs in the next-gen Neural Engine, and the handset opens an entire world of possibilities. 
With such powerful internals and 50 percent faster GPU, gaming on the Apple iPhone XR is also an enjoyable affair. Racing in Asphalt 9 or playing Fortnite for long hours is fun, and the bigger display helps too.   
If you are wondering what differentiates the iPhone XR from the XS and XS Max, you just need to flip the handset. Instead of dual cameras on the rear, the iPhone XR ships with a single shooter at the back. However, the 12-megapixel f/1.8 snapper is the same as the primary shooter on its siblings, which ensures that image quality is still top notch. Add to it features like Smart HDR, and the phone offers impressive photos, albeit oversaturated ones (something which Samsung does a slightly better job of). In terms of videos, you get the ability to capture up to 4k videos at 60fps as well as slow-mo clips at 240fps. Along with stereo speakers, the handset can record stereo sound as well thanks to four built-in mics. 
Instead of boring you with details, here’s a look at the camera samples shot using the iPhone XR.
If you think the iPhone XR misses out with its single camera, think again. While the smartphone doesn’t offer 2x optical zoom, it does support Portrait mode. However, the key difference is that Apple has trained its Machine Learning algorithm to only work with people and not objects. Another factor worth noting here is that since the smartphone lacks the secondary shooter to calculate depth, you’ll need to get quite close to the person to capture a portrait photo (though the use of the secondary sensor means the end result has a crop factor, so the XR seems to capture a wider frame in portrait mode). Quality-wise, the single shooter is able to pull off the depth-of-field effect fairly well, with proper edge separation between the subject and background, although it’s not as perfect as iPhone XS Max. The good thing however, is the fact that you also get Studio Light and Contour Light (there’re no Stage Light and Stage Light modes, unlike its siblings) along with the ability to control the amount of blur post shooting. Plus, since the iPhone XR uses its f/1.8 camera to capture portrait shots, the results are less grainy in low light than those on the XS and XS Max, which use the secondary f/2.2 telephoto lens for this purpose.                
For selfies, the iPhone XR ships with a 7MP sensor, just like its siblings. This means, you get all the usual goodies, including portrait mode as well as the newly-introduced depth control feature. The selfies offer a high level of detail with good colour output. Of course, the front snapper also enables Face ID, which works quite well as it makes use of Apple’s Neural Engine.   As mentioned in our iPhone XS Max review, the latest build of iOS brings several interesting capabilities. From getting better control over notifications (something that was needed on iOS for a long time) to seeing how addicted you are to the phone with the Screen Time feature, there’s a lot to like about the operating system. However, for me, the most interesting addition is Siri Shortcuts, which is similar to Macros on Microsoft Excel — letting you trigger a certain set of actions with a single command. Taking that a step further is the dedicated Shortcuts app (this needs to be downloaded from the App Store), which allows you to create your own chain of actions or choose the ones you want from the provided gallery. Every morning for example, you can set up a shortcut to get the phone to read you your appointments, and then play podcasts or a particular playlist for your morning run.   
Even though I’m a power user, with my usage comprising calls, messaging, listening to podcasts, watching videos off YouTube and Netflix, using GPS, all while staying connected via Bluetooth to my Apple Watch Series 3 and Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones, the phone manages to offer good battery life. It might be due to its lower-res 720p screen, but I got around five hours of screen-on time, which is at par with most flagships. All said and done, you won’t need to scout around for the charger until the end of the day.   
A key differentiator between the iPhone XS twins and the XR is that the latter features an LCD display instead of the OLED panels found on the former. The XR’s display bears HD resolution instead of full HD. You should also know that the iPhone XR misses out on 3D Touch, but Apple has replaced this feature with a nice haptic feedback when you long press certain areas. The TrueTone display does come with support for wide colour gamut, and offers 120Hz touch sensing. While the use of an LCD screen does mean that blacks aren’t as black, the resolution shouldn’t be a cause of concern. For reference, the iPhone 8 duo also ship with the same screen resolution, and with a pixel density of 328ppi, the XR fits into Apple’s description of Retina Display, which means that human eyes can’t discern individual pixels on this phone. Dubbed as the Liquid Retina Display, the 6.1-inch panel on the iPhone XR offers crisp visuals. The screen is immensely bright, and can be used outdoors and offers good viewing angles too.  
While Apple’s iPhone XR offers good battery life, it doesn’t come bundled with a fast charger. This means, with the standard 1A adapter, the iPhone XR takes a long time to charge to 100 percent. The phone does support wireless charging though. 
If you have a wide variety of standard earphones with a 3.5mm jack, you’re in for a disappointment with the latest iPhones. Acting as a double whammy (first one was the removal of the headphone socket), the Cupertino brand doesn’t even ship the 3.5mm adapter in the retail box.  
While I really commend Apple for offering a portrait mode with a single shooter, the fact that dual cameras are now available on the most basic of phones makes it difficult to digest the fact that you can’t get optical zoom on the iPhone XR. Don’t get me wrong, the camera on the newest member in the iPhone family is quite capable, but optical zoom is definitely a handy feature to have. Add to it the fact that Google is able to offer optical zoom-like capability (via the Super Res Zoom feature) with just a single rear camera on the new Pixel 3 duo, it makes one question why Apple can’t use its Neural Network and imaging prowess to offer something similar. 
It’s been a while since I came across a smartphone that heats up after intensive use. That’s not the case with the iPhone XR however, as it gets quite warm even when used for shooting images or doing multiple tasks for longer sessions. Needless to say, the device also heats up when used for 30 minute gaming sessions. While it shouldn’t be an issue if you’re using the phone in an airconditioned environment indoors, it might be a cause of concern when you’re out and about. 
The iPhone XR is a peculiar smartphone. While its pricier siblings offer coveted features like dual cameras, the XR doesn’t and yet, its starting price of Rs 76,990 puts it in the same territory as other Android flagships. This means that the handset is up against some solid rivals.  
There’s a reason why Apple discontinued the iPhone X in the US… and that’s evident when you see that the device betters the iPhone XR in several aspects. But in India, the iPhone X is still available to buy, and when you take into account the various festive offers, then you should be able to snag one for as little as Rs 60,000, making it a steal deal in comparison to the iPhone XR. While the iPhone XR does ship with a newer processor, the iPhone X offers dual cameras with optical zoom and a better display. Moreover, the iPhone X looks about the same as the new XS, so if you like to flaunt, you could fool others into thinking you have the latest one. 
With top-end specs, a gorgeous display, stunning design, a beefy 4,000mAh battery and of course, the S Pen, the Chaebol’s high-end offering is the phone to beat. The Note9 (review) is also priced lower than the iPhone XR, making it a better all-round package, especially for power users. 
The smaller sibling of the third-gen Pixel duo is also priced lower than the iPhone XR. If you’re looking for a compact smartphone, the Pixel 3 (review) is a good candidate and is easily the best camera phone available on the market. Along with its powerful internals and slew of software goodies, the device promises a clean software experience. 
Considering you can get many capable flagships in Android territory in the same price segment as the iPhone XR, it’d be wrong to look at Apple’s offering with the same lens. However, if you consider the current lineup of iPhones, the base model of the XR costs almost 25 percent less than the iPhone XR – and therein lies the charm. Choosing between the iPhone XR and one of the flagship Android phones is mostly about making a choice of platform, so that’s totally up to you. If you already own other Apple devices or want to get into the “walled garden”, and are wondering if the iPhone XR is the ‘R’ight choice for you, here’s what I recommend:  
All said and done, apart from the difference in camera capabilities, Apple’s iPhone XR is perhaps the best iPhone launched this year. The best part is that Apple hasn’t treated the XR as a third wheel, and you get the same SoC and all the new features, including dual-SIM capabilities. This makes me believe that the smartphone will sell like hot cakes. Do pick one of the funky colour options though, if you’re swiping your plastic…

2272,30,32952,,,2018-10-19,,32952,Ketaki Bhojnagarwala -,Apple iPhone XS review: the inbetweener you can’t ignore,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/apple-iphone-xs-review?pid=32952," Have you heard of “middle child syndrome”? It’s the (unscientific) theory that kids that have both older and younger siblings tend to feel ignored and excluded, because parents tend to pay more attention to the firstborn and baby of the family. As a mom, I don’t agree with the idea, but since I write about tech, I couldn’t help but draw comparisons with this year’s iPhonesThe iPhone XS Max is the shining star of the new lineup – with its large display and battery, it’s the one that most people have their eyes on. The iPhone XR on the other hand is the most affordable (by Apple standards) device of the lot, and is an attractive option for those with tighter purse strings. So where does that leave the iPhone XS? It doesn’t have the big battery or display of the XS Max, nor is it anywhere close to affordable. But as I found after using the device for a couple of weeks, this ‘middle child’ is pretty special too.  Before I continue, I’d urge you to head over to our iPhone XS Max review if you want the finer details. If not, read on.   If you like compact phones or have smaller hands, the iPhone XS should be your go-to option. With a display measuring 5.8-inches, it’s ideal for one-handed usage, especially since it borrows the full screen design of the iPhone X (review). Like its predecessor, the iPhone XS also uses intuitive gestures in lieu of the home button (RIP, Touch ID), and this, frankly, makes one-handed use even easier. The OLED screen is gorgeous of course, with rich colours and deep blacks – ideal for watching videos, playing games or even scrolling through Instagram feeds. The display supports HDR too, so you can watch HDR content from YouTube and other streaming services.   The cameras on the iPhone XS are the same as the XS Max – that means you get optically stabilised dual 12MP primary shooters, one with an f/1.8 wide-angle lens, and one with an f/2.4 telephoto lens that supports 2x optical zoom. The results speak for themselves. The iPhone XS churns out some of the most professional shots I’ve seen on a smartphone camera till date. Details are crisp, low-light images are relatively noise-free and dynamic range is on point (thank you, Smart HDR). There’s a marked difference even compared to the iPhone X (more details on this in our XS Max review), so you’ll definitely notice a big improvement if you’re upgrading from an old.   While Portrait mode continues to be available, along with the various lighting effects like Natural, Contour, Stage and Mono, this time around you can also adjust the background blur using a slider after shooting. It’s a feature that we’ve seen on Android phones on the past, but it’s nice to have it nonetheless. The 7MP selfie camera offers Portrait mode as well, along with adjustable blur.); } Powering the iPhone XS is Apple’s latest A12 Bionic chip, which is incidentally the first 7nm chipset to be available on a smartphone (Huawei’s Kirin 980 7nm processor was announced earlier though). Apple says the A12 Bionic is 15 percent faster than the A11, which means you won’t notice a big difference if you’re upgrading from an iPhone X (or 8/8 Plus). That said, the iPhone XS was buttery smooth in day to day use, even with 20+ apps running in the background or when playing demanding games. iOS 12 is the cherry on top. It’s designed to make apps faster and animations smoother, and brings in extras like grouped notifications, Screen Time and Memoji, among others. Apple has made a couple of other internal improvements to the iPhone XS. For one, it’s now IP68-certified (vs IP67 on the iPhone X) for dust- and water-resistance, which means it can be submerged in up to two metres of water for 30 minutes. Second, it also comes with faster wireless charging – according to The Verge, it charges 30 minutes faster than the iPhone X, which is a significant improvement.   I never thought I’d see the day Apple released a dual-SIM iPhone, but I’m happy to have been proved wrong. To enable this ubiquitous feature, Apple has used a combination of a regular nano-SIM and an e-SIM, and the latter of which will be available on Airtel and Jio (possibly other operators too) in India. Support for the e-SIM unfortunately isn’t here yet, and will roll out as an update later this year.       Unpopular opinion alert – I’m not a fan of Face ID. I know it works most of the time, but it’s still not as flawless as a fingerprint sensor. There are multiples times each day that Face ID doesn’t unlock the phone on the first try, and I’ve had to punch in my passcode more times than I can count.  While still impressive, Portrait Mode on the iPhone XS struggles with defining borders. As a result, I often ended up with soft or flared edges around subjects. In a couple of photos I took of my dog Zoe, the iPhone XS actually took a chunk out of her face. Google on the other hand seems to have mastered the art of bokeh with the Pixel 2 and 3, and that’s just with a single camera.  I don’t think I’ll ever get over phone manufacturers getting rid of the 3.5mm headphone jack. But this year, Apple has chosen to exclude the 3.5mm to Lightning adapter in the iPhone XS’ retail box, which is unfortunate given that there isn’t a wide choice for third-party Lightning earphones.  Apple says the iPhone XS offers 30 minutes more battery life than the iPhone X. In my usage, I got about four hours of screen time on average, but I still needed to plug the phone in before bedtime on most days. Add to this, there’s still no fast charger in the box, even though the iPhone XS supports fast charging.  The iPhone XS comes with its share of compromises, but it’s still one of the most powerful smartphones in the market today. And while I’m loath to advocate spending upwards of a lakh on a phone (my MacBook Air is half the price of the 512GB iPhone XS), iPhones tend to be worth the investment thanks to their good resale value and long-term iOS updates. That begs the question, is the iPhone XS the one to buy this year? Personally, I’m willing to forgo extra battery life on the XS Max to avoid struggling to reach the corners of the screen. And as much as the iPhone XR seems like a tempting proposition with its lower price tag, the single camera and lower-res LCD display are significant compromises, given that a Pixel 3 (first impressions) costs less. For me, the ‘middle child’ of the iPhone lineup is my favourite, and the one I think you should consider if you plan to upgrade.  Photos by Raj Rout  "
2273,30,20262,,,2014-08-04,,20262,Ketaki Bhojnagarwala -,ASUS Zenfone 4 review: a game-changer in the budget arena,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-zenfone-4-review?pid=20262," “The Zenfone 4 offers a tempting combination of mid-range specs and budget pricing.”  In the span of just six months, the smartphone landscape in India has changed dramatically. While the cream of the crop try to wow us with superstar brand ambassadors, powerful processors and pixel-packed displays, it’s the new breed of budget smartphones that are grabbing all the attention. Packing in features and specs we were paying double, and in some cases, even triple for earlier, the current generation of budget smartphones offer tremendous value for money. While the Moto E (review) can be credited for igniting this trend, we’ve had several capable launches that followed. None, however, are as compelling as the ASUS Zenfone 4. The seemingly unassuming device fits in a ton of goodies in a small frame. We recently reviewed its bigger sibling, the Zenfone 5, which is currently one of the best choices in the mid-range category. So will the Zenfone 4 grab a similar spot in the budget segment? We aim to find out in our review.  Around the edges, you’ll find the 3.5mm audio jack on top, micro-USB port on the left, and volume rocker and power button on the right. The back sports the primary camera (sans flash) and loudspeaker on top. The rear can be pried open (with great difficulty the first few times), after which it becomes too loose for our liking. Inside, there are two micro-SIM card slots, the 1,600mAH battery, and microSD card slot. It’s worth pointing out that while the Zenfone 5 featured a fixed battery, the one on the Zenfone 4 is user replaceable.  We should mention that the quality of ports and buttons weren’t of the highest quality. The USB port has some visible denting around the edges, while the power and volume buttons are flimsily attached to the back panel, and are liable to pop out when the rear cover is open. While the Zenfone 5 offers a 720p display, on the Zenfone 4 you get a meagre 840 x 480 pixels resolution. Because of the smaller 4-inch screen size, the pixel density is an acceptable 233ppi, but the display isn’t as sharp as we’d like. Text on webpages appears jagged when zoomed in, and photos and videos don’t stand out either. The display is also highly reflective, so it isn’t ideal for watching videos. Unfortunately, the Zenfone 4 doesn’t feature an ambient light sensor, so you’ll need to adjust brightness manually. ASUS has provided a sliding meter to adjust brightness via the notification bar, but we still found ourselves having to tweak it frequently. On the plus side, the screen does get Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection, a rarity on smartphones in this price range. And most importantly, it was very responsive, smooth and fluid to the touch, and great for typing too.   Given its price tag, we didn’t expect much from the Zenfone’s camera, but it’s a definite improvement over the Moto E’s lone 5MP fixed-focus shooter. While the Zenfone 4 also offers a 5-megapixel snapper at the back, it does have autofocus. ASUS has also been generous enough to throw in a front camera with VGA resolution, which isn’t ideal for selfies but should suffice for Skype calls. The camera is also endowed with ASUS’ PixelMaster tech to improve image quality. In auto mode, results weren’t very impressive, with close-ups showing evidence of grain and landscape shots appearing washed out. Images taken in low light are predictably grainy, and at night photos are too dark to make out much detail. The camera app offers several modes though, which drastically improve images. The Depth of Field mode works well for macros, keeping the subject in focus and creating a realistic blurry background. The HDR mode is one of the better ones we’ve seen on a smartphone, and the Night mode was surprisingly effective, bringing out more detail otherwise dark shots. There are a few other interesting modes available, like a Selfie mode that uses the primary camera, Smart Remove that lets you remove unwanted objects, and GIF Animation to (you guessed it) create GIFs. The camera also has several colour effects which you can apply in real time, such as Grayscale, Sepia, Pencil, Lomo, Negative and more.  Here are a few image samples. Click on the thumbnails to view them in full resolution. The Zenfone 4 runs Android 4.3 Jelly Bean, with the custom ASUS ZenUI on top. ASUS has promised an update to KitKat, but it hasn’t arrived as yet. Like we noted in our Zenfone 5 review, ZenUI is one of the nicest skins we’ve seen on Android. Consisting of colourful icons and several useful apps and widgets, it offers several additions to stock Android, but doesn’t cause the phone to become sluggish.   The lockscreen displays shortcuts for calling, sending texts and accessing the camera, and displays the time and weather via the What’s Next widget. The app drawer has a handy feature to lock apps, just in case you want to prevent that pesky aunt from browsing through your embarrassing photos. The dialer app has been completely overhauled, and features a handy call-recording option too.The notification bar has a separate tab for quick settings, but lacks the Glove Mode and Reading Mode we saw on the Zenfone 5. Another missing feature is Easy Mode, which changes icons and text to a larger font. to make it easier for senior citizens to use the device.   There’s a Power Saver mode available, with three modes to choose from. The Ultra-saving mode cuts off all network connections, Optimised mode extends the battery life but retains data, and Customised mode lets you fine tune which apps and connectivity options to keep running.There are several pre-loaded ASUS apps, including Do It Later, SuperNote, Splendid, WebStorage, AudioWizard, PartyLink and Share Link. We’ve explored the features of ZenUI in detail in our Zenfone 5 review, and you can head over to this link for a more comprehensive overview.   The Zenfone 4 is equipped with a dual-core Intel Atom Z2520 processor, clocked at 1.2GHz, and paired with 1GB of RAM and PowerVR SGX544MP2 graphics. The Zenfone 4 didn’t freeze during our two-week testing period and was fine for daily use, but we did notice minor lags when opening apps, especially straight after waking the device. Performance was smooth otherwise, with none of the sluggish behavior we found on the Lava Iris X1 (review). While the smaller display isn’t ideal for gaming, we were pleased to find that the intensive Riptide GP2 played smoothly on the Zenfone 4.   Battery life is sadly an area where the device underperforms. The 1,600mAh unit can barely last a day with regular use, and heavy usage such as watching videos or gaming drains it much faster.   The Zenfone 4 offers a generous 8GB of internal storage, a rarity on smartphones in its price range. Out of this, about 4.47GB is available to use. The microSD card slot can increase the storage by an additional 64GB.   Call quality was loud and clear on both ends, but the proximity sensor malfunctions, and we ended up frequently putting calls on hold, inadvertently recording a call or even muting the caller, which is a major annoyance.  The Zenfone 4 is by no means the perfect device, but when you compare it to the competition in the same price range, its perks become obvious. Unlike most other affordable smartphones, ASUS has been generous with the internal storage on the Zenfone 4, leaving plenty of space to install apps and games. The smartphone also packs in a reliable chipset, a healthy amount of RAM, front and rear cameras, and of course a gorgeous interface courtesy ZenUI. There are areas where the device lacks of course, such as its average display resolution, lack of an ambient light sensor and poor battery life, but if you’re looking for the complete package, it doesn’t get any better than this. The Moto E, its closest competitor, offers better performance and battery life, but misses out with its 4GB of storage and poor camera setup. Priced at Rs 5,999, the Zenfone 4 is a true value-for-money device, and in our opinion, is one of the best budget handsets currently available. And in case you feel 4-inches is too small, you could always check out the 4.5-inch variant, which also packs in a larger 1,750mAh battery, for a marginally higher price of Rs 6,999.

2244,30,32425,,,2018-05-02,,32425,Shekhar Thakran -,ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 review: a powerful phone that aims for the throne,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-zenfone-max-pro-m1-review?pid=32425," ASUS recently launched the Zenfone Max Pro M1 (first impressions) smartphone in India, and thanks to its starting price of Rs 10,999, the device certainly demands a closer look, given the specs it boasts. With its ambition of tackling Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 5 Pro (review) head on, does the Max Pro M1 stand any chance? At least the smartphone’s specifications on paper suggest it does. Read our full review to find out if ASUS’ latest is a worthy contender for the VFM throne or not. The ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 sports a 5.99-inch Full-View IPS display with a screen resolution of 2,160 x 1,080 pixels and an aspect ratio of 18:9. The handset offers good display quality with impressive viewing angles and a maximum brightness of 450 nits, which allows you to use the handset even in bright sunlight. While we pointed out in our first impressions that some users might find the display on the Zenfone Max Pro to be slightly washed out, on spending more time with the smartphone, this concern has diminished to a point where we are more confident about the screen quality. If we talk about the design, the handset comes with a matte black finish that feels really good in the hand. While the company has reduced the bezels on the left and right sides of the display, the top and bottom bezels are still reasonably thick. However, due to the narrow frame, the ZenFone Max Pro M1 is easy to hold with one hand, but as is the case with most recent flagships, reaching the top corners of the screen can often prove to be a challenge.  There is no physical home button at the front and the fingerprint scanner is conveniently located in the middle at the back. The dual-camera setup, accompanied by an LED flash, is located at the top left on the rear. The power buttons and the volume rocker are present at the right edge, while the 3.5mm audio jack, micro-USB port, and loudspeaker grille are present at the bottom. The dedicated dual-SIM card slot is located on the left spine of the smartphone. Despite a massive battery, the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 doesn’t come across as a bulky handset and feels reasonably light and slim in the hand.
 The ZenFone Max Pro M1 comes with a rear-facing dual camera setup, consisting of 13MP + 5MP sensors in a vertical orientation, accompanied by an LED flash. At the front, there is an 8MP shooter for taking selfies. The camera app allows users to click images with depth effect (aka background blur) using both front and rear cameras.  However, there is a stark difference between the quality offered by these camera modules. While the rear shooters managed to take rather decent pictures, especially in well-lit conditions, the front camera could not replicate the performance. The camera performance is not extraordinary in terms of detail, but the overall image quality is still pretty clean. The default camera app allows users to click pictures in different shooting modes, including HDR, Portrait, Landscape, Sports, Flowers, Backlight, Candlelight, Night, and Beach. Unfortunately, these modes don’t offer much variety in terms of the final outcome of the images and were quite similar to the ones clicked in Auto mode. Some of these issues could be fixed with a software update, as the firmware running on our review device isn’t final. Here’s a look at the camera samples. 
On the other side, the camera app allows users to click images with different filters like Mono, Sepia, Negative, Solarize, Posterize, Aqua etc. Our favourite among these modes will have to be Neon, which essentially leaves you with neon object outlines in the imageUsers get the option to adjust ISO as well as exposure from the default camera app itself. Overall, for its price segment, the Zenfone Max Pro offers a really impressive performance with its primary rear-facing camera setup but fails to do so with the front camera.    Powering the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 636 SoC. The handset has been made available in two RAM/storage configurations, i.e. 3GB RAM/32GB storage and 4GB RAM/64GB storage. However, the company has already announced the plans to launch a 6GB RAM variant soon. The storage is expandable up to 2TB via microSD card.  Notably, the Zenfone Max Pro M1 is the first smartphone from ASUS that runs a stock version Android. As you might expect, there is no bloatware on the handset and the company has promised timely updates for the smartphone for next two years as well. The use of vanilla iteration of Google’s OS takes care of one of the biggest issues we had with ASUS phones earlier, as the brand’s previous platform of choice, ZenUI, was quite cluttered and riddled with bloatware. If we talk about the performance, you won’t face any lag or stutter issues while navigating through the UI as well as launching and closing apps. Interestingly, the Zenfone Max Pro delivered a very strong performance and not only handled graphically-intensive games and apps with ease but also presented no issues while running PUBG (mobile version) alongside the Gmail app in Multi-tasking view. As we have a taller-than-usual aspect ratio, the apps can easily be run in square boxes with the multi-tasking option. And the best part is despite playing demanding games on a stretch, the M1 didn’t face any heating issues.If we talk about the audio, the loudspeaker on the Zenfone Max Pro gets really loud at maximum levels but you can feel the quality drop after a certain point. The sound levels are impressive but the compromise in quality at high volume levels leaves something to be desired. We must point out that the Max-Box accessory provided by the company does amplify the handset’s audio to an extent but as you cannot use the handset in landscape mode with the accessory, it doesn’t really comes across as a particularly useful addition for an immersive multimedia experienceh. However, does the massive capacity actually translate into longer battery life? The answer is, a not-so confident yes. In our test, where we run an HD video on loop till the phone’s battery is completely drained out, the Zenfone Max Pro M1 managed to last around 18 hours, which cannot be deemed overly impressive. To provide further perspective, the Smartron t.phone P, which also comes with a 5,000mAh battery managed to last around 21 hours in this same test for us while the Redmi Note 5 Pro, which comes with a 4,000mAh cell, also delivered 21 hours of battery life in this test, despite a lower battery capacity. That said, the ASUS’ smartphone will easily last through a day on a single charge, even with heavy usage. While the handset doesn’t support quick charge feature, it comes with a 2W adapter to juice up quickly.    The pricing for ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 starts from Rs 10,999 in India and the handset will be made available for purchase exclusively from Flipkart. In this segment, the new smartphone from ASUS will be directly competing against the likes of Honor’s 9 Lite (review) / 7X (review) and Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 5 (review) / Note 5 Pro. However, it’s biggest competitor would be the Redmi Note 5 Pro, and in terms of performance, we can clearly see that the M1 packs a punch and can compete with Xiaomi’s offering toe-to-toe. But in terms of image quality, it remains a step behind.  Having said that, large battery and a neat design make Zenfone Max Pro a compelling option, especially considering the fact Xiaomi’s smartphone has recently got a price bump of Rs 1,000. So, we will have to wait and see if the handset actually manages to match the Redmi Note 5 Pro in terms of popularity or falls short despite offering good value. Photos by Raj Rout"

In this segment, the new smartphone from ASUS will be directly competing against the likes of Honor’s 9 Lite (review) / 7X (review) and Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 5 (review) / Note 5 Pro. However, it’s biggest competitor would be the Redmi Note 5 Pro, and in terms of performance, we can clearly see that the M1 packs a punch and can compete with Xiaomi’s offering toe-to-toe. But in terms of image quality, it remains a step behind.  Having said that, large battery and a neat design make Zenfone Max Pro a compelling option, especially considering the fact Xiaomi’s smartphone has recently got a price bump of Rs 1,000. So, we will have to wait and see if the handset actually manages to match the Redmi Note 5 Pro in terms of popularity or falls short despite offering good value. Photos by Raj Rout"
1684,30,28880,,,2016-09-26,,28880,Deeksha Koli -,Gionee S6s review: a decent smartphone for the selfie lover,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/gionee-s6s-review?pid=28880," With the ever-increasing craze for food, travel, casual photography, being active on social media etc, comes a need for a handy shooter for which smartphones suffice. Having replaced point-and-shoots, smartphone cameras help you click anytime, anywhere and allow you to instantly share your life with others.  A recent addition to the lot has been the Gionee S6s. A successor to the S6, which was launched in the wake of this year, Gionee S6s takes pride in its 8MP selfie shooter, complemented by an LED flash module. Along with that, the phone offers a metal unibody build and decent specifications, at least on paper. We’ve been using the phone as our primary driver for a while now, and here’s what we think. The Gionee S6s comes in gold and has a unibody full metal design as we mentioned earlier… which means it doesn’t stray too far away from the design of many other phones we’ve seen lately  The smartphone doesn’t do anything new in this department and settles with what’s already popular, which is not necessarily a bad thing. It’s a stylish looking phone that won’t make you stand out from the crowd, but rather let you be a part of it. However, there are a few details which got our attention. The copper ring around the primary camera module, which is followed by three more round entities including the flash, fingerprint reader, and Gionee’s branding makes for an eye-catching sight.  The power key gets concentric circles engraved on it, while the volume key is smooth, helping you easily feel the difference when you’re not looking at the phone and using it. The rest of the port and button placement is usual. The phone justifies its price tag when it comes to build quality. Despite not being extremely slim, nor too light, the Gionee S6s sits in the hand comfortably. But the slightly slippery back panel is somewhat of an issue. Using the Gionee S6s with a single hand won’t be a piece of cake. The Gionee S6s uses a 5.5-inch full HD panel with a 2.5D curved glass on top. While spotted in a completely different price segment, 2K displays are no longer a rare sight, and having looked at those, we felt that the sharpness on S6s’ screen was not eye-searing. The colours, however, look good and vivid. The screen brightness was good, both indoors and outdoors. The screen on the phone is not too reflective, so using it under the harsh sun wasn’t an ordeal. Viewing angles were great, and overall, using the Gionee S6s while content consumption was a delight. The screen responds to touch extremely well, too.The shooting department is where the Gionee S6s is game for anything. Equipped with a 13MP primary camera, aided by an LED flash, and the 8MP front-camera configuration, the device may not sound like a shooting beast, but it does a fairly decent job. The primary snapper captures great details and colours, with the output looking rich and not dull. However, some lighting situations led to slightly warmer colour reproduction. The camera performs average in low light conditions, while night photography was pretty decent. That said, you should expect some grain. The front camera steals the show with incredibly detailed selfies. However, the Face Beauty 2.0, which is one of the highlights about the phone, leads to gimmicky pictures if not tuned properly. Low light selfies were extremely hazy, but you have a selfie flash at your disposal, with three usage options including flash, steady light, and screen flash, to take care of such situations.To take an in-depth look at the camera app interface, and the shooting prowess of the Gionee S6s, you may head to our camera review. Meanwhile, here are a couple of pictures clicked with the primary camera of the smartphone. The Gionee S6s runs the company’s own Amigo UI v3.2 on top of Android Marshmallow. Consequently, you don’t find an app drawer, but you do find a tweaked icon pack.     The notification panel can be accessed by using the good old way, however, all the quick settings are revealed by swiping up from the bottom of the display. The UI comes loaded with features and apps. There’s Mood Wallpaper which lets you subscribe to differently themed wallpapers for your lockscreen which then change periodically. Another customisation app is Theme Park. You also find gesture control, allowing you to use either motion or draw certain shapes and letters on the standby screen to access apps or perform other functions. There’s Gionee’s own System Manager to boost your phone’s performance. For a closer look at the user interface of the S6s, you can check out our review of the Gionee Elife E8.  The S6s offers 32GB of inbuilt storage, out of which you get around 26GB for personal use. You may top up the storage up by another 128GB using a microSD card. The phone comes preloaded with quite a few third party applications as well, which include Swiftkey Keyboard, Facebook, Instagram, UC Browser, Hotoday, Messenger, and Truecaller. These apps cannot be uninstalled, which is a little disappointing. The UI operates smoothly, and is a decent upgrade over the Android Lollipop based Amigo UI, however, we feel that the animations are a bit too much, and lead to a slight lag. The fingerprint scanner on the Gionee S6s can be used to unlock the device, and click pictures as well. You obviously don’t need to store a fingerprint to do the latter. Setting up the fingerprint scanner was quick and easy, and the sensor works well. It’s not the fastest that we’ve used lately, but it does the job well, and rarely misses out on recognising the fingerprints. The 1.3GHz octa-core MediaTek MT6753 chip in the Gionee S6s might not sound like the most powerful, nut the phone performs well as a daily driver. The SoC is coupled with 3GB of RAM. We didn’t encounter any major lags in everyday use. The phone takes on multitasking easily, as well. However, you might encounter a few stutters in that case.  Coming to heavy usage, we played titles like Asphalt 8: Airborn and Modern Combat 5: Blackout and the phone handled the gaming like a pro, with no visible lags during the initial few minutes. Around 30 to 40 minutes into the game, we did encounter some jitters and frame drops. The Gionee S6s starts heating up as well, to noticeable but not uncomfortable levels.Call quality on the phone was decent, but we did experience network reception issues in certain areas. The loudspeaker output was average, and the placement of the grille on the back leads to muffled sound in certain positions. The bundled earphones ship with silicon buds, which are comfortable to wear for longer periods of time at a stretch. The output was decent with good mids, perfect for listening to tracks like Kala Chashma, not so perfect if you listen to bands like, say Porcupine Tree.The S6s is a 4G VoLTE enable phone with hybrid dual-SIM slots, and offers other standard connectivity options like Wi-Fi a/b/g/n, Bluetooth v4.0, and micro-USB slot with USB OTG capabilities.The Gionee S6s is powered by a 3,150mAh battery, which is non-removable. With mixed use, the phone easily delivers a day of use, with some battery still spare for you to not get paranoid the next day, reach your work calmly, and charge the device. On our standard battery test, the Gionee S6s lasted for a little over 12 hours and 45 minutes, which we consider as a good result. The screen-on time was around three and a half hours. That said, the standby time offered by the smartphone is not as impressive. To help you avoid battery crisis, the Gionee S6s offers a Power Saving mode and an Extreme Power Saving mode. With the 2A rated bundled charger, the Gionee S6s takes a little over two and a half hours to charge fully.  The Gionee S6s offers decent design and a good display. You also get a nice pair of shooters, with the selfie cam playing the star of the show. The battery backup on offer is adequate, and the performance should suffice most users unless you intend to use the phone purely for high-end gaming.At its price, which is Rs 17,999, the Gionee S6s faces stiff competition from the recently launched OPPO F1s (review), which is a selfie-centric phone and sports a whopping 16MP front camera for a similar price. However, the OPPO F1s does not feature a front-facing LED flash. Talking just about the specs, we find more sense in placing the S6s against the likes of the Lenovo ZUK Z1 (review), and the Moto G4 Plus (review), all of which are decently loaded phones with good cameras, and offer comparable specifications. Or if you need a performance beast, the newly launched Lenovo Z2 Plus (first impressions) should definitely be on the top of your list.The Gionee S6s is a decent daily driver. However, if you’re looking for an all-rounder, we bet you can find a smartphone for a significantly lesser price. But, if you’re all about selfies, we’d recommend the Gionee S6s for more detailed and natural selfies or the OPPO F1s if you’re looking for a great beautification mode on your camera app."
2457,30,33597,3.5,5,2019-01-11,,33597,Prateek Pandey -,Honor 10 Lite review: more than just a pretty face,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/honor-10-lite-review?pid=33597," “Our two cents on Honor’s first smartphone for 2019 – the 10 Lite Last year, the editorial team at 91mobiles reviewed seven different smartphones from Chinese manufacturer Honor. The devices ranged from entry-level offerings to flagship-grade smartphones and barring a select few, most of them left a positive impression on us. Suffice it to say, Honor really stepped up its game in 2018 and to kickstart the new year, the brand recently announced a new mid-ranger in the country. Dubbed the Honor 10 Lite (first impressions), the smartphone ships with an eye-catchy design, dual-cameras… basically the whole shebang. But, does it do enough to sway buyers away from the competition? Well, let’s find out in this review.   Honor has a knack for designing stunning affordable smartphones which can even put some high-end devices to shame with their gorgeous aesthetics. The Honor 10 Lite builds upon the brand’s legacy and can be seen sporting a glossy gradient finish towards the back, which is striking, to say the least. Now, if you don’t like loud colours, then you may not prefer the shade of my review unit, which shipped in a bright blue hue. However, I quite fancy the design of the device, and in any case, the phone’s available in a more sedate black too. Even though the finish doesn’t shift colour when I tilt the smartphone, it still comes across as unique and different.Unfortunately, while I loved the overall look of the smartphone, the in-hand feel leaves something to be desired. You see, the 10 Lite is made out of plastic, which does feel a tad, err… plasticky. Thankfully, the handset’s curved back makes for an excellent grip. So much so, you need not invest in a third-party case as I rarely felt the device slip from between my fingers.The physical buttons positioned on the right spine of the device felt adequately tactile too, and the fingerprint sensor at the back has been positioned in such a way that it comfortably aligned with my index finger. As for the accuracy of the sensor, I didn’t face any issues unlocking the device in one go, though it does feel a tad bit slow. Every time I tapped my finger on the sensor, the smartphone took a second before the screen lit up.Honor does include face unlock with the device, which in my experience, is a much more convenient way to unlock the device. Notably, the screen automatically wakes up when you lift the smartphone, and therefore, you won’t have to press the power button to trigger face unlock… making the process seamless.  The Honor 10 Lite ships with a micro-USB port for charging, which is a bit disappointing when you take into consideration that similarly priced devices like the Xiaomi Mi A2 (review) feature a more modern, Type-C port. Thankfully, the device retains the headphone jack which means you’ll be able to plug in just about any pair of 3.5mm headphones into the smartphone to listen to music. Let’s face it – for most people, smartphones have all but replaced TVs as the primary means to consume media. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that buyers seek smartphones with vibrant, high-resolution panels. To that extent, the Honor 10 Lite doesn’t disappoint. The smartphone ships with a 6.21-inch FHD+ IPS LCD display with an impressive screen-to-body ratio of 91.25 percent. To achieve the staggering screen real estate without increasing the overall dimensions of the device, folks at Honor have trimmed down the bezels surrounding the display and have opted for a subtle dewdrop notch, positioned at the centre. Much to my surprise, despite shipping with an LCD panel, the Honor 10 Lite exhibited punchy, tasteful colours which made using the smartphone a treat to the eyes. Moreover, the panel gets sufficiently bright outdoors and therefore, you’ll not have to squint your eyes to see what’s on the display Gone are the days when buyers had to settle for a so-so camera when buying an affordable smartphone. Devices like Xiaomi’s Mi A2 and the Realme 2 Pro are a testament to the fact that one need not splurge on their next device to get a spectacular camera. Can then, the Honor 10 Lite prove its mettle in the photography department and stand out? Well, before I talk about the camera quality, let’s get the specs out of the way.   The Honor 10 Lite ships with a dual-camera setup at the back comprising 13MP and 2MP sensors with f/1.8 and f.2.4 apertures respectively. For selfies, the handset comes with a 24MP f/2.0 snapper. As is the case with most other smartphones from the company’s stables, the Honor 10 Lite makes use of AI to automatically choose from various scenes and adjust the camera settings accordingly. The camera app is feature-rich, fairly straightforward to use and comes with various photo modes, including portrait, beauty and night mode.   Coming to the quality of the rear-facing cameras, the Honor 10 Lite can at times surprise you with incredible shots. However, I did encounter some issues whilst taking photos with the device. For starters, the camera has a few exposure issues and you might need to manually tweak the settings to take care of that. Secondly, the portrait mode is a tad iffy, and as can be seen from the sample shots I clicked with the device, the blur effect is not seamless. Then there’s the unnecessary beautification and the fact that the shots taken with the AI enabled looked oversaturated. That said, the AI mode captures a regular photo too, so you could just use that if you don’t like what you see with the feature turned on.
                 There is some light at the end of the tunnel. As I mentioned previously, some shots I took with the Honor 10 Lite really did take me by a surprise. For instance, if you’re the type who likes to take close-ups, then you’ll find yourself right at home with the 10 Lite as the macros I clicked with the smartphone were evenly exposed and rich in detail. Moreover, the AI scene recognition does wonders for architectural photography as it adds a much-needed boost to dull and muted colours of buildings. In low-light scenarios, the handset’s night mode does a mighty fine job of stabilising the image and snapping a sharp, detailed photo.I was extremely satisfied with the smartphone’s selfie camera too. Now, you’ll want to turn off the AI scene detection whilst clicking selfies if you want your portraits to captured showing your natural skin tone. However, with the setting disabled, you can get away with some incredible-looking self-portraits which look pleasing to the eyes. At night, the handset’s built-in screen flash functionality kicks in, which should help you salvage a half decent selfie in darkness.  The Honor 10 Lite is backed by Huawei’s in-house Kirin 710 processor which works alongside 4GB of RAM and 64GB of user-expandable storage. During my time with the device, I seldom ran into stutters while navigating through the UI. Apps opened swiftly and despite shipping with just 4GB of RAM, multitasking was buttery smooth too, as the device managed to keep half a dozen apps in memory at any given moment.  That said, playing intensive titles like PUBG isn’t a very smooth experience on the Honor 10 Lite. While the smartphone comfortably managed to run the game on medium graphics setting, there were noticeable frame drops during the heat of a battle. On the flip side, casual games like Dead Warfare, PAKO Forever, and Go Plane worked flawlessly on the device.  On a related note, the smartphone’s software doesn’t play well with certain games and applications. For instance, in PUBG, a good chunk of the device’s display was blacked out. While you can force the smartphone to run games in full-screen mode, it might lead to app crashes and display errors.     The Honor 10 Lite is fuelled by a 3,400mAh battery which lasted a full day on moderate usage. However, I found myself reaching for the charger whenever I pushed the smartphone too hard. In our battery test, the smartphone drained completely in 13 hours, which is a decent result, but I expected more out of the handset’s 3,400mAh cell.    Coming to the software, the Honor 10 Lite boots Android Pie with a custom skin of EMUI v9 on top. If you’re not a fan of third-party skins, then EMUI will do little to change your opinion. It’s quite a way from stock Android and comes riddled with a bunch of bloatware and Honor’s own applications, most of which cannot be uninstalled. On the bright side, you do get some nifty features with the skin, such as the ability to mute incoming notifications by flipping the device and a full-fledged theme store to satiate all your customisation cravings. The Honor 10 Lite is expected to be priced between Rs 13K to Rs 14K, which pits the device against smartphones like the Realme U1 (review), the Realme 2 Pro (review), the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2 (review) and the Xiaomi Mi A2. While the Honor 10 Lite has a lot going for it, including a good-looking design and dependable performance, it does little to stand out from the herd of other compelling choices. That said, my verdict could change if the smartphone is priced more competitively.   I’ll make sure to update this review when the device launches and we get to know it’s exact pricing.

Much to my surprise, despite shipping with an LCD panel, the Honor 10 Lite exhibited punchy, tasteful colours which made using the smartphone a treat to the eyes. Moreover, the panel gets sufficiently bright outdoors and therefore, you’ll not have to squint your eyes to see what’s on the display Gone are the days when buyers had to settle for a so-so camera when buying an affordable smartphone. Devices like Xiaomi’s Mi A2 and the Realme 2 Pro are a testament to the fact that one need not splurge on their next device to get a spectacular camera. Can then, the Honor 10 Lite prove its mettle in the photography department and stand out? Well, before I talk about the camera quality, let’s get the specs out of the way.   The Honor 10 Lite ships with a dual-camera setup at the back comprising 13MP and 2MP sensors with f/1.8 and f.2.4 apertures respectively. For selfies, the handset comes with a 24MP f/2.0 snapper. As is the case with most other smartphones from the company’s stables, the Honor 10 Lite makes use of AI to automatically choose from various scenes and adjust the camera settings accordingly. The camera app is feature-rich, fairly straightforward to use and comes with various photo modes, including portrait, beauty and night mode.   Coming to the quality of the rear-facing cameras, the Honor 10 Lite can at times surprise you with incredible shots. However, I did encounter some issues whilst taking photos with the device. For starters, the camera has a few exposure issues and you might need to manually tweak the settings to take care of that. Secondly, the portrait mode is a tad iffy, and as can be seen from the sample shots I clicked with the device, the blur effect is not seamless. Then there’s the unnecessary beautification and the fact that the shots taken with the AI enabled looked oversaturated. That said, the AI mode captures a regular photo too, so you could just use that if you don’t like what you see with the feature turned on.
There is some light at the end of the tunnel. As I mentioned previously, some shots I took with the Honor 10 Lite really did take me by a surprise. For instance, if you’re the type who likes to take close-ups, then you’ll find yourself right at home with the 10 Lite as the macros I clicked with the smartphone were evenly exposed and rich in detail. Moreover, the AI scene recognition does wonders for architectural photography as it adds a much-needed boost to dull and muted colours of buildings. In low-light scenarios, the handset’s night mode does a mighty fine job of stabilising the image and snapping a sharp, detailed photo. I was extremely satisfied with the smartphone’s selfie camera too. Now, you’ll want to turn off the AI scene detection whilst clicking selfies if you want your portraits to captured showing your natural skin tone. However, with the setting disabled, you can get away with some incredible-looking self-portraits which look pleasing to the eyes. At night, the handset’s built-in screen flash functionality kicks in, which should help you salvage a half decent selfie in darkness.  The Honor 10 Lite is backed by Huawei’s in-house Kirin 710 processor which works alongside 4GB of RAM and 64GB of user-expandable storage. During my time with the device, I seldom ran into stutters while navigating through the UI. Apps opened swiftly and despite shipping with just 4GB of RAM, multitasking was buttery smooth too, as the device managed to keep half a dozen apps in memory at any given moment.  That said, playing intensive titles like PUBG isn’t a very smooth experience on the Honor 10 Lite. While the smartphone comfortably managed to run the game on medium graphics setting, there were noticeable frame drops during the heat of a battle. On the flip side, casual games like Dead Warfare, PAKO Forever, and Go Plane worked flawlessly on the device.  On a related note, the smartphone’s software doesn’t play well with certain games and applications. For instance, in PUBG, a good chunk of the device’s display was blacked out. While you can force the smartphone to run games in full-screen mode, it might lead to app crashes and display errors.     The Honor 10 Lite is fuelled by a 3,400mAh battery which lasted a full day on moderate usage. However, I found myself reaching for the charger whenever I pushed the smartphone too hard. In our battery test, the smartphone drained completely in 13 hours, which is a decent result, but I expected more out of the handset’s 3,400mAh cell.    Coming to the software, the Honor 10 Lite boots Android Pie with a custom skin of EMUI v9 on top. If you’re not a fan of third-party skins, then EMUI will do little to change your opinion. It’s quite a way from stock Android and comes riddled with a bunch of bloatware and Honor’s own applications, most of which cannot be uninstalled. On the bright side, you do get some nifty features with the skin, such as the ability to mute incoming notifications by flipping the device and a full-fledged theme store to satiate all your customisation cravings. The Honor 10 Lite is expected to be priced between Rs 13K to Rs 14K, which pits the device against smartphones like the Realme U1 (review), the Realme 2 Pro (review), the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2 (review) and the Xiaomi Mi A2. While the Honor 10 Lite has a lot going for it, including a good-looking design and dependable performance, it does little to stand out from the herd of other compelling choices. That said, my verdict could change if the smartphone is priced more competitively.   I’ll make sure to update this review when the device launches and we get to know it’s exact pricing.

The devices ranged from entry-level offerings to flagship-grade smartphones and barring a select few, most of them left a positive impression on us. Suffice it to say, Honor really stepped up its game in 2018 and to kickstart the new year, the brand recently announced a new mid-ranger in the country. Dubbed the Honor 10 Lite (first impressions), the smartphone ships with an eye-catchy design, dual-cameras… basically the whole shebang. But, does it do enough to sway buyers away from the competition? Well, let’s find out in this review.   Honor has a knack for designing stunning affordable smartphones which can even put some high-end devices to shame with their gorgeous aesthetics. The Honor 10 Lite builds upon the brand’s legacy and can be seen sporting a glossy gradient finish towards the back, which is striking, to say the least. Now, if you don’t like loud colours, then you may not prefer the shade of my review unit, which shipped in a bright blue hue. However, I quite fancy the design of the device, and in any case, the phone’s available in a more sedate black too. Even though the finish doesn’t shift colour when I tilt the smartphone, it still comes across as unique and different Unfortunately, while I loved the overall look of the smartphone, the in-hand feel leaves something to be desired. You see, the 10 Lite is made out of plastic, which does feel a tad, err… plasticky. Thankfully, the handset’s curved back makes for an excellent grip. So much so, you need not invest in a third-party case as I rarely felt the device slip from between my fingers. The physical buttons positioned on the right spine of the device felt adequately tactile too, and the fingerprint sensor at the back has been positioned in such a way that it comfortably aligned with my index finger. As for the accuracy of the sensor, I didn’t face any issues unlocking the device in one go, though it does feel a tad bit slow. Every time I tapped my finger on the sensor, the smartphone took a second before the screen lit up. Honor does include face unlock with the device, which in my experience, is a much more convenient way to unlock the device. Notably, the screen automatically wakes up when you lift the smartphone, and therefore, you won’t have to press the power button to trigger face unlock… making the process seamless.  The Honor 10 Lite ships with a micro-USB port for charging, which is a bit disappointing when you take into consideration that similarly priced devices like the Xiaomi Mi A2 (review) feature a more modern, Type-C port. Thankfully, the device retains the headphone jack which means you’ll be able to plug in just about any pair of 3.5mm headphones into the smartphone to listen to music.Let’s face it – for most people, smartphones have all but replaced TVs as the primary means to consume media. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that buyers seek smartphones with vibrant, high-resolution panels. To that extent, the Honor 10 Lite doesn’t disappoint.

On the bright side, you do get some nifty features with the skin, such as the ability to mute incoming notifications by flipping the device and a full-fledged theme store to satiate all your customisation cravings. The Honor 10 Lite is expected to be priced between Rs 13K to Rs 14K, which pits the device against smartphones like the Realme U1 (review), the Realme 2 Pro (review), the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2 (review) and the Xiaomi Mi A2. While the Honor 10 Lite has a lot going for it, including a good-looking design and dependable performance, it does little to stand out from the herd of other compelling choices. That said, my verdict could change if the smartphone is priced more competitively.   I’ll make sure to update this review when the device launches and we get to know it’s exact pricing.

2457,30,33597,3.5,5,2019-01-11,,33597,Prateek Pandey -,Honor 10 Lite review: more than just a pretty face,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/honor-10-lite-review?pid=33597," “Our two cents on Honor’s first smartphone for 2019 – the 10 Lite Last year, the editorial team at 91mobiles reviewed seven different smartphones from Chinese manufacturer Honor. The devices ranged from entry-level offerings to flagship-grade smartphones and barring a select few, most of them left a positive impression on us. Suffice it to say, Honor really stepped up its game in 2018 and to kickstart the new year, the brand recently announced a new mid-ranger in the country. Dubbed the Honor 10 Lite (first impressions), the smartphone ships with an eye-catchy design, dual-cameras… basically the whole shebang. But, does it do enough to sway buyers away from the competition? Well, let’s find out in this review.   Honor has a knack for designing stunning affordable smartphones which can even put some high-end devices to shame with their gorgeous aesthetics. The Honor 10 Lite builds upon the brand’s legacy and can be seen sporting a glossy gradient finish towards the back, which is striking, to say the least. Now, if you don’t like loud colours, then you may not prefer the shade of my review unit, which shipped in a bright blue hue. However, I quite fancy the design of the device, and in any case, the phone’s available in a more sedate black too. Even though the finish doesn’t shift colour when I tilt the smartphone, it still comes across as unique and different.Unfortunately, while I loved the overall look of the smartphone, the in-hand feel leaves something to be desired. You see, the 10 Lite is made out of plastic, which does feel a tad, err… plasticky. Thankfully, the handset’s curved back makes for an excellent grip. So much so, you need not invest in a third-party case as I rarely felt the device slip from between my fingers. The physical buttons positioned on the right spine of the device felt adequately tactile too, and the fingerprint sensor at the back has been positioned in such a way that it comfortably aligned with my index finger. As for the accuracy of the sensor, I didn’t face any issues unlocking the device in one go, though it does feel a tad bit slow. Every time I tapped my finger on the sensor, the smartphone took a second before the screen lit up. Honor does include face unlock with the device, which in my experience, is a much more convenient way to unlock the device. Notably, the screen automatically wakes up when you lift the smartphone, and therefore, you won’t have to press the power button to trigger face unlock… making the process seamless.  The Honor 10 Lite ships with a micro-USB port for charging, which is a bit disappointing when you take into consideration that similarly priced devices like the Xiaomi Mi A2 (review) feature a more modern, Type-C port. Thankfully, the device retains the headphone jack which means you’ll be able to plug in just about any pair of 3.5mm headphones into the smartphone to listen to music. Let’s face it – for most people, smartphones have all but replaced TVs as the primary means to consume media. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that buyers seek smartphones with vibrant, high-resolution panels. To that extent, the Honor 10 Lite doesn’t disappoint. The smartphone ships with a 6.21-inch FHD+ IPS LCD display with an impressive screen-to-body ratio of 91.25 percent. To achieve the staggering screen real estate without increasing the overall dimensions of the device, folks at Honor have trimmed down the bezels surrounding the display and have opted for a subtle dewdrop notch, positioned at the centre. Much to my surprise, despite shipping with an LCD panel, the Honor 10 Lite exhibited punchy, tasteful colours which made using the smartphone a treat to the eyes. Moreover, the panel gets sufficiently bright outdoors and therefore, you’ll not have to squint your eyes to see what’s on the display.are the days when buyers had to settle for a so-so camera when buying an affordable smartphone. Devices like Xiaomi’s Mi A2 and the Realme 2 Pro are a testament to the fact that one need not splurge on their next device to get a spectacular camera. Can then, the Honor 10 Lite prove its mettle in the photography department and stand out? Well, before I talk about the camera quality, let’s get the specs out of the way.   The Honor 10 Lite ships with a dual-camera setup at the back comprising 13MP and 2MP sensors with f/1.8 and f.2.4 apertures respectively. For selfies, the handset comes with a 24MP f/2.0 snapper. As is the case with most other smartphones from the company’s stables, the Honor 10 Lite makes use of AI to automatically choose from various scenes and adjust the camera settings accordingly. The camera app is feature-rich, fairly straightforward to use and comes with various photo modes, including portrait, beauty and night mode.   Coming to the quality of the rear-facing cameras, the Honor 10 Lite can at times surprise you with incredible shots. However, I did encounter some issues whilst taking photos with the device. For starters, the camera has a few exposure issues and you might need to manually tweak the settings to take care of that. Secondly, the portrait mode is a tad iffy, and as can be seen from the sample shots I clicked with the device, the blur effect is not seamless. Then there’s the unnecessary beautification and the fact that the shots taken with the AI enabled looked oversaturated. That said, the AI mode captures a regular photo too, so you could just use that if you don’t like what you see with the feature turned on.There is some light at the end of the tunnel. As I mentioned previously, some shots I took with the Honor 10 Lite really did take me by a surprise. For instance, if you’re the type who likes to take close-ups, then you’ll find yourself right at home with the 10 Lite as the macros I clicked with the smartphone were evenly exposed and rich in detail. Moreover, the AI scene recognition does wonders for architectural photography as it adds a much-needed boost to dull and muted colours of buildings. In low-light scenarios, the handset’s night mode does a mighty fine job of stabilising the image and snapping a sharp, detailed photo. I was extremely satisfied with the smartphone’s selfie camera too. Now, you’ll want to turn off the AI scene detection whilst clicking selfies if you want your portraits to captured showing your natural skin tone. However, with the setting disabled, you can get away with some incredible-looking self-portraits which look pleasing to the eyes. At night, the handset’s built-in screen flash functionality kicks in, which should help you salvage a half decent selfie in darkness.  The Honor 10 Lite is backed by Huawei’s in-house Kirin 710 processor which works alongside 4GB of RAM and 64GB of user-expandable storage. During my time with the device, I seldom ran into stutters while navigating through the UI. Apps opened swiftly and despite shipping with just 4GB of RAM, multitasking was buttery smooth too, as the device managed to keep half a dozen apps in memory at any given moment.  That said, playing intensive titles like PUBG isn’t a very smooth experience on the Honor 10 Lite. While the smartphone comfortably managed to run the game on medium graphics setting, there were noticeable frame drops during the heat of a battle. On the flip side, casual games like Dead Warfare, PAKO Forever, and Go Plane worked flawlessly on the device.  On a related note, the smartphone’s software doesn’t play well with certain games and applications. For instance, in PUBG, a good chunk of the device’s display was blacked out. While you can force the smartphone to run games in full-screen mode, it might lead to app crashes and display errors.     The Honor 10 Lite is fuelled by a 3,400mAh battery which lasted a full day on moderate usage. However, I found myself reaching for the charger whenever I pushed the smartphone too hard. In our battery test, the smartphone drained completely in 13 hours, which is a decent result, but I expected more out of the handset’s 3,400mAh cell.    Coming to the software, the Honor 10 Lite boots Android Pie with a custom skin of EMUI v9 on top. If you’re not a fan of third-party skins, then EMUI will do little to change your opinion. It’s quite a way from stock Android and comes riddled with a bunch of bloatware and Honor’s own applications, most of which cannot be uninstalled. On the bright side, you do get some nifty features with the skin, such as the ability to mute incoming notifications by flipping the device and a full-fledged theme store to satiate all your customisation cravings.

Moreover, the panel gets sufficiently bright outdoors and therefore, you’ll not have to squint your eyes to see what’s on the display.are the days when buyers had to settle for a so-so camera when buying an affordable smartphone. Devices like Xiaomi’s Mi A2 and the Realme 2 Pro are a testament to the fact that one need not splurge on their next device to get a spectacular camera. Can then, the Honor 10 Lite prove its mettle in the photography department and stand out? Well, before I talk about the camera quality, let’s get the specs out of the way.   The Honor 10 Lite ships with a dual-camera setup at the back comprising 13MP and 2MP sensors with f/1.8 and f.2.4 apertures respectively. For selfies, the handset comes with a 24MP f/2.0 snapper. As is the case with most other smartphones from the company’s stables, the Honor 10 Lite makes use of AI to automatically choose from various scenes and adjust the camera settings accordingly. The camera app is feature-rich, fairly straightforward to use and comes with various photo modes, including portrait, beauty and night mode.   Coming to the quality of the rear-facing cameras, the Honor 10 Lite can at times surprise you with incredible shots. However, I did encounter some issues whilst taking photos with the device. For starters, the camera has a few exposure issues and you might need to manually tweak the settings to take care of that. Secondly, the portrait mode is a tad iffy, and as can be seen from the sample shots I clicked with the device, the blur effect is not seamless. Then there’s the unnecessary beautification and the fact that the shots taken with the AI enabled looked oversaturated. That said, the AI mode captures a regular photo too, so you could just use that if you don’t like what you see with the feature turned on.There is some light at the end of the tunnel. As I mentioned previously, some shots I took with the Honor 10 Lite really did take me by a surprise. For instance, if you’re the type who likes to take close-ups, then you’ll find yourself right at home with the 10 Lite as the macros I clicked with the smartphone were evenly exposed and rich in detail. Moreover, the AI scene recognition does wonders for architectural photography as it adds a much-needed boost to dull and muted colours of buildings. In low-light scenarios, the handset’s night mode does a mighty fine job of stabilising the image and snapping a sharp, detailed photo. I was extremely satisfied with the smartphone’s selfie camera too. Now, you’ll want to turn off the AI scene detection whilst clicking selfies if you want your portraits to captured showing your natural skin tone. However, with the setting disabled, you can get away with some incredible-looking self-portraits which look pleasing to the eyes. At night, the handset’s built-in screen flash functionality kicks in, which should help you salvage a half decent selfie in darkness.  The Honor 10 Lite is backed by Huawei’s in-house Kirin 710 processor which works alongside 4GB of RAM and 64GB of user-expandable storage. During my time with the device, I seldom ran into stutters while navigating through the UI. Apps opened swiftly and despite shipping with just 4GB of RAM, multitasking was buttery smooth too, as the device managed to keep half a dozen apps in memory at any given moment.  That said, playing intensive titles like PUBG isn’t a very smooth experience on the Honor 10 Lite. While the smartphone comfortably managed to run the game on medium graphics setting, there were noticeable frame drops during the heat of a battle. On the flip side, casual games like Dead Warfare, PAKO Forever, and Go Plane worked flawlessly on the device.  On a related note, the smartphone’s software doesn’t play well with certain games and applications. For instance, in PUBG, a good chunk of the device’s display was blacked out. While you can force the smartphone to run games in full-screen mode, it might lead to app crashes and display errors.     The Honor 10 Lite is fuelled by a 3,400mAh battery which lasted a full day on moderate usage. However, I found myself reaching for the charger whenever I pushed the smartphone too hard. In our battery test, the smartphone drained completely in 13 hours, which is a decent result, but I expected more out of the handset’s 3,400mAh cell.    Coming to the software, the Honor 10 Lite boots Android Pie with a custom skin of EMUI v9 on top. If you’re not a fan of third-party skins, then EMUI will do little to change your opinion. It’s quite a way from stock Android and comes riddled with a bunch of bloatware and Honor’s own applications, most of which cannot be uninstalled. On the bright side, you do get some nifty features with the skin, such as the ability to mute incoming notifications by flipping the device and a full-fledged theme store to satiate all your customisation cravings. The Honor 10 Lite is expected to be priced between Rs 13K to Rs 14K, which pits the device against smartphones like the Realme U1 (review), the Realme 2 Pro (review), the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2 (review) and the Xiaomi Mi A2. While the Honor 10 Lite has a lot going for it, including a good-looking design and dependable performance, it does little to stand out from the herd of other compelling choices. That said, my verdict could change if the smartphone is priced more competitively.   I’ll make sure to update this review when the device launches and we get to know it’s exact pricing.

2256,30,32288,3,5,2018-06-21,,32288,Shekhar Thakran -,Honor 7C review: a promising smartphone that stumbles before reaching the finishing line,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/honor-7c-review?pid=32288," “The Honor 7C promises on many fronts but consistency issues make it hard to recommend”Honor unveiled its 7C and 7A smartphones (first impressions) in India last month and the budget segment offerings come to the market in the midst of strong competition from other brands like Xiaomi and Realme. The more powerful out of the two new handsets, the Honor 7C has been launched by the company in two RAM variants, i.e. 3GB RAM and 4GB RAM, which are priced at Rs 9,999 and Rs 11,999, respectively. To help you figure out whether the Honor 7C offers value for your hard-earned bucks, we’ve reviewed the new handset in detail. Coming to the aesthetics first, the Honor 7C ships with a rather premium design for its price and notably looks identical to the Honor 7A. The handset sports a metal backplate with plastic strips at the top and bottom. The 7C will most likely survive accidental drops and doesn’t look like a phone that is priced below Rs 10,000. The smartphone feels sturdy as well as premium in hand and is easy to hold. The rear-mounted fingerprint sensor has been placed in the middle and is easily accessible. The security sensor works fast as advertised and is accurate too.The dual camera module, accompanied by an LED flash, has been placed on the top-left at the rear. The volume rocker as well as the power keys have been placed on the right of the handset and are easy to reach, even while using the phone with one hand. The loudspeaker grille as well as the micro-USB charging port, alongside the 3.5mm audio jack, are all placed at the bottom of the handset. The SIM slot is on the left of the handset and the tray comes with a dedicated slot for a microSD card along with dual SIM slots. Swiftly moving to the details about the display, the Honor 7C packs a 5.99-inch HD+ (1,440 x 720 pixels) “FullView” IPS LCD panel at the front with an 18:9 aspect ratio. The narrow bezels at the front are in line with the recent industry trend and prevent the handset from looking dated. The viewing angles on the phone are good the maximum brightness reaches a level that makes it easy to use even in outdoor conditions. If we talk about quality, the colours are punchy and come across as slightly oversaturated. However, the overall screen quality is decent and narrow bezels work towards improving the multimedia viewing experience with the phone. As you might expect with the screen size and resolution, the low pixel density is a drawback but shouldn’t be a big issue for most users in everyday scenarios. You can have a closer look at the design with our design gallery embedded below:
Jumping into the optics, the rear-facing dual camera module on the Honor 7C features a primary 13MP sensor, accompanied by a 2MP secondary sensor and an LED flash. At front, we have an 8MP sensor, with f/2.0 aperture, to click selfies and for video calling. Without beating around the bush, the camera performance offered by the Honor 7C is slightly inconsistent. While the handset manages to capture some really good pictures given apt lighting conditions, in low light and in night conditions, the smartphone fails to recreate the same quality. Images clicked in poor lighting conditions have considerable noise and turn out to be grainy most of the times. The secondary sensor allows the smartphone to capture images with depth effect, which essentially blurs out the background. The images clicked with depth effect turned out to be especially impressive for us.  There are beauty and wide-aperture modes, available right up front on the default camera app. Users get to adjust the background blur even after clicking the pictures. However, some images turned completely green while adjusting the background blur during our testing and never returned to their original state. If you captured a memorable moment and the image got ruined due to this issue, you are bound to be disappointed. Having said that, on certain occasions, the adjustment worked just fine. The company would hopefully roll out the fix for this issue via a software update soon.There are other usual options available like HDR, Panorama, Watermark etc. The default camera app allows users to download and add options like “Good food” for rich colours and “Document scan” for rectangular correction.  Now that we are done with the primary camera setup, let’s move on to the secondary snapper. The 7C packs an 8-megapixel selfie camera. The default camera app doesn’t offer too many options for the selfie camera and unfortunately, the pictures taken from the front camera were average. As we have seen over the years, the higher megapixel count doesn’t necessarily translate into good image quality. This holds true for the front camera performance offered by the Honor 7C. Some of the other handsets in budget price range offer a much better performance in this department.
The Honor 7C is powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 450 processor clocked at 1.8GHz, coupled with Adreno 506 GPU. The unit available with us packed 4GB of RAM, but there is a 3GB RAM variant available at a lower price. In terms of performance, just like the cameras, the 7C is hit-and-miss. The handset manages to breeze past even some of the more demanding apps at times but could then be found struggling with others. Multitasking presented the same consistency issues for us. There were few app crashes but at other times, the 7C performed exceptionally well too. The smartphone runs Android 8.0 Oreo-based EMUI 8.0 out of the box and as you might expect from an Honor handset, comes with some nifty features on top. You get a one-hand mode, Game Suite for configuring system settings for multiple games, and a Ride mode, among other options. The Ride mode essentially disables Bluetooth and provide users with the option to just access the dialler and emergency callsOther notable features include dual Bluetooth and real-time audio monitoring. The former allows users to connect the smartphone with two devices simultaneously, while the latter allows you to listen to your own voice, via earbuds, while recording audio. Needless to say, dual Bluetooth brings along utility and definitely proves to be a useful feature but realtime audio-monitoring comes across as mostly a gimmick.Apart from the fingerprint sensor, much like some of the other recent smartphones, the Honor 7C comes with face unlock for security. The face unlock feature is really fast but not as secure. For example, we managed to unlock the handset with half our face covered as well.The handset comes with 32GB of built-in storage, which is expandable via a microSD card up to 256GB. Considering how most of us use our smartphones as our multimedia consumption devices, the expandable storage aspect definitely comes across as a huge positive. The new budget smartphone from Honor packs in a 3,000mAh battery. The company claims that the smartphone’s battery has been designed for longevity and retains more than 80 percent of its capacity even after 500 full recharges. As there are many options priced below Rs 10,000 that offer larger battery sizes, this claim might be able to woo some customers to the handset. If we talk about real-day usage, the handset did not manage to last a full day for us and had to be recharged before the end of the day. However, it needs to be clarified that our usage was reasonably heavy, so the same result might not hold true for casual phone users. In our video loop test, where we run an HD video on loop with half the maximum brightness and half the maximum sound on the loudspeaker, the Honor 7C managed to last around 10 hours. This means that the battery life might not be the best aspect of this particular handset from Honor.  Unfortunately, the Honor 7C cannot be described as a standout performer in any of the main features that one looks for before buying a smartphone. The handset does tick many boxes as a value-for-money device, but stops short of delivering due to consistency issues. If we talk about the competitors, the Realme 1 (review) and Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 (review) hold an upper hand over the 7C with better processing and camera performance. However, the brand seems to be on right path and if this continues, we might soon see a compelling entry from Honor in the VFM segment.   Photos by Raj Rout"

Jumping into the optics, the rear-facing dual camera module on the Honor 7C features a primary 13MP sensor, accompanied by a 2MP secondary sensor and an LED flash. At front, we have an 8MP sensor, with f/2.0 aperture, to click selfies and for video calling. Without beating around the bush, the camera performance offered by the Honor 7C is slightly inconsistent. While the handset manages to capture some really good pictures given apt lighting conditions, in low light and in night conditions, the smartphone fails to recreate the same quality. Images clicked in poor lighting conditions have considerable noise and turn out to be grainy most of the times. The secondary sensor allows the smartphone to capture images with depth effect, which essentially blurs out the background. The images clicked with depth effect turned out to be especially impressive for us.  There are beauty and wide-aperture modes, available right up front on the default camera app. Users get to adjust the background blur even after clicking the pictures. However, some images turned completely green while adjusting the background blur during our testing and never returned to their original state. If you captured a memorable moment and the image got ruined due to this issue, you are bound to be disappointed. Having said that, on certain occasions, the adjustment worked just fine. The company would hopefully roll out the fix for this issue via a software update soon.There are other usual options available like HDR, Panorama, Watermark etc. The default camera app allows users to download and add options like “Good food” for rich colours and “Document scan” for rectangular correction.  Now that we are done with the primary camera setup, let’s move on to the secondary snapper. The 7C packs an 8-megapixel selfie camera. The default camera app doesn’t offer too many options for the selfie camera and unfortunately, the pictures taken from the front camera were average. As we have seen over the years, the higher megapixel count doesn’t necessarily translate into good image quality. This holds true for the front camera performance offered by the Honor 7C. Some of the other handsets in budget price range offer a much better performance in this department.
The Honor 7C is powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 450 processor clocked at 1.8GHz, coupled with Adreno 506 GPU. The unit available with us packed 4GB of RAM, but there is a 3GB RAM variant available at a lower price. In terms of performance, just like the cameras, the 7C is hit-and-miss. The handset manages to breeze past even some of the more demanding apps at times but could then be found struggling with others. Multitasking presented the same consistency issues for us. There were few app crashes but at other times, the 7C performed exceptionally well too. The smartphone runs Android 8.0 Oreo-based EMUI 8.0 out of the box and as you might expect from an Honor handset, comes with some nifty features on top. You get a one-hand mode, Game Suite for configuring system settings for multiple games, and a Ride mode, among other options. The Ride mode essentially disables Bluetooth and provide users with the option to just access the dialler and emergency callsOther notable features include dual Bluetooth and real-time audio monitoring. The former allows users to connect the smartphone with two devices simultaneously, while the latter allows you to listen to your own voice, via earbuds, while recording audio. Needless to say, dual Bluetooth brings along utility and definitely proves to be a useful feature but realtime audio-monitoring comes across as mostly a gimmick.Apart from the fingerprint sensor, much like some of the other recent smartphones, the Honor 7C comes with face unlock for security. The face unlock feature is really fast but not as secure. For example, we managed to unlock the handset with half our face covered as well.The handset comes with 32GB of built-in storage, which is expandable via a microSD card up to 256GB. Considering how most of us use our smartphones as our multimedia consumption devices, the expandable storage aspect definitely comes across as a huge positive. The new budget smartphone from Honor packs in a 3,000mAh battery. The company claims that the smartphone’s battery has been designed for longevity and retains more than 80 percent of its capacity even after 500 full recharges. As there are many options priced below Rs 10,000 that offer larger battery sizes, this claim might be able to woo some customers to the handset. If we talk about real-day usage, the handset did not manage to last a full day for us and had to be recharged before the end of the day. However, it needs to be clarified that our usage was reasonably heavy, so the same result might not hold true for casual phone users. In our video loop test, where we run an HD video on loop with half the maximum brightness and half the maximum sound on the loudspeaker, the Honor 7C managed to last around 10 hours. This means that the battery life might not be the best aspect of this particular handset from Honor.  Unfortunately, the Honor 7C cannot be described as a standout performer in any of the main features that one looks for before buying a smartphone. The handset does tick many boxes as a value-for-money device, but stops short of delivering due to consistency issues. If we talk about the competitors, the Realme 1 (review) and Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 (review) hold an upper hand over the 7C with better processing and camera performance. However, the brand seems to be on right path and if this continues, we might soon see a compelling entry from Honor in the VFM segment.   Photos by Raj Rout"

The more powerful out of the two new handsets, the Honor 7C has been launched by the company in two RAM variants, i.e. 3GB RAM and 4GB RAM, which are priced at Rs 9,999 and Rs 11,999, respectively. To help you figure out whether the Honor 7C offers value for your hard-earned bucks, we’ve reviewed the new handset in detail. Coming to the aesthetics first, the Honor 7C ships with a rather premium design for its price and notably looks identical to the Honor 7A. The handset sports a metal backplate with plastic strips at the top and bottom. The 7C will most likely survive accidental drops and doesn’t look like a phone that is priced below Rs 10,000. The smartphone feels sturdy as well as premium in hand and is easy to hold. The rear-mounted fingerprint sensor has been placed in the middle and is easily accessible. The security sensor works fast as advertised and is accurate too.The dual camera module, accompanied by an LED flash, has been placed on the top-left at the rear. The volume rocker as well as the power keys have been placed on the right of the handset and are easy to reach, even while using the phone with one hand. The loudspeaker grille as well as the micro-USB charging port, alongside the 3.5mm audio jack, are all placed at the bottom of the handset. The SIM slot is on the left of the handset and the tray comes with a dedicated slot for a microSD card along with dual SIM slots. Swiftly moving to the details about the display, the Honor 7C packs a 5.99-inch HD+ (1,440 x 720 pixels) “FullView” IPS LCD panel at the front with an 18:9 aspect ratio. The narrow bezels at the front are in line with the recent industry trend and prevent the handset from looking dated. The viewing angles on the phone are good the maximum brightness reaches a level that makes it easy to use even in outdoor conditions. If we talk about quality, the colours are punchy and come across as slightly oversaturated. However, the overall screen quality is decent and narrow bezels work towards improving the multimedia viewing experience with the phone.

2212,30,31534,4,5,2017-12-05,,31534,Ketaki Bhojnagarwala -,"Honor 7X review: a stylish, VFM mid-ranger",https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/honor-7x-review?pid=31534," Bezel-less displays have been a major trend among smartphone flagships in 2017, but as we come to the end of the year, we’ve seen this feature trickle down to the mid-range as well. Honor has already launched the 9i (review) this year, a sub-Rs 20,000 smartphone packing an 18:9 display and quad-cameras. Now the brand is setting its sights on the even more lucrative sub-Rs 15,000 segment with the Honor 7X. The successor to the Honor 6X (review) carries forward the dual cameras at the rear, and adds in upgraded internals and an 18:9 display. I’ve spent a couple of weeks with the handset, and here’s what you need to know.Compared to the Honor 6X, the 7X is a design upgrade in every way. It’s super sleek, with an all-metal body and 2.5D curved glass for the display. The screen measures 5.93-inches in size, but it’s hard to tell thanks to the 18:9 aspect ratio, which results in bezels that are shrunk on all four sides. It feels like a 5.5-inch form factor, and the 7.6mm slimness of the chassis makes it pretty comfortable too for one-handed usage too. With full HD+ resolution (2,160 x 1,080 pixels), the screen is sharp with punchy colours, although it’s highly reflective. I did find the auto brightness to be a bit iffy as well, often dimming the screen to a point that I’d have to manually increase 
While the 7X’s metal build feels super premium, it’s also very slippery, and I would recommend you slap a case on immediately. The dual cameras at the rear protrude as well, so the case should also help level them with the rest of the rear panel. There’s a fingerprint sensor at the back, since you get only onscreen navigation controls on the 7X. It’s incredibly fast and accurate, and one of the best I’ve seen in this price segment. Thankfully, you do get a 3.5mm audio jack on the device, although Honor has decided to retain micro-USB instead of Type-C. The Honor 7X comes in blue, black and gold finishes, so there’s plenty of choice to go around The Honor 7X features a 16MP camera at the rear, an upgrade over the 6X’s 12MP shooter. The secondary depth sensor remains the same at 2MP. The dual camera module enables the 7X to take bokeh shots, letting you adjust the aperture between f/0.95 and f/16. You can also adjust the aperture in edits, and change the focus point as well. The camera can take nice depth of field images in daylight, although there is artificial softening around the edges of the subjects, especially if you choose a very wide aperture. The camera app also features a Portrait mode, which offers a similar bokeh effects for portrait shots alongside beautification effects. The camera can capture decent macro and daylight images, but in anything less than bright sunlight, you can expect a significant amount of grain. Photos taken indoors displayed high levels of noise even during the day, and night time shots lack detail. The front 8MP camera offers a Portrait mode as well, although it’s software based since there’s only a single sensor. 
The 7X runs Android 7.1 out of the box, with Huawei’s custom EMUI 5.1 interface on top. The brand doesn’t have the greatest track record when it comes to providing software updates, although we expect it to roll out Android Oreo for the 7X at the very least. is one of the better custom interfaces out there, and its been polished significantly over the years. What I don’t like is the presence of bloatware on the phone – these include both third-party apps and Huawei’s own app suite. Thankfully, you can uninstall the former.  EMUI 5.1 brings the usual tweaks, including the ability to add multiple functions to the fingerprint sensor, enable a simple home screen interface, change the navigation key layout and use an app twin feature for social media apps like Facebook, Snapchat and WhatsApp. You can also enable a one-handed UI and various gestures.  Like the Honor 9i, the 7X is powered by the Kirin 659 SoC, paired with 4GB of RAM. There are 32GB and 64GB storage options to choose from, and both feature microSD card slots for expansion. Unfortunately, the 7X ships with a hybrid dual-SIM slot, so you’ll have to forego one of the SIMs if you want to increase the storage. Despite the heavy EMUI skin, I found the 7X to be fast and responsive in daily usage. Gaming on the smartphone doesn’t cause it to heat up too much, and apart from a few frame drops, is fine for more graphics heavy games. The 18:9 display isn’t optimised for many apps and games though, so in many cases you’ll see a black band at the bottom of the screen. There is an option to enable a full screen mode for incompatible apps, but this stretches the display and warps the view in some cases.  The 7X is fuelled by an ample 3,340mAh battery, which comfortably offers a day’s juice. In our battery drain test, the phone lasted for eight hours and 53 minutes, but real life usage tells a different story. I usually had about 20 percent battery left at the end of the day, with usage involving phone calls, photos, WhatsApp and social media. Unfortunately, phone doesn’t support fast charging, and took two hours and 33 minutes to go from 0 to 100 percent using the bundled charger in our test.   It’s been a while since Honor released a competitively priced budget device in India. The 7X brings some much needed variety to the sub-Rs 15,000 segment, which has so far been dominated by the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (review), Moto G5s Plus (review) and even the recently announced Xiaomi Mi A1 (review). While the last two also offer dual cameras, they have the added benefit of a stock Android interface with a promise of timely updates. On the other hand, the Honor 7X features an 18:9 screen which results in a bigger display inside a smaller form factor. It also offers a larger battery, which is useful. Which handset you ultimately choose as your daily driver depends on the features you value, but that said, the Honor 7X should prove to be a worthy choice. "

Despite the heavy EMUI skin, I found the 7X to be fast and responsive in daily usage. Gaming on the smartphone doesn’t cause it to heat up too much, and apart from a few frame drops, is fine for more graphics heavy games. The 18:9 display isn’t optimised for many apps and games though, so in many cases you’ll see a black band at the bottom of the screen. There is an option to enable a full screen mode for incompatible apps, but this stretches the display and warps the view in some cases.  The 7X is fuelled by an ample 3,340mAh battery, which comfortably offers a day’s juice. In our battery drain test, the phone lasted for eight hours and 53 minutes, but real life usage tells a different story. I usually had about 20 percent battery left at the end of the day, with usage involving phone calls, photos, WhatsApp and social media. Unfortunately, phone doesn’t support fast charging, and took two hours and 33 minutes to go from 0 to 100 percent using the bundled charger in our test.   It’s been a while since Honor released a competitively priced budget device in India. The 7X brings some much needed variety to the sub-Rs 15,000 segment, which has so far been dominated by the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (review), Moto G5s Plus (review) and even the recently announced Xiaomi Mi A1 (review). While the last two also offer dual cameras, they have the added benefit of a stock Android interface with a promise of timely updates. On the other hand, the Honor 7X features an 18:9 screen which results in a bigger display inside a smaller form factor. It also offers a larger battery, which is useful. Which handset you ultimately choose as your daily driver depends on the features you value, but that said, the Honor 7X should prove to be a worthy choice. "
2212,30,31534,4,5,2017-12-05,,31534,Ketaki Bhojnagarwala -,"Honor 7X review: a stylish, VFM mid-ranger",https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/honor-7x-review?pid=31534," Bezel-less displays have been a major trend among smartphone flagships in 2017, but as we come to the end of the year, we’ve seen this feature trickle down to the mid-range as well. Honor has already launched the 9i (review) this year, a sub-Rs 20,000 smartphone packing an 18:9 display and quad-cameras. Now the brand is setting its sights on the even more lucrative sub-Rs 15,000 segment with the Honor 7X. The successor to the Honor 6X (review) carries forward the dual cameras at the rear, and adds in upgraded internals and an 18:9 display. I’ve spent a couple of weeks with the handset, and here’s what you need to know.Compared to the Honor 6X, the 7X is a design upgrade in every way. It’s super sleek, with an all-metal body and 2.5D curved glass for the display. The screen measures 5.93-inches in size, but it’s hard to tell thanks to the 18:9 aspect ratio, which results in bezels that are shrunk on all four sides. It feels like a 5.5-inch form factor, and the 7.6mm slimness of the chassis makes it pretty comfortable too for one-handed usage too. With full HD+ resolution (2,160 x 1,080 pixels), the screen is sharp with punchy colours, although it’s highly reflective. I did find the auto brightness to be a bit iffy as well, often dimming the screen to a point that I’d have to manually increase 
While the 7X’s metal build feels super premium, it’s also very slippery, and I would recommend you slap a case on immediately. The dual cameras at the rear protrude as well, so the case should also help level them with the rest of the rear panel. There’s a fingerprint sensor at the back, since you get only onscreen navigation controls on the 7X. It’s incredibly fast and accurate, and one of the best I’ve seen in this price segment. Thankfully, you do get a 3.5mm audio jack on the device, although Honor has decided to retain micro-USB instead of Type-C. The Honor 7X comes in blue, black and gold finishes, so there’s plenty of choice to go around The Honor 7X features a 16MP camera at the rear, an upgrade over the 6X’s 12MP shooter. The secondary depth sensor remains the same at 2MP. The dual camera module enables the 7X to take bokeh shots, letting you adjust the aperture between f/0.95 and f/16. You can also adjust the aperture in edits, and change the focus point as well. The camera can take nice depth of field images in daylight, although there is artificial softening around the edges of the subjects, especially if you choose a very wide aperture. The camera app also features a Portrait mode, which offers a similar bokeh effects for portrait shots alongside beautification effects. The camera can capture decent macro and daylight images, but in anything less than bright sunlight, you can expect a significant amount of grain. Photos taken indoors displayed high levels of noise even during the day, and night time shots lack detail. The front 8MP camera offers a Portrait mode as well, although it’s software based since there’s only a single sensor. 
The 7X runs Android 7.1 out of the box, with Huawei’s custom EMUI 5.1 interface on top. The brand doesn’t have the greatest track record when it comes to providing software updates, although we expect it to roll out Android Oreo for the 7X at the very least. is one of the better custom interfaces out there, and its been polished significantly over the years. What I don’t like is the presence of bloatware on the phone – these include both third-party apps and Huawei’s own app suite. Thankfully, you can uninstall the former.  EMUI 5.1 brings the usual tweaks, including the ability to add multiple functions to the fingerprint sensor, enable a simple home screen interface, change the navigation key layout and use an app twin feature for social media apps like Facebook, Snapchat and WhatsApp. You can also enable a one-handed UI and various gestures.  Like the Honor 9i, the 7X is powered by the Kirin 659 SoC, paired with 4GB of RAM.

1965,30,30193,3.5,5,2017-06-14,,30193,Deepak Dhingra -,Honor 8 Lite review: a decent all-rounder that gets cannibalised by its sibling,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/honor-8-lite-review?pid=30193," “The Honor 8 Lite is a looker for sure, but is it worth a buy?”As the successor to one of the sexiest phones of 2016, the Honor 8 Lite has a lot riding on its slender shoulders. The older model we’re referring to is the gorgeous Honor 8 (review) of course, and that was a phone which was truly a beauty with brains. Apart from its stylish looks, it boasted a dual camera setup that proved to be extremely capable in terms of shooting capabilities. As a stripped-down version, the new Honor 8 Lite (first impressions) doesn’t have the same claim to fame however. And that makes us wonder if can really live up to the legacy of its predecessor. If you’re looking for the short answer, it’s yes. For starters, the phone carries on with the good looks one would expect from the Honor 8’s successor. Next, despite the lack of dual cameras, the photographic prowess of the Lite isn’t half bad, though it tends to miss the mark sometimes. The performance and battery life is quite decent too. As for the bad, well, we’d count the lack of fast charging among one of the gripes we have with it. Now that you have the lowdown on the phone in a nutshell, let’s take a slightly more detailed look. The combination of a compact 5.2-inch 2.5D display slapped on a sleek glass sandwich design gives the Honor 8 Lite a classy, elegant look. The primary camera at the rear sits flush with the body, and there are no unruly protrusions anywhere on its svelte bod. The phone probably won’t overshadow its accomplished predecessor in the design department, but suffice it to say that the 8 Lite is one of the best-looking phones south of Rs 20k. The fingerprint scanner is placed at the rear, and works quite well for recognising your prints and unlocking the phone in a jiffy. It even offers a few gestures – such as bringing down the notifications panel with a downward swipe, letting you browse through pictures in the gallery and so on.At the fascia, things remain minimalistic. The home and navigation keys are available as part of software, and thanks to that, you can customise the layout and sequence of the buttons as per your preferences. The full HD display is crisp and vibrant, but looks a tad washed out under sunlight. Maybe it’s just us, but the touchscreen doesn’t seem very responsive. Do note that unlike the Honor 8 which rocked a USB Type-C Port, the 8 Lite sticks to the older micro-USB interface for charging and data transfers.  As far as the shooting prowess is concerned, the Honor 8 Lite offers a bunch of modes, including pro, light painting, time lapse, slow-mo, document scan, watermark etc. A whole range of colour filters with live previews are in the offing too. The camera features object tracking, but 4K video is not part of its repertoire. The 12MP shooter captures good stills for the most part – daylight shots usually look very good and rich in detail, night shots with ambient lighting keep noise under control, and the HDR mode subtly improves your captures. Daylight shots sometimes come out slightly washed out though, and since there’s no OIS, you’ll have to have a steady hand to avoid blur while shooting after the sun goes down. The 8MP selfie snapper does a fair job of shooting selfies.
Software-wise, things remains as expected. Honor’s EMUI is on board, standing on the Android Nougat platform. As usual, there are a bunch of features, and customisation options. Despite all this, EMUI doesn’t come across as cluttered though.   There’s even a Flipboard-powered news aggregator that gets its own dedicated pane on the left of the main home screen. The features of note include the ability of enabling a dedicated app drawer if you prefer that instead of all apps being laid out on home screens, a simple mode, and a slew of battery saving Courtesy the octa-core Kirin 655 chip working in tandem with 4GB RAM, the performance is smooth for the most part, with a stutter or two cropping up on rare occasions. The phone keeps it cool when stressed too. You get about 50 gigs to use out of the built in 64GB storage… and the ability to add more via the hybrid slot. The 3,000mAh battery lasts the full working day with ease – our video loop test ran for about 15 hours before the phone ran out of juice. On the negative side though, there’s no fast charging, a feature which has quickly become the norm and is quite useful to have too. There’s no doubt that the Honor 8 Lite has a lot going in its favour, and comes across as stylish-looking, decent all rounder. Launched for a sticker price of Rs 17,999, the device is now available online in the region of Rs 15-16k. Unfortunately for it though, it fails to stand out in any single aspect, which means that some others in its segment, especially the Moto G5 Plus (review), come across as better buys. The G5 Plus shines with its superb camera, not to mention its near-stock interface. More importantly though, the dual-camera toting Honor 8 (review) is now available in the region of Rs 18-19k, making it a more compelling buy as compared to its Lite sibling."

2229,30,32063,,,2018-01-22,,32063,Prateek Pandey -,"Honor 9 Lite review: a stylish, feature-packed smartphone that doesn’t hurt the pocket",https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/honor-9-lite-review?pid=32063," “The Honor 9 Lite features similar specs as the 7X and the 9i smartphones, albeit costs significantly less” When I originally reviewed the 9i smartphone from Honor, I was amazed by how far the technology backing our smartphones has come in such a short span of time. At the time, the 9i was the first smartphone in the world to ship with four cameras two on the back and two on the front a feat which Honor achieved while keeping the price of the smartphone below Rs 20K. Since then, the company has been on a roll, launching two more smartphones in the form of the Honor 7X (review) and the Honor View 10 (review), both of which were well received by critics and fans alike.  Keeping the momentum going, the company recently announced the Honor 9 Lite (first impressions), an affordable smartphone which brings back the quad-camera setup of the 9i and adds a glass-back design to the mix. So, should you buy the Honor 9 Lite over the competition? Heck, should you buy it over Honor’s other affordable offerings, seeing how the 9 Lite is eerily similar to the 7X and the 9i in terms of specs? Having spent an extensive amount of time with the device, I think that you should. Here’s why. As I mentioned previously, the Honor 9 Lite draws parallels to its siblings in terms of most of its core specifications. Therefore, before I list everything new that the smartphone brings to the table, let me address the similarities between the 9 Lite and Honor’s other offerings namely the 7X and the 9i.  Starting off, the 9 Lite is powered by the same HiSilicon Kirin 659 processor which fuels the Honor 7X and 9i smartphones. Furthermore, the device also gets 4GB of RAM which works alongside 64GB of user-expandable storage. However, the smartphone ships with a hybrid SIM slot and therefore, you’ll have to compromise between expanding the storage or increasing your connectivity options with the 9 Lite. The experience of using the smartphone remains unchanged. The smartphone feels snappy during daily usage and while graphically-intensive games do take their toll on the device’s performance, the experience isn’t all that bad and apart from a few frame drops, you can run pretty much any game on the 9 Lite without much hassle. One thing you should be wary of is that the 9 Lite suffers from heating issues. While this did not result in CPU-throttling, the smartphone’s back gets extremely warm to the touch during usage, making it uncomfortable to hold the device.  Much like the Honor 9i, the Honor 9 Lite also ships with a quad-camera setup. While the front camera setup remains unchanged, the company has used a slightly different sensor for the primary camera of the 9 Lite, which now features a 13MP + 2MP combination in place of the 16MP + 2MP sensor as seen on the 9i. The front camera of the 9 Lite, on the other hand, retains the 13MP + 2MP combination of the 9i. With that said, the end result remains the same for the most part and shots clicked from either of the two smartphones capture decent details with good colour reproduction.
 Moreover, you also get the added advantage of clicking bokeh shots from both the front as well as the back cameras owing to the presence of depth-sensing sensors. Much to my dismay, the 9 Lite’s performance in low-light photography is average at best, and pictures clicked at night have considerable grain in them. On the flip side, if you love clicking selfies then you’ll enjoy using the feature-rich front camera setup of the 9 Lite, which captures some incredibly detailed portraits. The smartphone’s built-in beauty mode does a good job at colour-correcting the skin tone without making the selfies seem unnatural too, which is an added bonus. You’ll find the 9 Lite to draw parallels in the software department with the 7X and the 9i as well. While the handset boots Android Oreo out-of-the-box, the smartphone still runs a custom skin of EMUI on top which offers the same look and feel as the previous versions of the software. However, with the 9 Lite, you get the added advantage of having the latest security patches from Google. As far as some of the features are concerned, you’ll get a bunch of customisation options on the 9 Lite, along with the presence of some gestures and motion controls too. The handset also ships with a built-in app locker and therefore, you won’t have to download a third-party tool from the Play Store to secure your apps either. Lastly, unlike some other Chinese OEMs, Honor gives buyers the option of enabling an app drawer on the smartphone which reduces the clutter on the homescreenThe 9 Lite is, in more ways than one, a unique offering from Honor. While the smartphone shares the same innards as the 7X and the 9i, from the outside, the 9 Lite couldn’t be any more different. The handset has been constructed using a blend of metal and glass which paves way for a stunning design, though on the flip side, it does gather fingerprints and smudges. As far as the in-hand feel is concerned, I have to give props to Honor for designing one of the most ergonomic smartphones I’ve used till date. The 9 Lite nestles really well in the palms, thanks to the rounded finish of its metal trim and since the device employs glass instead of metal, the smartphone won’t weigh your hand down either.
 With that said, the 9 Lite is extremely slippery and presumably delicate, so I’ll advise you to slap a protective case on it the second you get it out of its box. For security, you will get a fingerprint sensor towards the back of the smartphone which in traditional Honor fashion, is extremely quick and accurate, so no complaints there.The display on the Honor 9 Lite packs in the same FHD+ resolution as the 9i and the 7X, but is a tad bit smaller at 5.65-inches. This, coupled with the smartphone’s bezel-less design paves way for excellent one-handed usage and you can easily reach the corners of the phone without much struggle. In terms of the overall display quality, you’ll find that the display on the 9 Lite has excellent viewing angles and vibrant colours which makes consuming media on the smartphone an immersive experience.The Honor 9 Lite is fuelled by a 3,000mAh battery which is smaller than the battery on both the 7X as well as the 9i. However, don’t let that fool you into thinking that the phone has poor battery life. During the course of my review period, the Honor 9 Lite comfortably saw me through the end of a day on heavy usage, which involved texting on Whatsapp, listening to music, playing some casual games and clicking a ton of selfies. The only downside of the battery on the 9 Lite is that it doesn’t come with support for fast charging and therefore, it takes a while to juice up.  Priced at Rs 10,999, the 3GB RAM variant of the Honor 9 Lite is an absolute steal, given that in this price bracket, no other option gives you an 18:9 display (a very capable one at that) and quad cameras.The latter shoot decent photos and the smartphone offers a solid battery life too. Also, the 9 Lite is the best-looking smartphone in the budget segment in my opinion, and the device should turn heads every time you take it out of your pocket. However, the 4GB RAM variant of the smartphone doesn’t seem as compelling, since it has been priced at Rs 14,999, which is a huge margin for a small bump in RAM and storage. Also, the 4GB RAM variant directly competes with some strong rivals, like the Xiaomi Mi A1 (review), which comes with more well-rounded specs but misses out on the bezel-less design, and Honor’s own 7X.In conclusion, if you have a budget of around Rs 12,000, then the base variant of the Honor 9 Lite is a great buy, as the smartphone will not disappoint you.

2229,30,32063,,,2018-01-22,,32063,Prateek Pandey -,"Honor 9 Lite review: a stylish, feature-packed smartphone that doesn’t hurt the pocket",https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/honor-9-lite-review?pid=32063," “The Honor 9 Lite features similar specs as the 7X and the 9i smartphones, albeit costs significantly less” When I originally reviewed the 9i smartphone from Honor, I was amazed by how far the technology backing our smartphones has come in such a short span of time. At the time, the 9i was the first smartphone in the world to ship with four cameras two on the back and two on the front a feat which Honor achieved while keeping the price of the smartphone below Rs 20K. Since then, the company has been on a roll, launching two more smartphones in the form of the Honor 7X (review) and the Honor View 10 (review), both of which were well received by critics and fans alike.  Keeping the momentum going, the company recently announced the Honor 9 Lite (first impressions), an affordable smartphone which brings back the quad-camera setup of the 9i and adds a glass-back design to the mix. So, should you buy the Honor 9 Lite over the competition? Heck, should you buy it over Honor’s other affordable offerings, seeing how the 9 Lite is eerily similar to the 7X and the 9i in terms of specs? Having spent an extensive amount of time with the device, I think that you should. Here’s why. As I mentioned previously, the Honor 9 Lite draws parallels to its siblings in terms of most of its core specifications. Therefore, before I list everything new that the smartphone brings to the table, let me address the similarities between the 9 Lite and Honor’s other offerings namely the 7X and the 9i.  Starting off, the 9 Lite is powered by the same HiSilicon Kirin 659 processor which fuels the Honor 7X and 9i smartphones. Furthermore, the device also gets 4GB of RAM which works alongside 64GB of user-expandable storage. However, the smartphone ships with a hybrid SIM slot and therefore, you’ll have to compromise between expanding the storage or increasing your connectivity options with the 9 Lite. The experience of using the smartphone remains unchanged. The smartphone feels snappy during daily usage and while graphically-intensive games do take their toll on the device’s performance, the experience isn’t all that bad and apart from a few frame drops, you can run pretty much any game on the 9 Lite without much hassle. One thing you should be wary of is that the 9 Lite suffers from heating issues. While this did not result in CPU-throttling, the smartphone’s back gets extremely warm to the touch during usage, making it uncomfortable to hold the device.  Much like the Honor 9i, the Honor 9 Lite also ships with a quad-camera setup. While the front camera setup remains unchanged, the company has used a slightly different sensor for the primary camera of the 9 Lite, which now features a 13MP + 2MP combination in place of the 16MP + 2MP sensor as seen on the 9i. The front camera of the 9 Lite, on the other hand, retains the 13MP + 2MP combination of the 9i. With that said, the end result remains the same for the most part and shots clicked from either of the two smartphones capture decent details with good colour reproduction.
 Moreover, you also get the added advantage of clicking bokeh shots from both the front as well as the back cameras owing to the presence of depth-sensing sensors. Much to my dismay, the 9 Lite’s performance in low-light photography is average at best, and pictures clicked at night have considerable grain in them. On the flip side, if you love clicking selfies then you’ll enjoy using the feature-rich front camera setup of the 9 Lite, which captures some incredibly detailed portraits. The smartphone’s built-in beauty mode does a good job at colour-correcting the skin tone without making the selfies seem unnatural too, which is an added bonus. You’ll find the 9 Lite to draw parallels in the software department with the 7X and the 9i as well. While the handset boots Android Oreo out-of-the-box, the smartphone still runs a custom skin of EMUI on top which offers the same look and feel as the previous versions of the software. However, with the 9 Lite, you get the added advantage of having the latest security patches from Google. As far as some of the features are concerned, you’ll get a bunch of customisation options on the 9 Lite, along with the presence of some gestures and motion controls too. The handset also ships with a built-in app locker and therefore, you won’t have to download a third-party tool from the Play Store to secure your apps either. Lastly, unlike some other Chinese OEMs, Honor gives buyers the option of enabling an app drawer on the smartphone which reduces the clutter on the homescreenThe 9 Lite is, in more ways than one, a unique offering from Honor. While the smartphone shares the same innards as the 7X and the 9i, from the outside, the 9 Lite couldn’t be any more different. The handset has been constructed using a blend of metal and glass which paves way for a stunning design, though on the flip side, it does gather fingerprints and smudges. As far as the in-hand feel is concerned, I have to give props to Honor for designing one of the most ergonomic smartphones I’ve used till date. The 9 Lite nestles really well in the palms, thanks to the rounded finish of its metal trim and since the device employs glass instead of metal, the smartphone won’t weigh your hand down either.
 With that said, the 9 Lite is extremely slippery and presumably delicate, so I’ll advise you to slap a protective case on it the second you get it out of its box. For security, you will get a fingerprint sensor towards the back of the smartphone which in traditional Honor fashion, is extremely quick and accurate, so no complaints there.The display on the Honor 9 Lite packs in the same FHD+ resolution as the 9i and the 7X, but is a tad bit smaller at 5.65-inches. This, coupled with the smartphone’s bezel-less design paves way for excellent one-handed usage and you can easily reach the corners of the phone without much struggle. In terms of the overall display quality, you’ll find that the display on the 9 Lite has excellent viewing angles and vibrant colours which makes consuming media on the smartphone an immersive experience.The Honor 9 Lite is fuelled by a 3,000mAh battery which is smaller than the battery on both the 7X as well as the 9i. However, don’t let that fool you into thinking that the phone has poor battery life. During the course of my review period, the Honor 9 Lite comfortably saw me through the end of a day on heavy usage, which involved texting on Whatsapp, listening to music, playing some casual games and clicking a ton of selfies. The only downside of the battery on the 9 Lite is that it doesn’t come with support for fast charging and therefore, it takes a while to juice up.  Priced at Rs 10,999, the 3GB RAM variant of the Honor 9 Lite is an absolute steal, given that in this price bracket, no other option gives you an 18:9 display (a very capable one at that) and quad cameras.The latter shoot decent photos and the smartphone offers a solid battery life too.

2229,30,31548,,,2017-10-23,,31548,Prateek Pandey -,Honor 9i review: the all-screen fascia and four cameras make it a compelling proposition,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/honor-9i-review?pid=31548," “The Honor 9i is the world’s first smartphone to ship with four cameras” Just when we thought that smartphone manufacturers have run out of party tricks to surprise us, out came Honor with the 9i (first impressions) – a smartphone which ships with this year’s bezel-less screen design trend and adds a dual-camera setup on both the back as well as the front to the mix. What’s even better is that the smartphone isn’t a high-end flagship, but a reasonably priced mid-ranger. On paper, the 9i is too enticing to refuse, but is it all talk, no trousers? Stay with me to find out.  Bezel-less designs on smartphones don’t really raise eybrows anymore and we’ve already seen plenty of devices ship with minimal bezels. However, smartphone manufacturers often cut corners with the display’s resolution to reduce costs. To Honor’s credit, the 9i looks and feels amazing and the 5.9-inch FHD+ display is nothing short of stunning. But before we jump into my experience with the display, allow me to talk a little more about the handset’s design. As I mentioned earlier, the Honor 9i packs a massive 5.9-inch display, but don’t let that fool you into thinking that the smartphone is a phablet. On the contrary, the smartphone’s size is comparable to most 5.5-inchers in the market, a feat made possible by trimming down the top and the bottom bezels and adopting the 18:9 aspect ratio. The build quality of the Honor 9i is impeccable too, which is evident the second you pick up the smartphone. The 9i employs metal in its construction and has been crafted with industrial precision. The device flaunts a curvy back which makes it comfortable to hold and the sides merge into the display seamlessly as well.
Now on to the things I disliked about the handset’s design. Despite its slim bezels, the Honor 9i isn’t ideal for one-handed usage. The smartphone is slippery and I almost dropped it while trying to reach for the notification panel. In the company’s defence, there are some software tweaks which will help you navigate your way around better on the 9i which I’ll talk more about in the software section. Furthermore, the smartphone’s rear camera protrudes outwards, which feels intrusive to the otherwise seamless design. With that said, the camera bump doesn’t make the smartphone wobble when placed flat on a table and therefore, it shouldn’t be a deal-breaker for most. There’s a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor which has been positioned really well and works great. The sensor is snappy and accurate, though I noticed that there was a minor delay between the sensor registering my fingerprint and the screen unlockingAs I mentioned before, the Honor 9i packs a 5.9-inch FHD+ display which gives the smartphone a screen resolution of 1,080 x 2,160 pixels. Thanks to its near bezel-less design, consuming media on the 9i is an incredible experience. The texts and images appear crisp and the slim bezels mean that you spend more time looking at the panel and not the borders. The colour reproduction is a bit off, but the viewing angles are great. The only downside of the display panel is that it doesn’t get too bright and therefore, you’ll have to squint your eyes under broad daylight.  Smartphone photography has advanced exponentially in terms of quality over the years. With sharper lenses, smartphones have been able to click brilliant stills in diverse scenarios. One of the biggest trends which was seen last year was that of portrait (or bokeh) shots which blurred the background of a subject to add more depth to the image. Now, to simulate depth, a smartphone was required to ship with two cameras at the back. While it’s certainly not a pre-requisite and a single camera could click in portrait mode via some software tweaks, the mode was primarily limited to devices which shipped with a dual-camera setup at the back. Well, the Honor 9i comes with not two, but four cameras. That’s right, the smartphone gets a dual-camera setup on both the front as well as the back, paving way for bokeh selfies as well as stills. In terms of specifications, the smartphone gets a pair of 16MP and 2MP sensors at the back. For selfies, you’ll be smiling into a pair of 13MP and 2MP sensors – so far, so good. But do the specs translate well into the day-to-day performance as well? Before we dissect the smartphone’s camera prowess, let’s take a closer look at the camera UI Despite running a custom skin, the camera UI of the Honor 9i is fairly minimalistic. Once you load up the camera app, you’ll be greeted with the shutter button at the bottom flanked by a quick-access toggle to access the gallery on the left, and a toggle to switch to video mode on the right. Up top, you’ll get the controls for the flash, live picture mode (which captures moments prior to clicking the shutter button and can be accessed via a long press on the image) along with a portrait mode. You can swipe right on the viewfinder to access more shooting modes such as HDR, a pro photo mode as well as night shot.  Now, as far as the overall camera performance is concerned, I must say, Honor did a fine job with the 9i. The daylight performance is outstanding in the segment and the camera manages to capture a good amount of details in broad daylight. The colour reproduction is a bit off, however, the images are pleasing to the eye. The built-in HDR mode does a decent job of bringing out details from both, the dark as well as the bright spots of the image. The smartphone is capable of shooting really good macro shots too, and the shutter and focus speed of the 9i are blazing fast as well. The Bokeh mode works well, however, fails to differentiate the subject from the background at times, resulting in soft edges around the subject. Unfortunately, lowlight performance is nothing to write home about and even with the use of the included flash, the images turn out fairly noisy. 
 As far as the performance of the front-facing shooter is concerned, the camera will be able to crunch out some incredible images under well-lit scenarios. Since the smartphone ships with two cameras up front as well, you’ll be able to click selfies in Bokeh mode too. As you can see from the sample images I’ve posted, the camera manages to blur out the background in selfies exceptionally well, which is great. However, as was the case with the primary camera, the lowlight performance of the selfie-duo is not outstanding. That said, you won’t have to look for a well-lit spot at night if you want to click decent selfies as the smartphone also features a dedicated LED flash module for the front camera.   Much like Samsung and Apple, Honor also has its own processor line which the company calls HiSilicon Kirin chips. If you’re even remotely familiar with mobile benchmarking applications, then you might have noticed that Kirin processors often trail Qualcomm counterparts in terms of benchmark scores. The reason behind this is that the GPU onboard the Kirin SoCs often runs on lower GFlops when compared to an equivalent Qualcomm processor. With that said, I would like to state upfront that the Kirin processors are no slouch and there’s little-to-no difference in the day-to-day performance of comparable Qualcomm and HiSilicon chips. Moreover, since the hardware has been designed by Honor itself, it should gel well with the software and crunch out solid performance and battery life as well. But does it?  Underneath its metallic chassis, the Honor 9i is powered by a Kirin 659 octa-core processor which works with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. The chip is based on the big.Little architecture which couples power-saving (Little) cores with performance (big) cores to keep a balance between performance and battery efficiency. Tech jargon aside, the Honor 9i is solid performer but it’s not without faults. For starters, while the smartphone opens apps fairly quickly, the transition feels abrupt when you close the application or jump into another one. Moreover, I noticed a slight stutter while navigating through the UI as well, though it only occurred once or twice over the course of my review period. Other than that, I have no complaints with the Honor 9i’s day-to-day performance. Being the intensive user that I am, the smartphone was constantly on its toes, but still managed to juggle between all my social media applications with ease. Turn the page over to gaming and you’ll get a different result. While the smartphone is more than capable of playing casual games such as Clash Royale, graphically intensive titles like Asphalt 8 take a heavy toll on smartphone’s performance. So much so, that you will not get playable frame rates if you play the game on high settings, which could be a huge red flag if you consider yourself to be a hardcore mobile gamer. That said, the smartphone manages thermals really well, which can be accredited to the battery-efficient Kirin processor.    As far as the battery life of the smartphone is concerned, the 3,340mAh unit on the Honor 9i will easily last you a single day even if you’re pushing the smartphone to its limits. The only complaint I have here is that the smartphone is still utilising a microUSB port, which means that you’ll have to deal with slow charging and data-transfer speeds. Moreover, the device doesn’t support fast charging either, which is a huge downer considering the size of the battery.  The Honor 9i boots Android Nougat and runs the company’s EMUI skin on top. Personally, I am not a huge fan of brands telling me how Android should look and feel. However, the custom skin onboard the 9i does come with a bunch of interesting features which betters the overall user experience. For starters, you can use the fingerprint sensor to perform a myriad of tasks besides just unlocking your smartphone. One of the gestures I used the most was swiping down to bring up the notifications pane. As I mentioned previously, the 9i isn’t one-hand friendly and therefore, having the option to swipe down on the fingerprint sensor rather than awkwardly reaching the top with your fingers to pull down the notification’s tab is a godsend. You’ll get some other frills attached to a custom skin as well, such as an app-cloning mode, which will allow you to run two instances of applications like WhatsApp or Facebook simultaneously. With that said, the Honor 9i ships with a ton of bloatware, most of which cannot be uninstalled and therefore, you’ll have less storage from the get-go when compared to say, a smartphone running stock Android.  Poor execution and lackluster efforts often overshadow good ideas. While we’ve already seen plenty of smartphones both, in the affordable as well as the high-end parade the bezel-less design, only a handful of manufacturers have been able to execute the design with spit and polish. Moreover, despite featuring four cameras and a near-bezel less display, the Honor 9i has been aggressively priced at Rs 17,999, the reason being that the affordable segment is one of the most competitive segments in the Indian market. Now, the Honor 9i isn’t the fastest smartphone in this segment and if you crave stock Android more than anything than you should probably stick to the Moto G5s Plus (review) or the Xiaomi Mi A1 (review). However, if you want a taste of the 18:9 aspect ratio without going bankrupt and don’t want to compromise on the display’s quality, then the Honor 9i is probably your best bet. Credit where credit’s due, Honor has managed to cut costs without cutting corners and for that reason, the 9i is a good device, provided you don’t game too much.  "
2282,30,32800,,,2018-08-07,,32800,Shekhar Thakran -,Honor 9N review: a mixed bag that deserves a second look,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/honor-9n-review?pid=32800," “The Honor 9N comes with a feature that allows users to turn the notch into a uniform bezel” Huawei sub-brand Honor has been on a roll this year. The brand has launched Honor 9 Lite (review), Honor 7X (review), Honor 7A (first impressions), Honor 7C (review), and the Honor 9N during the course of 2018. Notably, every new handset brought along a new feature or two, and primarily catered to a different audience altogether. The latest in the line, Honor 9N, has received a lot of attention since the smartphone’s launch last month for its affordable pricing and features. We have now spent enough time with the handset and are ready to share our detailed review.  The Honor 9N is one of the most affordable smartphones available with notch display design in the market right now. Interestingly, the new Honor handset also comes with a fingerprint sensor at the back, a feature missing on the OPPO A3s, which is the other affordable offering with a similar design. The 9N ships with a glass design at the back, which is definitely a fingerprint magnet but looks good nevertheless. The dual camera is placed in horizontal orientation on top-left and is assisted by an LED flash. Thankfully, Honor is among the few brands that can manage to pull off a dual camera module design without any noticeable bump at the back The volume rocker and power key are both placed on the right side with the micro-USB charging port and speaker grille at the bottom alongside the 3.5mm headphone jack. The microSD card slot is located on the left spine. There is an earpiece and front camera placed in the delightfully small notch above the display, and the thick bottom bezel comes with the Honor branding up front. While the design is still minimalistic, the brand name is present at the back side (in a bigger font) as well.  If we talk about the display, the Honor 9N packs a 5.84-inch FHD+ (2,280 x 1,080 pixels) IPS LCD panel with a taller-than-usual 19:9 aspect ratio. Although it seems to be the case with every other phone now, the maximum brightness level and the viewing angles are both fairly good with the Honor 9N as well. Considering the price range, the display quality offered by the 9N is extremely impressive. If you are planning to purchase the handset to consume multimedia content, you will likely not be disappointed. Surprisingly, we managed to scratch the phone’s display just by pulling it out of the pocket a few dozen times. This clearly shows that it would not be a bad idea to use a screen protector after buying the Honor 9N. Here’s a closer look at the design:
The 9N packs a dual-camera setup on the back with a 13-megapixel camera and a 2-megapixel secondary shooter. At the front, you are greeted by a 16-megapixel sensor. Using the default camera app with the rear camera, you get the option to enable wide aperture, portrait mode, and moving picture mode along with flash controls right up front. By swiping left, you get to the settings panel, where you can choose various options including GPS tag, image resolution, assistive grid, timer, audio control (allows you to click pictures by saying cheese or by analysing voice levels), and object tracking among others.By swiping to the right, you get access to various image modes including Night shot, Panorama, Light painting, Time-lapse, and Pro mode. In the pro mode, as you might expect, you can control aspects like white balance and ISO levels. With the front camera, you get to click selfies that can be “enhanced” with the AI-powered beauty mode, which allows you to choose from level 1 to level 10 in terms of enhancement. Coming to the real-life performance of the cameras on the Honor 9N, it came across as a hit-and-miss for us. There were some good shots taken in outdoor conditions with ample sunlight but some of the close-up shots, taken with wide aperture enabled, did not impress us at all. The edge detection turned out to be a notable issue and the lack of details did not help the case either. Again, the night shots lacked detail and turned out to be less than impressive, to say the least. Unfortunately, the same issues could be seen with the images taken by the front camera. 
The 9N runs Android 8.0 Oreo-based EMUI 8.0 out of the box. If you have used any other phone from Honor recently, the Honor 9N offers a similar experience. There are a few pre-installed apps including HiCare, Honor Club, Truecaller, and Netflix among others.For those who dislike the notch design, Honor has provided a setting that turns the notch into a uniform bezel. You can access this feature by heading to Settings > Display > Notch. You can also turn down the screen resolution to HD+ (1,520 x 720 pixels) in order to save power and extend battery life. The Colour mode allows users to choose between Default, Cold, and Warm options. The default setting can be manually adjusted to users liking as well.  For security, there is a face unlock feature that can be used as a substitute for the fingerprint sensor. In this particular department, Honor definitely deserves praise as the handset offers a fairly accurate, secure, and fast feature. While many other mid-range handsets can be unlocked even when the users’ eyes are closed or face is half covered, the 9N does not present any such issues. There is Game Suite to make sure the handset manages calls and notifications when you are busy gaming. The handset is powered by the company’s proprietary HiSilicon Kirin 659 SoC, coupled with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of built-in storage, which can be further expanded up to 256GB via a microSD card. If we talk about real-life usage, we would say that the handset managed to play light games and apps with ease but struggled with some graphically challenging games. For example, we managed to run PUBG in low graphics settings and the performance cannot be described as extremely impressive. Having said that, there were no stutter or lag issues while navigating within the UI and the animations remained smooth throughout the length of the review.The new budget segment offering from Honor houses a 3,000mAh battery. Just two years back, this would have classified as an impressive aspect about the handset but currently, there are many smartphones in the price range that offer better capacity. We had to recharge the Honor 9N by the end of the day with regular use. To provide further perspective, in our HD video loop test, the smartphone managed to last around 12 hours. In short, if you plan to head out on a trip with the Honor 9N, it would be a wise idea to carry along a power bank.  Considering that the Honor 9N is among the very few handsets in the budget segment that offer a notch design and provide an impressive display quality, the handset presents itself as a compelling option. However, the camera performance offered by the smartphone serves as a letdown and might be a dealbreaker for many. Some of the other handsets like the Realme 1 (review) and ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 (review) pose an incredible challenge with a comparatively better processors and performance in the same price range. As the 9N gets some of the small but important features (like the face unlock) right, there is some case to be made here, but the overall package would still depend largely on user preference. "

While many other mid-range handsets can be unlocked even when the users’ eyes are closed or face is half covered, the 9N does not present any such issues. There is Game Suite to make sure the handset manages calls and notifications when you are busy gaming. The handset is powered by the company’s proprietary HiSilicon Kirin 659 SoC, coupled with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of built-in storage, which can be further expanded up to 256GB via a microSD card. If we talk about real-life usage, we would say that the handset managed to play light games and apps with ease but struggled with some graphically challenging games. For example, we managed to run PUBG in low graphics settings and the performance cannot be described as extremely impressive. Having said that, there were no stutter or lag issues while navigating within the UI and the animations remained smooth throughout the length of the review.The new budget segment offering from Honor houses a 3,000mAh battery. Just two years back, this would have classified as an impressive aspect about the handset but currently, there are many smartphones in the price range that offer better capacity. We had to recharge the Honor 9N by the end of the day with regular use. To provide further perspective, in our HD video loop test, the smartphone managed to last around 12 hours. In short, if you plan to head out on a trip with the Honor 9N, it would be a wise idea to carry along a power bank.  Considering that the Honor 9N is among the very few handsets in the budget segment that offer a notch design and provide an impressive display quality, the handset presents itself as a compelling option. However, the camera performance offered by the smartphone serves as a letdown and might be a dealbreaker for many. Some of the other handsets like the Realme 1 (review) and ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 (review) pose an incredible challenge with a comparatively better processors and performance in the same price range. As the 9N gets some of the small but important features (like the face unlock) right, there is some case to be made here, but the overall package would still depend largely on user preference. "
1746,30,29022,3.5,5,2017-01-20,,29022,Nitansh Rastogi -,Lenovo K6 Note review: a marathon runner but lacks the killer instinct,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/lenovo-k6-note-review?pid=29022," The K series from Lenovo has worked wonders for the Chinese brand. The first smartphone in the range – the K3 Note (review) – was the most popular smartphone of 2015, while its successor, the Vibe K4 Note (review) sat at second place as the most popular phone of 2016. In fact, the company got so hopeful about the prospects of the series that it kept on adding successive devices in the range, in the form of the K5 Note (first impressions) and K6 Note. The latter was launched in December, and accompanies its compact and affordable sibling, the K6 Power (first impressions). With a price tag of Rs 13,999 (Rs 15,999 for the higher-end model), the Lenovo K6 Note might seem to be priced higher than the competition, but it still manages to stand out thanks to its offline availability. But is that enough to make it worth a buy? Well, that’s what we’ll be answering in our review.The K series has come of age. From the plastic-bodied K3 Note to the metal-clad K6 Note – the brand has continuously evolved the design language of the smartphones. The Lenovo K6 Note features a sturdy build thanks to its metal construction, while looks classy in grey. The best part is that even with a capacious battery of 4,000mAh, the phone doesn’t seem to be very thick at 8.4mm. Tipping the scales at 169g, its weight has been distributed well and it doesn’t feel too bulky in the hand. Having said that, the Lenovo K6 Note looks just like any other budget smartphone – a rectangular unibody metal slab with the usual placement of the ports and buttons. In fact, it simply is a bigger version of the K6 Power. The fascia is dominated by the 2.5D display panel, which is accompanied by a front-facing snapper and an earpiece above, and a row of capacitive keys at the bottom. Personally, we found the buttons to be an eyesore as they break the uniformity of the design. At the rear, the primary camera protrudes quite a bit, resulting in wobbliness whenever the K6 Note is kept on its back on a flat surface. It’s supplemented by a dual-colour LED flash and a fingerprint sensor. The biometric authentication works like a charm every time and responds quickly too.
The 5.5-inch IPS display bears a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels, which offers sharp visuals and striking colours. While the screen is a bit reflective, we didn’t find any issues in reading it in outdoor settings. Thanks to its Dolby ATMOS support, the Lenovo K6 Note is an ideal option for multimedia addicts as it offers a good sound output. It also supports Virtual Reality with its Theatermax 3.0 technology, and you can instantly switch to VR mode with a single click. Sadly though, it lacks any protective layer on top of the display panel.Just like its compact sibling, the Lenovo K6 Note is a battery-centric offering. It ensures that the phablet lasts more than a day, even with heavy usage. We used the device on Jio’s VoLTE network to access the internet, stream content off Amazon Prime Video and play games – and it still had a decent amount of juice left at the end of the day. That said, it’s not as remarkable as its rivals featuring similar battery packs. In our video loop test, it was able to play back an HD video at 50 percent brightness and volume levels for approximately 11 hours and 15 minutes – a couple of hours lower than the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (review). It also supports fast charging with the bundled 2A adapter… fuelling the battery from 0 to 100 in 2 hours 30 minutes. Like its sibling, you can also use it to reverse charge your mobile devices.  In terms of the connectivity, the Lenovo K6 Note doesn’t miss out on anything. From dual-SIM connectivity to Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth, and GPS – the phablet has them all. The hybrid SIM slot gives you the flexibility of extending the storage if you need, although the available 32 gigs of flash memory on board should be sufficient for most of your needs.   We’re glad we can count the the software aspect of the K6 Note as one of its plus points. While earlier, the brand was famous (read infamous) for its heavy customisations on top of Android with Vibe UI, complete with custom icons and a dozen preloaded apps, the Chinese company seems to be now following the footsteps of Motorola, which it acquired in 2014. The layer on top of Google’s OS is now called Pure UI and true to its name, you would only find minor changes as compared to stock Android. And, those changes are quite useful – the app drawer has a search bar at the top along with the frequently-used apps towards the right, support for gestures like double-tap-to-wake, use fingerprint sensor as a shutter button in the camera app, and more. There’s also support for dual app profiles letting you run two instances of apps like WhatsApp.The Lenovo K6 Note flaunts a 16-meg snapper at the back, supplemented by a dual-tone LED flash. Even though the megapixel count is impressive, it fails to change our opinion about the camera performance of Lenovo’s devices. While it’s able to lock focus on the objects quickly thanks to PDAF technology, and the shutter speed is good as well, the quality is anything but. Even in daylight, the outdoor shots show grains when zoomed into. That said, the images are fine for casual sharing on social media and colours are reproduced well too. Macro images also show lack of detail when viewed at full resolution. The phone also suffers from exposure issues with the touch-to-focus option resulting in overexposed or underexposed images. Like most handsets, the K6 Note also struggles in low light, with the images failing to offer much detail, though the LED flash does help a bit.    We do like the camera viewfinder on the Lenovo K6 Note. It’s loaded with options, and the smart composition mode is really helpful. It automatically detects what you want to capture – portrait, food, etc., and guides you to set the frame accordingly. It also comes with a Pro mode letting you tweak the ISO levels, shutter speed, and more. Strangely though, the phablet’s snapper lacks an HDR mode and offers an artistic HDR, which kind of acts like Instagram filters by sprucing the images – sometimes making them seem unnatural. The quality of selfies fare a bit better, and screen flash helps in shooting in dim environments. Sadly, the video recording tops at 1080p, which is a big bummer as quite a few smartphones in this price bracket support are capable of shooting 4K. Take a dekko at the pictures clicked with the Lenovo K6 Note.
You’d notice that we haven’t touched upon on the core hardware powering the Lenovo K6 Note… and that’s because it feels quite underwhelming. Under the hood, the phablet comes equipped with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 430 processor – which fuels the likes of Xiaomi Redmi 3s (review), available at half the price. In fact, the K6 Note’s sibling, the K6 Power also features the same SoC, but is priced below Rs 10,000. At a time when you can get phones powered by flagship chipsets like SD820 in this range, we’d have loved for Lenovo to at least opted for mid-range silicon such as the Snapdragon 650 or the battery-efficient Snapdragon 625. The effect of the same can be seen in the performance department. While day-to-day tasks work fine, the K6 Note falters while playing graphics-intensive titles such as Asphalt 8 or Leo’s Fortune. There are noticeable stutters and frame drops while playing. The device does boast of powerful multitasking capabilities though, as it’s available in both 3GB or 4GB RAM versions. Our 3GB RAM model offers good memory management as it’s able to access the apps in the same state we left them at.With each successive iteration of smartphones in the K series, the Chinese company seems to be moving up the value chain. While the K3 Note was priced attractively at Rs 9,999, the base model of the Lenovo K6 Note will set you back by Rs 13,999. If you opt for the higher-end 4GB RAM variant, then you’ll need to shell out Rs 15,999. While that’s still affordable, it also puts it in a highly competitive space with many of Lenovo’s own offerings. The most notable among the competition would be Lenovo’s Z2 Plus (review), which after a recent price cut is the most affordable smartphone with Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 820 chipset in India. If you are looking for battery-centric offering, then the Lenovo P2 (review) is a great option, although you’d need to extend your budget by a couple of grand. Moto’s budget smartphone, the G4 Plus (review) also remains a solid and reliable choice even months after its launch. When we talk about battery performance, then the Coolpad’s dual-camera toting Cool 1 (first impressions) is hard to ignore at its price tag of Rs 13,999. Xiaomi’s new Redmi Note 4 (review) is also set to shake up this price segment by offering a good mix of specs and long-lasting battery life.  Don’t get us wrong. The Lenovo K6 Note isn’t a bad device, and you can even pick it up from retail stores in your neighbourhood. However, you’ll get much better value for your money and a better, all round experience with one of the other smartphones mentioned above.        "

It’s supplemented by a dual-colour LED flash and a fingerprint sensor. The biometric authentication works like a charm every time and responds quickly too.
The 5.5-inch IPS display bears a resolution of 1,920 x 1,080 pixels, which offers sharp visuals and striking colours. While the screen is a bit reflective, we didn’t find any issues in reading it in outdoor settings. Thanks to its Dolby ATMOS support, the Lenovo K6 Note is an ideal option for multimedia addicts as it offers a good sound output. It also supports Virtual Reality with its Theatermax 3.0 technology, and you can instantly switch to VR mode with a single click. Sadly though, it lacks any protective layer on top of the display panel.Just like its compact sibling, the Lenovo K6 Note is a battery-centric offering. It ensures that the phablet lasts more than a day, even with heavy usage. We used the device on Jio’s VoLTE network to access the internet, stream content off Amazon Prime Video and play games – and it still had a decent amount of juice left at the end of the day. That said, it’s not as remarkable as its rivals featuring similar battery packs. In our video loop test, it was able to play back an HD video at 50 percent brightness and volume levels for approximately 11 hours and 15 minutes – a couple of hours lower than the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (review). It also supports fast charging with the bundled 2A adapter… fuelling the battery from 0 to 100 in 2 hours 30 minutes. Like its sibling, you can also use it to reverse charge your mobile devices.  In terms of the connectivity, the Lenovo K6 Note doesn’t miss out on anything. From dual-SIM connectivity to Wi-Fi b/g/n, Bluetooth, and GPS – the phablet has them all. The hybrid SIM slot gives you the flexibility of extending the storage if you need, although the available 32 gigs of flash memory on board should be sufficient for most of your needs.   We’re glad we can count the the software aspect of the K6 Note as one of its plus points. While earlier, the brand was famous (read infamous) for its heavy customisations on top of Android with Vibe UI, complete with custom icons and a dozen preloaded apps, the Chinese company seems to be now following the footsteps of Motorola, which it acquired in 2014. The layer on top of Google’s OS is now called Pure UI and true to its name, you would only find minor changes as compared to stock Android. And, those changes are quite useful – the app drawer has a search bar at the top along with the frequently-used apps towards the right, support for gestures like double-tap-to-wake, use fingerprint sensor as a shutter button in the camera app, and more. There’s also support for dual app profiles letting you run two instances of apps like WhatsApp.The Lenovo K6 Note flaunts a 16-meg snapper at the back, supplemented by a dual-tone LED flash. Even though the megapixel count is impressive, it fails to change our opinion about the camera performance of Lenovo’s devices. While it’s able to lock focus on the objects quickly thanks to PDAF technology, and the shutter speed is good as well, the quality is anything but. Even in daylight, the outdoor shots show grains when zoomed into. That said, the images are fine for casual sharing on social media and colours are reproduced well too. Macro images also show lack of detail when viewed at full resolution. The phone also suffers from exposure issues with the touch-to-focus option resulting in overexposed or underexposed images. Like most handsets, the K6 Note also struggles in low light, with the images failing to offer much detail, though the LED flash does help a bit.    We do like the camera viewfinder on the Lenovo K6 Note. It’s loaded with options, and the smart composition mode is really helpful. It automatically detects what you want to capture – portrait, food, etc., and guides you to set the frame accordingly. It also comes with a Pro mode letting you tweak the ISO levels, shutter speed, and more. Strangely though, the phablet’s snapper lacks an HDR mode and offers an artistic HDR, which kind of acts like Instagram filters by sprucing the images – sometimes making them seem unnatural. The quality of selfies fare a bit better, and screen flash helps in shooting in dim environments. Sadly, the video recording tops at 1080p, which is a big bummer as quite a few smartphones in this price bracket support are capable of shooting 4K. Take a dekko at the pictures clicked with the Lenovo K6 Note.
You’d notice that we haven’t touched upon on the core hardware powering the Lenovo K6 Note… and that’s because it feels quite underwhelming. Under the hood, the phablet comes equipped with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 430 processor – which fuels the likes of Xiaomi Redmi 3s (review), available at half the price. In fact, the K6 Note’s sibling, the K6 Power also features the same SoC, but is priced below Rs 10,000. At a time when you can get phones powered by flagship chipsets like SD820 in this range, we’d have loved for Lenovo to at least opted for mid-range silicon such as the Snapdragon 650 or the battery-efficient Snapdragon 625. The effect of the same can be seen in the performance department. While day-to-day tasks work fine, the K6 Note falters while playing graphics-intensive titles such as Asphalt 8 or Leo’s Fortune. There are noticeable stutters and frame drops while playing. The device does boast of powerful multitasking capabilities though, as it’s available in both 3GB or 4GB RAM versions. Our 3GB RAM model offers good memory management as it’s able to access the apps in the same state we left them at.With each successive iteration of smartphones in the K series, the Chinese company seems to be moving up the value chain. While the K3 Note was priced attractively at Rs 9,999, the base model of the Lenovo K6 Note will set you back by Rs 13,999. If you opt for the higher-end 4GB RAM variant, then you’ll need to shell out Rs 15,999. While that’s still affordable, it also puts it in a highly competitive space with many of Lenovo’s own offerings. The most notable among the competition would be Lenovo’s Z2 Plus (review), which after a recent price cut is the most affordable smartphone with Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 820 chipset in India. If you are looking for battery-centric offering, then the Lenovo P2 (review) is a great option, although you’d need to extend your budget by a couple of grand. Moto’s budget smartphone, the G4 Plus (review) also remains a solid and reliable choice even months after its launch. When we talk about battery performance, then the Coolpad’s dual-camera toting Cool 1 (first impressions) is hard to ignore at its price tag of Rs 13,999. Xiaomi’s new Redmi Note 4 (review) is also set to shake up this price segment by offering a good mix of specs and long-lasting battery life.  Don’t get us wrong. The Lenovo K6 Note isn’t a bad device, and you can even pick it up from retail stores in your neighbourhood. However, you’ll get much better value for your money and a better, all round experience with one of the other smartphones mentioned above.        "

The first smartphone in the range – the K3 Note (review) – was the most popular smartphone of 2015, while its successor, the Vibe K4 Note (review) sat at second place as the most popular phone of 2016. In fact, the company got so hopeful about the prospects of the series that it kept on adding successive devices in the range, in the form of the K5 Note (first impressions) and K6 Note. The latter was launched in December, and accompanies its compact and affordable sibling, the K6 Power (first impressions). With a price tag of Rs 13,999 (Rs 15,999 for the higher-end model), the Lenovo K6 Note might seem to be priced higher than the competition, but it still manages to stand out thanks to its offline availability. But is that enough to make it worth a buy? Well, that’s what we’ll be answering in our review.The K series has come of age. From the plastic-bodied K3 Note to the metal-clad K6 Note – the brand has continuously evolved the design language of the smartphones. The Lenovo K6 Note features a sturdy build thanks to its metal construction, while looks classy in grey. The best part is that even with a capacious battery of 4,000mAh, the phone doesn’t seem to be very thick at 8.4mm. Tipping the scales at 169g, its weight has been distributed well and it doesn’t feel too bulky in the hand. Having said that, the Lenovo K6 Note looks just like any other budget smartphone – a rectangular unibody metal slab with the usual placement of the ports and buttons. In fact, it simply is a bigger version of the K6 Power. The fascia is dominated by the 2.5D display panel, which is accompanied by a front-facing snapper and an earpiece above, and a row of capacitive keys at the bottom. Personally, we found the buttons to be an eyesore as they break the uniformity of the design.

You’d notice that we haven’t touched upon on the core hardware powering the Lenovo K6 Note… and that’s because it feels quite underwhelming. Under the hood, the phablet comes equipped with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 430 processor – which fuels the likes of Xiaomi Redmi 3s (review), available at half the price. In fact, the K6 Note’s sibling, the K6 Power also features the same SoC, but is priced below Rs 10,000. At a time when you can get phones powered by flagship chipsets like SD820 in this range, we’d have loved for Lenovo to at least opted for mid-range silicon such as the Snapdragon 650 or the battery-efficient Snapdragon 625. The effect of the same can be seen in the performance department. While day-to-day tasks work fine, the K6 Note falters while playing graphics-intensive titles such as Asphalt 8 or Leo’s Fortune. There are noticeable stutters and frame drops while playing. The device does boast of powerful multitasking capabilities though, as it’s available in both 3GB or 4GB RAM versions. Our 3GB RAM model offers good memory management as it’s able to access the apps in the same state we left them at.With each successive iteration of smartphones in the K series, the Chinese company seems to be moving up the value chain. While the K3 Note was priced attractively at Rs 9,999, the base model of the Lenovo K6 Note will set you back by Rs 13,999. If you opt for the higher-end 4GB RAM variant, then you’ll need to shell out Rs 15,999. While that’s still affordable, it also puts it in a highly competitive space with many of Lenovo’s own offerings. The most notable among the competition would be Lenovo’s Z2 Plus (review), which after a recent price cut is the most affordable smartphone with Qualcomm’s flagship Snapdragon 820 chipset in India. If you are looking for battery-centric offering, then the Lenovo P2 (review) is a great option, although you’d need to extend your budget by a couple of grand. Moto’s budget smartphone, the G4 Plus (review) also remains a solid and reliable choice even months after its launch. When we talk about battery performance, then the Coolpad’s dual-camera toting Cool 1 (first impressions) is hard to ignore at its price tag of Rs 13,999. Xiaomi’s new Redmi Note 4 (review) is also set to shake up this price segment by offering a good mix of specs and long-lasting battery life.  Don’t get us wrong. The Lenovo K6 Note isn’t a bad device, and you can even pick it up from retail stores in your neighbourhood. However, you’ll get much better value for your money and a better, all round experience with one of the other smartphones mentioned above.        "
1767,30,31052,4.5,5,2017-08-09,,31052,Nitansh Rastogi -,"Lenovo K8 Note review: killing it with its specs, pricing and capabilities",https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/lenovo-k8-note-review?pid=31052," A large 5.5-inch full HD display, 2GB RAM, and a 3,000mAh battery…. these specs might be mainstream now for budget smartphones, but they sure weren’t in 2015. That’s why, when Chinese giant Lenovo launched the K3 Note with such a powerful configuration (as per 2015’s standards) in June two years ago, the phone was an instant hit. In fact, as per 91mobiles’ mobile phone landscape report – the K3 Note was the most popular smartphone of the year 2015. Fast forward to now, and K3 Note has already given way to the K4 Note (review), the K5 Note (first impressions) and the K6 Note (review). But none of the successors have received the same amount of adulation as the progenitor.Enter the brand’s latest, which has a lot of expectations riding on it. Perhaps that explains the brand’s decision of skipping the number 7 from its moniker and jump straight to the K8 Note to highlight the generational leap. But is that so? Well, that’s what I intend to find out in this review. Related read: Lenovo K8 Note vs K6 Note – what’s new? I’ve been using the Lenovo K8 Note for a week, and have to say that the smartphone not only carries forward the awesome features of its predecessors, but also brings all the good stuff available in offerings from the competition (along with borrowing quite a few tricks from Moto devices). With prices starting at Rs 12,999 (Rs 13,999 for the higher-end model), the K8 Note has a killer pricing, and of course, a look at its spec sheet (mentioned above) suggests that it also has a killer instinct on all fronts – potentially capable of decimating the competition With a 5.5-inch display and 2.5D glass, a metal unibody construction, and curved edges, the Lenovo K8 Note looks just like any other budget offering. It’s only when you take a closer look, you’ll notice subtle, yet important differences. The fascia is dominated by the display panel, but there’s considerable space above and below. You’ll find the earpiece, a couple of sensors, and a secondary camera with LED flash above, and a row of capacitive keys below the screen. The navigation buttons follow the Android convention with the first key being used for returning to the previous screen, the home button for jumping to the home screen, and the last one for accessing recently-opened apps.The placement of ports and buttons on the Lenovo K8 Note is nothing out of the ordinary, though I must add that the buttons are extremely responsive and offer good tactile feedback. Thanks to the textured pattern, the power switch is also easy to identify just by feel. What will catch your attention however, is another key which sits on the left, symmetrically opposite the power switch. While the button has a music symbol, it’s actually much more than that. Let me get to that in a bit.
 Flip to the back and you’ll see the dual cameras – a first for the Lenovo K series. The dual cameras protrude on the K8 Note just a little and are accompanied by a dual-LED flash, with a fingerprint scanner placed below. There’s a Lenovo logo closer to the bottom. Talking about the fingerprint reader, it works as expected – it’s quick, accurate and offers 360-degree recognition. The Lenovo K8 Notes comes in two colour options of Fine Gold and Venom Black – and I got the latter for review. While I might be biased towards it, the all-black exterior looks quite premium and has a classy appeal. Thanks to the matte finish, the phone doesn’t feel slippery due to sweaty palms… and in case you feel the need, you can use the transparent cover that comes bundled. The Lenovo K8 Note is possibly the first device from the brand’s stable to offer a splash-proof P2i nano-coating. While you may not be able to dunk the phone in water, it’s certainly good to know that it can handle splashes. The 5.5-inch display on the Lenovo K8 Note is a 1080p affair with a pixel density of 401ppi, resulting in crisp text. The IPS panel offers vibrant colours. The brightness levels are also adequate, and I didn’t face any issue in reading the display outdoors. Protecting the display against scratches and accidental drops is a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass 3.  Like all Chinese companies, Lenovo used to layer its Android smartphones with a custom skin, and in the brand’s case, it was dubbed Vibe UI. It later started shipping Vibe Pure UI on its offerings to offer a clutter-free interface. But with the K8 Note, the brand is completely reversing its strategy. It has decided to take the same route as Moto devices, i.e. offering stock Android with the latest iteration.  The Android 7.1.1 Nougat build running on the Lenovo K8 Note is completely stock, and is devoid of any custom icons, themes or any other customisations. There’s hardly any bloatware either, save for Microsoft apps (since Lenovo made a strategic partnership with the Redmond giant a couple of years ago) and an app called Protect. As the name suggests, Protect helps you keep your personal information safe, along with highlighting the apps that are consuming the data the most. You can also enable VPN protection to encrypt your data while accessing the internet. With My Data Usage, you can also enter the limits of your monthly 3G /4G plans to keep track of cellular data consumption. Coming to the functionality of the Music key… as can be expected from its name, it lets you control music playback. Along with letting you play / pause songs by long-pressing, it also lets you jump to next or previous tracks with a double press or a triple press respectively. What I particularly liked is the fact that the key is completely configurable, and you can use the long-press to toggle the torch, take a screenshot or open just about any app, without forgoing the next / previous playback controls. The best thing is that it works with any app you’re using to play music, and not just the default Google Play Music, and it responds extremely fast.   Like its predecessors, the K8 Note also supports Virtual Reality as it comes with the company’s TheaterMax technology. It allows you to have a split-screen view (one for the left eye, and the other for the right one) with any app, even if it’s not made for VR, and all you need is a compatible headset to view it in VR.    Within a short time, dual cameras on phones have become a necessity rather than a rarity. And now, we’re seeing them across budgets, and not just in the high-end segment. Following the trend, Lenovo has bestowed the K8 Note with a pair of cameras – with the primary Purecel sensor rated at 13-megapixels with f/2.0 aperture and a 5MP secondary sensor from Samsung. The combination lets you click images with depth-of-field effect as the secondary camera captures depth information. The camera app also lets you choose the aperture between f/1.2, f/1.8 and f/2.8. Thanks to stock Android, you can access the camera app even from the lock screen or while using any other app by simply double-pressing the power button.  Talking about the camera interface, this is yet another thing which the phone has borrowed from its Moto cousins. I’m certainly glad for the same, since this means you get a minimalistic UI and can change exposure quite easily with the focus ring. The usual features are also present up front – the shutter button at the bottom (you can also enable the tap to click option) is flanked by the front camera toggle, plus access to different modes such as video, panorama and professional mode. As can be expected, the professional mode gives you granular control over focus point, white balance, ISO levels, etc. The options above include toggles for HDR, flash and a self-timer along with the depth mode. To access all the settings, you simply need to swipe to the right.  Since the cameras can capture depth info, the Lenovo K8 Note has a depth editor that lets you utilise the feature to apply a black and white filter selectively to a certain area, change focus along with different levels of blur, and even replace the background entirely. As far as the images clicked in this mode are concerned, they definitely look quite pleasing as your entire focus is on the subject. However, the aperture needs to be selected as per the need, as at times, the output looks unnatural. In some cases, I also noticed softness around the edges of the subject.     Coming to the camera quality, the Lenovo K8 Note is a versatile shooter that offers good performance across situations, be it in landscape images or close-ups. The pictures reproduce a good amount of details and vibrant colours, with noise kept to the minimum. The HDR mode is really effective and adds a lot of punch to the scene, although it takes some time to process. Like most smartphones, the K8 Note struggles in low light, but the dual-tone LED flash provides illumination without making the image look too artificial. Not just the twin cameras at the rear, the 13MP shooter at the front is also quite capable. Furthermore, it comes with HDR and Pro mode – which isn’t available on most phones for the front camera, and there’s an LED flash as well for ensuring bright selfies even in dim environments. Instead of reading what I think about the K8 Note’s camera performance, you can gawk at some image samples below.   
 Sadly, the handset can only capture full HD videos and not 4K even though the SoC is capable, which is odd considering quite a few smartphones in its budget offer this capability. I spoke to Anuj Sharma, Head – Product Marketing, Lenovo India, regarding the same, and he made a valid point that “users don’t really capture videos in 4K resolution as there aren’t many compatible TVs to consume the same. Additionally, if by mistake, someone has captured a video in this resolution, even a two-minute video would consume almost a GB of space”. He also added that the K8 Note’s camera will soon get a “slow-mo video recording via a software update”. Having said that, the Lenovo K8 Note certainly manages to capture killer shots with its dual rear cameras as well as its selfie snapper. Deca-core processors aren’t new – they’ve been around for almost two years when MediaTek launched its first chipset with 10 cores, the Helio X20. But for some reason, deca-core processors never caught on… quite possibly because no major phone maker utilised these SoCs. The Lenovo K8 Note aims to change that. It draws power from the Helio X23 SoC, which offers four power-efficient Cortex-A53 cores running at 1.4GHz, four powerful cores  Cortex-A53 tuned at 1.85GHz and the remaining two Cortex-A72 cores aimed at performance with a clock speed of 2.3GHz. Coupled with a Mali T-880 GPU, the smartphone promises buttery-smooth performance and incredible graphics. And my usage was a testament to that, as I didn’t face a trace of lag while navigating screens and jumping between apps. In fact, the K8 Note is easily the most powerful smartphone in its segment, as per benchmark results.   The gaming experience is no different, be it while playing casual titles such as Smash Hit or the graphics-heavy Asphalt 8 and Injustice 2. I often lost track of time while racing on tracks or fighting superheroes and supervillains from the DC universe. That said, the Lenovo K8 Note isn’t able to manage its thermal efficiency well as it tends to heat up within just 15 to 20 minutes of gaming. The heating issue also exists while using Google Maps or using the camera app for longer durations. Thankfully though, it doesn’t impact the performance in any manner.  The K8 Note also takes care of the multitasking aspect with the 3GB RAM in the base variant and 4GB in the higher-end model. Switching between apps is instantaneous, and at one point of time, I had as many as 15 apps open on my 4GB RAM unit without any issue. Depending on the variant, you’ll get 32GB or 64GB of storage on board. But you don’t need to worry about the limited storage, as the device comes with a dedicated microSD card slot to extend it up to 256GB.  Talking about the connectivity options, the dual-SIM smartphone offers 4G VoLTE support, along with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and GPS. The Lenovo K8 Note comes with a single speaker unit, but don’t undermine that. Thanks to Dolby Atmos support, the speaker offers loud output. With the available app, you can also tweak the equaliser settings or get enhanced bass.   With the Lenovo K6 Power (first impressions) and the K6 Note, the brand started packing massive 4,000mAh batteries in its K series, and the K8 Note comes fuelled with a battery of the same capacity. The smartphone can easily last a day even with heavy usage. In my case, the phone still had some juice left at the end of the day with cellular data enabled, 30 minutes of calls, an hour of GPS navigation, an hour of music streaming and a little bit of gaming. The handset also comes bundled with a 15W rapid charger, and the K8 Note can be charged fully in almost two hours.    When Lenovo launched the K3 Note, it branded it as the Killer Note, and while it didn’t opt for the same branding for its successors, the K8 Note is being dubbed as the #KillerNote – and rightly so, if I may add. The Lenovo K8 Note offers a killer combination ofpractical design, loaded specs, capable dual cameras, and a long-lasting battery along with a vanilla iteration of Android – all at a mouth-watering price. Add to it the fact that the phone is splash proof and offers a dedicated microSD card slot. At the starting price of Rs 12,999, the Lenovo K8 Note makes a strong case for itself, though that doesn’t mean that it doesn’t have any competition. The most obvious challenger is another ‘Note’ – the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (review). In my opinion, Lenovo’s latest not only packs in everything that the Redmi Note 4 offers, but also delivers better camera performance and the latest Android in its clean avatar. Then there’s the dual camera-toting Honor 6X (review), but the K8 Note edges past it because of the long-lasting battery and stock OS. It’s also up against a device from its own family, the Moto G5 Plus (review), but the K8 Note comes across as a better package, even including what has been the USP of Moto’s smartphones – the clean software. It’s clear that stock Android acts as the icing on what’s already a delicious cake.   All said and done, the Lenovo K8 Note is a fully-loaded smartphone that’s able to deliver on all the fronts. "
2055,30,30784,,,2019-02-07,,30784,Abdul -,"LG G8 ThinQ officially teased, to feature 3D TOF front camera",https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/lg-g8-thinq-teased-with-3d-tod-front-camera?pid=30784," “LG has officially teased the first key feature of the LG G8 ThinQ and we could see more in the coming days.” LG has made an official blog post today stating that it will be revealing the LG G7 ThinQ successor at MWC 2019. Furthermore, the Samsung rival has also revealed one of the key features of the LG G8 ThinQ on its official website. Sadly though, the post doesn’t give a sneak peek at the design of the handset even though enough renders of the smartphone have leaked in the past weeks revealing a lot about the device. As per the post, LG has collaborated with Infineon Technologies to introduce a 3D TOF front camera sensor in the LG G8 ThinQ. Not many details are available, but the post states that Infineon’s 3D sensor uses infrared light to make more accurate measurements as compared to other 3D technologies and hence comes with a remarkable accuracy rate. Obviously, the new tech will be used by LG to introduce a more secure and Face-ID like face unlock feature. Apparently, it could also have AR and VR implications that we know nothing about right now. 3D TOF sensors have started making the rounds in the smartphone segment recently with many OEMs like OPPO, and Honor including the sensor in their latest offerings. We previously brought you exclusive renders of the LG G8 back in January and if that is any indication, we’re likely to see a more contemporary notch design on the flagship with dual rear cameras. Yes, dual rear cameras and not triple sensors. That’s what the current leaks suggest and there will be a rear fingerprint reader. However, do note that these renders could also be a representation of an early prototype or LG might have changed the design of the handset. Hence we could end up seeing a different design at the launch event at MWC 2019.  "
2311,30,30948,,,2017-09-05,,30948,Deepak Dhingra -,LG Q6 review: a mixed bag that deserves a second look,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/lg-q6-review?pid=30948," “The Q6 is a bit of a mixed bag, but still quite noteworthy for what it brings” After dual cameras, it’s now the turn of widescreen displays to go mainstream. LG started the trend with the flagship G6 (review), followed closely by the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ (review). These are all premium phones of course, but the feature has already started trickling down to mid-range and even budget smartphones. Micromax’s Canvas Infinity (review) in fact, has brought widescreen displays to under Rs 10k. LG’s own affordable contender comes in the form of the Q6, a toned-down version of the LG G6… Put simply, the Q6 (first impressions) brings the G6’s bezel-less goodness to the masses, thanks to its affordable pricing. Let’s see how it fares as a daily driver.The key highlight of the Q6 has to be its 18:9 display, and thanks to that, the device is able to pack in a 5.5-inch screen in the body of a 5-inch phone. That aside, the Q6 is a bit of a mixed bag. It shines in areas like battery life and camera image quality, but leaves something to be desired when it comes to performance and build quality. The lack of a fingerprint scanner is also a bummer. The Q6 can easily be mistaken for a 5-inch smartphone, but in reality, it sports a 5.5-inch display. This sorcery is due to the 18:9 aspect ratio of the display and super-slim side bezels, which makes the overall size of the device quite compact. This also means it can be used easily with a single hand, which is something that can’t be said for most 5.5-inch smartphones. The LG Q6 looks quite stylish too, especially from the front. That said, the build quality is a bit of a mixed bag. While the aluminium frame should help, the plasticky back takes a little something away from the overall feel and collects fingerprints too.The screen offers a resolution of 2,160 x 1,080 pixels, which is slightly more than standard 1080p (because of the taller screen), and a very capable display it is too. The touch response is excellent, while the visuals are sharp and vivid. No issues with sunlight legibility or viewing angles either. The front is almost all screen, save for the slim side bezels and a small chin below that sports the LG logo. Up top, you’ll find the earpiece, sensors and front camera. At the bottom, you’ll see a micro-USB port and a 3.5mm headset socket, while the top is barren and just has the secondary mic. The power key is on the right, while the left is where you’ll see the two discrete volume adjustment keys. The left spine is also home to two ejectable trays – the first one accepts a nano-SIM, while the second one can take another nano-SIM and also a microSD card. The fact that the LG Q6 has a dedicated storage expansion slot is definitely a plus, since most dual-SIM phones are going the hybrid wayOn the flip side, the fingerprint scanner is conspicuous by its absence. Fingerprint scanners are present even on budget phones these days, and it’s a bummer that the Q6 misses out on this ubiquitous feature. It tries to make up for that by offering a face unlock feature, but that is a bit of a hit and miss – it works well usually but fails in less than ideal lighting conditions. Another gripe we have with the design of the LG Q6 is the placement of the speaker at the rear – as it tends to muffle the sound when the phone is placed on a flat surface.  With a 13MP f/2.2 primary shooter and a 5MP wide-angle selfie camera up front, the photography chops of the LG Q6 are fairly conventional. The camera app however, is quite loaded with features. The UI is minimalistic, and there are just a few basic shooting modes like auto, panorama and food on offer. A bunch of colour filters are there as well. We hate the fact the HDR mode is buried deep within the camera settings. Interestingly, the camera app also offers a square mode, which basically takes advantage of the phone’s 18:9 aspect ratio to divide the viewfinder into two squares. In this mode, the available options include a Snap shot, Match shot, Grid shot and Guide shot. Snap shot lets you shoot a picture and preview it directly on the bottom half of the screen, while Match shot lets you take two shots organised side by side. Grid shot allows you to take four images laid out in a single square photo, while Guide shot allows you to use an image of your choice as a reference to compose the picture you’re shooting. As can be seen from the sample shot embedded in the gallery below, the Q6 can take some nice shots. We found the daylight shots to be quite sharp and full of detail, while shots taken at night turned out to be better than expected. Suffice to say that most casual photographers should be pleased with the results it offers, selfie lovers included. There’s a screen flash feature for low-light self-portraits.
  The Q6 runs Android Nougat 7.1.1, layered with LG’s feature-packed custom skin. You don’t get a dedicated app drawer by default, but there’s an option to download LG Home and get that back if you so desire. There are tons of other features including an option to change the sequence and combination of the software-based navigation keys (you can have up to five virtual keys, including one to display the notification panel), a blue light filter for the display, KnockON that lets you double tap the screen to turn it on or off, and an app scaling feature that lets you adjust screen size of downloaded apps on a per-app basis. Preloaded apps include QuickMemo+ and Smart Doctor that includes a battery saver and diagnostics. Those coming from stock Android might feel a tad overwhelmed by the abundance of options available, so do keep that in mind. Otherwise, LG’s custom skin shouldn’t require a big learning curve. This is where things start to go downhill for the Q6. It packs a Snapdragon 435 with 3 gigs of RAM, a combination which is available at lower price points these days. Even if we ignore that for a bit, the usage experience offered by the Q6 leaves something to be desired, as lag creeps up occasionally, even while navigating the phone and using regular apps. It’s fine for casual gaming, but heavy games also show occasional frame drops. Clearly, the Q6 isn’t for power users and heavy games, but others should still be mostly fine with it provided they know what to expect. On the positive side, the 3,000mAh battery lasts quite long. The phone lasted almost 12 hours in our video loop test, and in real life usage, we usually went home with at least 30-35 percent fuel left in the tank after long workdays, with moderate usage throughout. As is quite evident, the LG Q6 has its share of pluses and minuses. It looks good, offers a wide aspect screen at an affordable price, and shoots reasonably well too. The battery is the icing on the cake. However, the lack of a fingerprint scanner and the occasional lag that creeps up sours the deal. Further, the price bracket occupied by the Q6 is packed with tons of options, some of which are quite powerful and compelling. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (review) is still a solid option of course, but newer contenders like the Lenovo K8 Note (review) and the Moto G5s Plus (first impressions) are better all-rounders in comparison as well. The K8 Note and G5s Plus even offer dual cameras. And with the launch of the Xiaomi Mi A1 (review), which is an Android One smartphone and rocks dual cameras as well, things look even tougher for the Q6. Despite its unique widescreen display then, the LG Q6 struggles to make a mark, especially given the competition it faces. That said, it’s still worth a look for those who aren’t power users, and are enticed by the prospect of a smartphone that offers a reasonably large screen size in a compact package."
2318,30,33472,,,2018-10-04,,33472,Ketaki Bhojnagarwala -,Nokia 5.1 Plus review: the budget smartphone gets a chic makeover,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nokia-5-1-plus-review?pid=33472," We’ve become accustomed to smartphones in the Rs 10,000 – Rs 15,000 range offering ample horsepower, capable cameras and capacious batteries. There are two areas where budget smartphones lack however – design and software. Nokia wants to change this. The company has launched a slew of Android One smartphones of late, offering a stock interface and guaranteed timely Android updates. And while the brand has continued to offer its trademark build quality on all its devices since its rebirth under HMD Global, it’s gone a step further with its recent spate of launches. The Nokia 5.1 Plus is one such device, and boasts a design and materials that are borrowed from its more expensive siblings, the Nokia 6.1 Plus (review) and the Nokia 7.1 Plus. The 5.1 Plus has a clear advantage over the competition on this front, but how does it fare in other aspects? Here’s what I found. The Nokia 5.1 Plus looks a flagship. I’m not kidding – the phone felt equally if not more premium than my iPhone 8. Like the Nokia 6.1 Plus, it features a glass sandwich design with a shiny polycarbonate frame. The phone feels really solid in the hand, and although the use of glass makes it slippery (you’d definitely want to slap a case on), it’s still got that sturdiness you’d expect from a Nokia device. The Nokia 5.1 Plus borrows the fullscreen 19:9 display with the notch from the 6.1 Plus, along with thin bezels on the side and a narrow chin at the bottom. The high screen-to-body ratio means that even with the 5.8-inch display, the phone can be easily used with one hand, and I say that as someone with small hands. 
 The device features a USB Type-C port, which you won’t find on most phones in this price band, and thankfully it also retains the 3.5mm jack. The display features HD+ resolution, and while icons and text look sharp, I found that colours looked a bit washed out, especially while playing videos. The Nokia 5.1 Plus also offers an Ambient Display feature, which blacks out the screen and shows you the time, date and notifications when you pick up the device. The rear camera on the Nokia 5.1 Plus is a 13MP f/2.0 PDAF unit assisted by a 5MP depth sensor to allow bokeh shots. At the front, there’s an 8MP selfie camera with f/2.2 aperture.  The rear camera can manage decent daylight images, but struggles with focus. I found many photos out of focus even in bright daylight, with the tiniest movement resulting in motion blur. While colours were true to life, images lacked the detail and clarity that you’d find from other cameras in this price range, such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 (review). The bokeh mode features an adjustable slider to change depth and works well enough, although I did notice visible softening around the edges. The front camera can take decent selfies provided the lighting is good. It also offers a bokeh mode, but this is software generated so you can’t adjust the level of depth. As mentioned earlier, the Nokia 5.1 Plus is an Android One handset, and therefore runs a stock version of Android 8.1 Oreo. Thanks to the Android One program, you can expect security updates for three years and Android updates for two years. Nokia has an excellent track record when it comes to pushing updates to its devices, so you can expect the same on the 5.1 Plus. Powering the handset is an octa-core MediaTek Helio P60 chipset, paired with 3GB of RAM. You get 32GB of onboard storage, out of which about 22GB is available to use. You can expand the storage using the microSD card slot, but you’d have to sacrifice a SIM card slot in the process. In my usage, I found the phone to be more than capable of multi-tasking with everyday tasks like browsing, watching videos and using social media apps like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. Asphalt 9: Legends plays fine on default graphics settings, and the phone remained cool to the touch after a 20-30 minute gaming session. That said, the Nokia 5.1 isn’t buttery smooth. There’s a short lag (a second or so) when loading the camera app for the first time, and delays between pressing the shutter and the photo being processed. Opening apps and unlocking the phone also took slightly longer than I would have liked – again I’m talking seconds here, but it’s noticeable.  The battery on the Nokia 5.1 Plus is the same as that on the 6.1 Plus – a 3,060mAh unit. The battery easily lasted me an entire day, with over five hours of screen time. If you’re a power user though, you might find yourself reaching for the charger by the evening. In our battery drain test, the Nokia 5.1 Plus lasted for close to 12 hours, while recharging it with the bundled charger took about 2 hours.   When 91mobiles reviewed the Nokia 6.1 Plus, we praised the device for its design and vanilla software, but felt it lost out to the competition from Xiaomi and ASUS. With the Nokia 5.1 Plus, I’m leaning towards the same opinion. Nokia has really nailed the design of the 5.1 Plus – at Rs 10,990 you won’t find any smartphone which comes close to offering the same build quality. I also like the fact that Nokia has opted for USB Type-C on the device, and kept the software completely devoid of bloatware. But there are areas where the Nokia 5.1 Plus falters – the cameras for instance are not on par with the competition, and the performance and battery life can’t match up to the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 and ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1. That said, with the 5.1 Plus, it feels like Nokia has finally cracked the code for budget phones, and I’m keen to see future offerings from the brand in this segment."
2319,30,32786,3.5,5,2018-09-03,,32786,Prateek Pandey -,Nokia 6.1 Plus review: a looker that gets some things right,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nokia-6-1-plus-review?pid=32786," “Here’s our comprehensive review of Nokia’s latest midranger – the Nokia 6.1 Plus.It’s been two years since Nokia got back into the reckoning and in that time, the company has launched numerous Android smartphones with compelling specs and features. It goes without saying that the company’s factories are working at full capacity, as the brand recently unveiled yet another smartphone to compete in the budget segment. Dubbed the Nokia 6.1 Plus, the smartphone was initially launched in China as the Nokia X6 and it is the first device from the company’s stables to ship with a display notch.  Moreover, you’ll also get the usual array of a glass-back design, the latest Android software and dual-cameras with the smartphone. But, is that enough to fend off the competition from the likes of Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 5 Pro (review) and ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 (review)? Stay with me to find out.  They say looks are subjective, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn’t fancy the design of the Nokia 6.1 Plus. Unlike its predecessors which employed metal in their construction, the Nokia 6.1 Plus ships with glass on both the front as well as the back, held together by a metal trim. Although it’s not uncommon to find glass-back designs in the affordable segment anymore, the build quality on the Nokia 6.1 Plus is impeccable and it blows the competition out of the water. The 2.5D curved glass merges seamlessly into the smartphone’s frame, the chamfered metal trim feels exquisite to the touch and despite the glass surface encompassing almost 93 percent of the handset’s entire body, the Nokia 6.1 Plus doesn’t come across as delicate. This kind of confidence can only be instilled in the buyers by Nokia. Moreover, to ensure that the 6.1 Plus’ design doesn’t feel bland, Nokia has added chrome trims around the handset’s camera module and physical buttons which further enhance the smartphone’s aesthetics. Quite honestly, the Nokia 6.1 Plus looks and feels a lot like Apple’s high-end iPhone X, which says a lot about the smartphone’s excellent design. What’s more, similar to Apple’s offering, the Nokia 6.1 Plus feels extremely compact in the hand, despite its massive 5.8-inch display. This is in a large part due to the smartphone’s sleek bezels, which make it so that the display takes up over 81 percent of the smartphone’s frame. Unfortunately, as is the case with most glass-back devices, the Nokia 6.1 Plus smudges really easily and is quite slippery too. I got the black colour variant of the smartphone to review and it is a nightmare to keep fingerprints from sticking to the back of the device. Moreover, don’t let the presence of a layer of Corning’s Gorilla Glass V3 on the smartphone fool you – it still picks up scratches and dings like any other glass-back device out there. Therefore, you’d be better off slapping a case on the smartphone if you want to keep the smartphone in a pristine condition.  I would also like to point out that the fingerprint sensor on the smartphone has been positioned a bit too low for my liking. The sensor sits below the smartphone’s dual-camera setup and its placement takes a while to get used to. In fact, I spent the first few days tapping at the smartphone’s camera module and wondering why isn’t the device getting unlocked. But, once you get used to the sensor’s placement, you’ll find that it works quite well – fingerprints are registered in the blink of an eye and you’ll be inside your home screen in under a second. Also, the Nokia 6.1 Plus ships with a headphone socket, which is being omitted from select affordable  As I mentioned previously, the Nokia 6.1 Plus ships with a 5.8-inch display with a cutout at the centre to make room for the secondary camera and the earpiece. Now, I do not advocate the use of a notch unless it’s absolutely needed, as was the case with the iPhone X. However, the notch on the Nokia 6.1 Plus is considerably smaller than what you would get with other devices. Moreover, if you dislike the notch all that much, then you can disable it from within the settings. I feel that Nokia is pandering to both, the notch lovers and haters alike, which is a smart move to sell more phones.  As far as the display is concerned, the panel makes use of IPS LCD technology and bears FHD+ resolution. Unsurprisingly, the text feels razor sharp on the smartphone’s display and the colours, though not as vibrant as exhibited by an AMOLED panel, feel tasteful to the eyes too. The viewing angles are really good, so you’ll need to be wary of hiding sensitive information whilst commuting in a metro from nosy people. Unfortunately, the display doesn’t get too bright so you might have to squint your eyes under direct sunlight to see the content being displayed. If I could end my review here, I would’ve given the smartphone a big ol’ thumbs up. But, there are some other things you should know before pulling the trigger on your purchase. Take it from someone who reviews smartphone on a day-to-day basis – you can get a really good smartphone with capable cameras by spending just south of Rs 20K. Be it the Xiaomi Mi A2 or the recently unveiled POCO F1, there are options galore for aspiring photographers to get a good smartphone with decent cameras without burning a hole in their wallets. Can then, the Nokia 6.1 Plus join the ranks of the elites I mentioned previously? Well, before I answer that, let’s talk about the smartphone’s camera specs. if  The Nokia 6.1 Plus comes equipped with a pair of 16MP and 5MP shooters at the back with f/2.0 and f/2.4 apertures respectively. For selfies, you’ll be smiling into a 16MP shooter, with f/2.4 aperture. Coming to the performance of the rear cameras, the Nokia 6.1 Plus will often test your patience as its primary shooters take a while to latch on to the subject. However, your patience will be rewarded fruitfully once the smartphone does get the subject in focus, provided you’re shooting under ideal lighting scenarios. By that, I mean that you’ll want to be outdoors on a bright sunny day with the sun behind you, casting natural light on to your subject.
 The shots I took with the smartphone during daytime were brilliant – the macros had plenty of details, the landscapes looked straight out of a movie and the colours felt natural. The smartphone’s built-in HDR mode did its job well too and boosted the colours and the details in the highlights and the shadows to make a scene feel more pleasing to the eyes. That said, the smartphone’s rear cameras struggle to process the colour ‘red’, which is evident when you try to click close-ups of flowers. Shots taken in portrait mode looked nice, however, the blur effect along the borders of the subject wasn’t as consistent as I’d liked it to be. Unsurprisingly, the cameras struggle to lock down on the subject at night, and even when they do, the quality of the image will rarely ever meet your expectations.   As for selfies, I managed to click some good-looking self-portraits with ample details in a well-lit environment. Moreover, if you’re not a fan of the pseudo beautification done by most Chinese smartphones, then you’ll love the natural-looking selfies from the Nokia 6.1 Plus. Unfortunately, since the smartphone doesn’t ship with a dedicated LED flash module for the front camera, the quality of selfies taken at night takes a minor dip.  For its asking price, the Nokia 6.1 Plus will go head-to-head with Xiaomi’s recently launched Mi A2 (review). Now, from a performance standpoint, the Mi A2 packs in more powerful hardware but, having used both the smartphones intensively, I can confidently say that the Nokia 6.1 Plus is no slouch when it comes to tackling everyday tasks.  Underneath its glass-chassis, the Nokia 6.1 Plus is driven by an octa-core Snapdragon 636 processor which works alongside 4GB of RAM and 64GB of built-in storage. However, unlike the Mi A2, the Nokia 6.1 Plus does offer you the choice between using two SIMs or expanding the built-in memory up to 400GB by popping in a microSD card.  In terms of performance, the Nokia 6.1 Plus managed to keep pace with my intensive usage comfortably. Navigating through the system UI was a breeze, multitasking was as smooth as butter and despite having a dozen apps open in the background, the smartphone didn’t slow down to catch its breath. That said, if you’re an avid gamer, then you will find faults with the smartphone’s processor. As an example, PUBG automatically defaults the graphics settings to low, which drops the draw distance, making it difficult to spot enemies from afar. On the other hand, buyers investing in the similarly-priced Xiaomi Mi A2 will be able to enjoy the title at medium graphics settings comfortably. Similarly, other demanding titles like Asphalt 9 and Unkilled were a bit choppy too when I was playing them with the graphics setting set to max.    On the flip side, the software onboard the Nokia 6.1 Plus is a joy to use. The smartphone runs Android Oreo from the get go, but since it is an Android One device, you will get the latest Android Pie update down the line for sure. Now, I have a slight bias towards smartphones which ship with stock Android which made using the Nokia 6.1 Plus that more fun for me. I didn’t have to worry about unnecessary bloatware eating up my device’s storage and there were no irrelevant notifications clogging up my status bar, asking me to sign in to a third-party app store or account. All in all, the software on the Nokia 6.1 Plus is clean and functional – what more could anyone ask for?    Nokia phones have for long been hailed for their incredible battery life which could last users for days on end. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the Nokia 6.1 Plus’ 3,060mAh battery, which required me to plug in the smartphone twice a day. To give you some perspective, I managed to get around four hours of screen on time with the device, with my usage including playing some casual games, browsing through my social media feeds, messaging and listening to music. Moreover, you should know that the smartphone lasted 11 hours on our 91mobiles battery test, which is average at best. The Nokia 6.1 Plus certainly has a lot going for it. For its asking price of Rs 16,999, the handset features a beautiful design, is a decent performer, comes with expandable storage and features a capable selfie-camera. However, in the cut-throat smartphone industry, there are a plethora of other options which could give you more bang for your buck. The Xiaomi Mi A2 comes instantly to mind, which offers better performance and superior cameras as compared to Nokia’s offering.  Moreover, you could even opt for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro or the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1, both of which offer the same core specs as the Nokia 6.1 Plus, albeit are priced slightly lower. Lastly, if you can stretch your budget a bit, then you could get your hands on the much more powerful POCO F1 (review) or the Honor Play (review) too.  Consequently, while the Nokia 6.1 Plus is a good smartphone, it’s overshadowed by better offerings from the competition. And round and round we go.   "

2422,30,33149,4,5,2018-12-10,,33149,Nitansh Rastogi -,Nokia 8.1 review: the dependable mid-ranger you were waiting for,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nokia-8-1-review?pid=33149," When I reviewed the Nokia 7 Plus earlier this year, I proclaimed it one of the most reliable smartphones in the mid-budget segment you could buy. However, since then the category has attracted a lot of attention with players like ASUS and POCO offering flagship-grade specs in the same league. So it was but natural for the Finnish company to launch a successor to the 7 Plus. While I’ll leave it up to the company to explain its confusing nomenclature… since the Nokia 8.1 actually succeeds the 7 Plus, yet seems to be an upgrade the Nokia 8 flagship, there’s no denying that the smartphone is a loaded handset. So can it help the phonemaker to reclaim its share in the ~Rs 30k segment? Let’s find that out together in this review. Just like the Nokia 5.1 Plus (review) and 6.1 Plus (review), which are rebranded iterations of the Nokia X5 and X6 respectively, the 8.1 was launched in China as the X7. Like all the smartphones in this series, the Nokia 8.1 sports a glass-sandwich design with an aluminium frame and a display notch. As you can guess, the build quality of Nokia’s 8.1 is top-notch (pun intended). Not only does the device look classy, but it also feels solid when held in the hand. The phone utilises Series 6000 aluminium that makes it seem very robust. While the phone tips the scales at 180g, the weight has been distributed really well. The smartphone is also quite sleek, thanks to a 7.97mm waist.Flip to the back, and the familiarity continues… a dual-camera module in the middle accompanied by a dual-tone LED flash with a fingerprint reader below. Sadly, the camera module juts out from the body significantly making the phone wobble on a flat surface if you press on its either side. Of course, the glass-back design also means that the Nokia 8.1 attracts fingerprints and smudges like there’s no tomorrow. That also makes the phone quite slippery, especially if your hands are sweaty. Despite its attractive design, I’d recommend you use a case with it (sadly, the device doesn’t come bundled with one).  As far as the fingerprint sensor’s unlocking speed is concerned, it works like a charm. It’s accurate, quick and works regardless of the direction you place your finger in. Of course, you might not need to use it often as the Nokia 8.1 comes with face unlock functionality (available as the Trusted Face in Security & location settings). Even though the face unlock isn’t the fastest I’ve come across, it works quite reliably in most scenarios (except in poorly-lit conditions).
Coming to the other design elements, the Nokia 8.1 follows the norm. Though it’s good to see that the phone hasn’t skimped upon the 3.5mm audio interface.Coming to the display, the 8.1 features a 6.18-inch IPS panel with a resolution of 1,080 x 2,220 pixels and an aspect ratio of 18.7:9. The screen gets plenty sharp and offers vibrant colours as well. It also gets sufficiently bright to be read outdoors, though the adaptive brightness somehow reduces the brightness levels drastically and you have to increase that manually. Similar to the recently-launched Nokia 7.1 (first impressions), the brand’s latest also comes with PureDisplay supporting HDR10, allowing you to enjoy compatible videos with better contrast and saturation. There’s also support for Always-on display, letting you see notifications along with date and time without waking up the screen.  
 Ever since its comeback, we’ve had high hopes from Nokia in the camera department. That’s because even before the current crop of camera-centric smartphones, Nokia has been there and done that. Crazy megapixels? Check. Ability to click RAW photos? Check. High-quality optics? Check (thanks to its partnership with ZEISS). Sadly however, we’ve seen mixed results from the brand with regards to the imaging capabilities. But if my experience with the Nokia 8.1 is anything to go by, the brand has a winner on its hands. In terms of specs, you get a 12MP optically-stabilised shooter with a 1.4um sensor size, which is paired with a 13MP depth sensor. The lenses are ZEISS-certified, while the camera offers live bokeh mode, and can record 4K videos along with slow-mo and timelapse clips. For selfies, the handset flaunts a high-res 20-megapixel snapper, though it’s a fixed-focus unit.  While Nokia has always focused on simplicity, the custom camera app on the 8.1 is packed with a number of options. It’s not user-friendly either, though once you get the hang of it, you’d appreciate the availability of so many modes. In the portrait mode, you get the shutter button, the preview gallery, toggle for the selfie camera at the bottom. Above it, you’ll find various shooting modes like Pro, Live Bokeh, Panorama, Video, and Slow-mo, among others. Up top, you can access the settings menu, activate Google Lens to identify objects or monuments, enable or disable motion, beauty mode, self-timer, toggling flash.However, I’m sure you are interested in how and why the Nokia 8.1 brings back the good ol’ memories of Nokia’s imaging prowess. Well, that’s because the brand’s latest is quick to focus (thanks to PDAF) and shoot, and works well in all conditions. In daylight, the pictures show a great level of detail, along with reproducing natural colours. I kept the smartphone on Auto HDR, and that turned out to be a good decision as there’s a noticeable difference between normal shots and those with High Dynamic Range. Close-ups also continue to impress. I also liked the low-light capabilities as the smartphone does a great job in keeping the noise to minimum and colours are also vibrant. Videos also turn out to be smooth, all thanks to OIS and EIS support. Here’s a gallery of camera samples taken from the Nokia 8.1 for your viewing pleasure.ttps://static.hub.91mobiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nokia-8.1-camera-samples-91mobiles-07-80x60.jpg) 0 0 no-repeat;
Talking about selfies, the 20MP shooter does offer well-detailed pictures. Sadly however, the snapper is unable to control exposure. Combine that with not-so-natural looking selfies, and the results might look quite artificial. That said, for all intents and purposes, the 8.1 will meet your needs to impress your followers on Instagram and Snapchat. Of course, the 8.1 isn’t the only option in its segment. It’ll be going up against the POCO F1, and from my experience, the debut offering from Xiaomi’s sub-brand comes out ahead. The images are crisper in comparison, even in dim environments. The portrait mode also works better in the case of the POCO phone. However, in the case of selfies, the Nokia handset gets an edge as the images capture more details.                 
 The Nokia 7 Plus was the first smartphone in India to draw power from Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 660 chipset. Carrying that legacy forward, the 8.1 is the second device in the subcontinent to come equipped with the Snapdragon 710 SoC. The chip brings several flagship features from the SD8xx series, including the power-efficient 10nm fabrication process. The octa-core silicon features custom-built Kryo 360 architecture which has two quad-core clusters running at 2.2GHz and 1.7GHz, respectively. For graphics, Snapdragon 710 comes integrated with Adreno 616 GPU. The hardware ensures incredibly smooth performance, which is also likely due to the fact that the smartphone is part of Android One and runs the latest iteration of Google’s mobile OS, i.e. 9.0 Pie. There’s zero bloatware in the OS, and apart from the custom camera app (described above), all the apps in the device are stock. The Nokia 8.1 also offers swift multitasking, thanks to 4GB of RAM.  But all the aforesaid stuff probably won’t make any difference to you if the phone can’t let you scream ‘winner winner, chicken dinner’, right? I’m happy to report that you’d be doing that often (if you’re proficient in PUBG, unlike me) as the phone plays the title in high settings and runs it without issues. Sadly however, the device is unable to keep thermals under control. It gets noticeably hot while playing a game for more than 15 minutes. And while that can probably be given a pass, the handset even got warm with normal usage like streaming a video on 4G with GPS being enabled for navigation purposes.  On the storage side of things, the Nokia 8.1 ships with 64GB memory onboard. And if that’s not enough, then you can top it up by another 400GB with the use of a microSD card, but you’ll need to sacrifice on the dual-SIM functionality to do that. While Nokia prides itself on the stereo speakers on some of its smartphones, it’s strange to see a single, teeny speaker at the base of the 8.1 Not only is the sound output nothing to write home about, the speaker also gets covered while playing games or watching videos in the landscape orientation. 
 One of the biggest hallmarks of the Nokia 7 Plus was its battery life as it shipped with a 3,800mAh cell. The Nokia 8.1 also aims to continue in the same vein, although it comes with a slightly smaller 3,500mAh battery. However, when combined with the power-efficient processor, you get similar battery life, if not better. Strangely however, in our battery test wherein we play an HD video on loop with both the brightness and volume set at 50 percent levels, the phone was only able to run 11 hours, which is just about average. In real-life however, the smartphone usually had about 20 to 25 percent by the end of the day. The screen-on time is also quite impressive as I got around more than four and a half hours on more than one occasion.  The Nokia 8.1 also supports 18W fast charging, allowing you to juice it up quickly. With the bundled adapter, the smartphone was able to go from 0 to 100 in about two hours and 30 minutes, which isn’t the best in terms of charging time, but isn’t the worst either. 
 In China, the Nokia X7 has been priced aggressively at RMB 1,699 (~Rs 17,500) for its base model. Sadly, the brand hasn’t kept the pricing at similar levels In India, since the phone will set you back by Rs 26,999. For the price, you get a gorgeous design, impressive display, powerful cameras, smooth performance and day-long battery life – all with the goodness of Android One making it future-proof. I’m saying that because you get assured updates for the next two years. So is this the best smartphone you could buy under Rs 30,000? Well, that’s where things get muddy. As I mentioned in the introduction, unlike earlier, the Rs 20k-30k price bracket has caught the attention of quite a few companies which are offering loaded smartphones. Of course, the most notable of these is the POCO F1 (review), which is the most affordable smartphone with the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 845 SoC and has also received a price cut recently, making it an even more enticing proposition. ASUS also has the ZenFone 5Z (review) on offer that’s priced slightly higher, and comes powered by the SD845 chip.  Choosing between the 8.1 and the aforesaid options completely depends upon whether you’re looking for hard-core performance or reliability. And therein lies the charm for Nokia’s offering. If you’re looking for a no-nonsense smartphone in the mid-tier that doesn’t skimp on any aspect, then the Nokia 8.1 won’t disappoint you in any regard.   "
2198,30,33462,4,5,2018-12-10,,33462,Nitansh Rastogi -,Nokia 8.1 review: the dependable mid-ranger you were waiting for,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nokia-8-1-review?pid=33462," When I reviewed the Nokia 7 Plus earlier this year, I proclaimed it one of the most reliable smartphones in the mid-budget segment you could buy. However, since then the category has attracted a lot of attention with players like ASUS and POCO offering flagship-grade specs in the same league. So it was but natural for the Finnish company to launch a successor to the 7 Plus. While I’ll leave it up to the company to explain its confusing nomenclature… since the Nokia 8.1 actually succeeds the 7 Plus, yet seems to be an upgrade the Nokia 8 flagship, there’s no denying that the smartphone is a loaded handset. So can it help the phonemaker to reclaim its share in the ~Rs 30k segment? Let’s find that out together in this review.Just like the Nokia 5.1 Plus (review) and 6.1 Plus (review), which are rebranded iterations of the Nokia X5 and X6 respectively, the 8.1 was launched in China as the X7. Like all the smartphones in this series, the Nokia 8.1 sports a glass-sandwich design with an aluminium frame and a display notch. As you can guess, the build quality of Nokia’s 8.1 is top-notch (pun intended). Not only does the device look classy, but it also feels solid when held in the hand. The phone utilises Series 6000 aluminium that makes it seem very robust. While the phone tips the scales at 180g, the weight has been distributed really well. The smartphone is also quite sleek, thanks to a 7.97mm waist.Flip to the back, and the familiarity continues… a dual-camera module in the middle accompanied by a dual-tone LED flash with a fingerprint reader below. Sadly, the camera module juts out from the body significantly making the phone wobble on a flat surface if you press on its either side. Of course, the glass-back design also means that the Nokia 8.1 attracts fingerprints and smudges like there’s no tomorrow. That also makes the phone quite slippery, especially if your hands are sweaty. Despite its attractive design, I’d recommend you use a case with it (sadly, the device doesn’t come bundled with one).  As far as the fingerprint sensor’s unlocking speed is concerned, it works like a charm. It’s accurate, quick and works regardless of the direction you place your finger in. Of course, you might not need to use it often as the Nokia 8.1 comes with face unlock functionality (available as the Trusted Face in Security & location settings). Even though the face unlock isn’t the fastest I’ve come across, it works quite reliably in most scenarios (except in poorly-lit conditions).
 Coming to the other design elements, the Nokia 8.1 follows the norm. Though it’s good to see that the phone hasn’t skimped upon the 3.5mm audio interface. Coming to the display, the 8.1 features a 6.18-inch IPS panel with a resolution of 1,080 x 2,220 pixels and an aspect ratio of 18.7:9. The screen gets plenty sharp and offers vibrant colours as well. It also gets sufficiently bright to be read outdoors, though the adaptive brightness somehow reduces the brightness levels drastically and you have to increase that manually. Similar to the recently-launched Nokia 7.1 (first impressions), the brand’s latest also comes with PureDisplay supporting HDR10, allowing you to enjoy compatible videos with better contrast and saturation. There’s also support for Always-on display, letting you see notifications along with date and time without waking up the screen.  
 Ever since its comeback, we’ve had high hopes from Nokia in the camera department. That’s because even before the current crop of camera-centric smartphones, Nokia has been there and done that. Crazy megapixels? Check. Ability to click RAW photos? Check. High-quality optics? Check (thanks to its partnership with ZEISS). Sadly however, we’ve seen mixed results from the brand with regards to the imaging capabilities. But if my experience with the Nokia 8.1 is anything to go by, the brand has a winner on its hands. In terms of specs, you get a 12MP optically-stabilised shooter with a 1.4um sensor size, which is paired with a 13MP depth sensor. The lenses are ZEISS-certified, while the camera offers live bokeh mode, and can record 4K videos along with slow-mo and timelapse clips. For selfies, the handset flaunts a high-res 20-megapixel snapper, though it’s a fixed-focus unit.  While Nokia has always focused on simplicity, the custom camera app on the 8.1 is packed with a number of options. It’s not user-friendly either, though once you get the hang of it, you’d appreciate the availability of so many modes. In the portrait mode, you get the shutter button, the preview gallery, toggle for the selfie camera at the bottom. Above it, you’ll find various shooting modes like Pro, Live Bokeh, Panorama, Video, and Slow-mo, among others. Up top, you can access the settings menu, activate Google Lens to identify objects or monuments, enable or disable motion, beauty mode, self-timer, toggling flash.However, I’m sure you are interested in how and why the Nokia 8.1 brings back the good ol’ memories of Nokia’s imaging prowess. Well, that’s because the brand’s latest is quick to focus (thanks to PDAF) and shoot, and works well in all conditions. In daylight, the pictures show a great level of detail, along with reproducing natural colours. I kept the smartphone on Auto HDR, and that turned out to be a good decision as there’s a noticeable difference between normal shots and those with High Dynamic Range. Close-ups also continue to impress. I also liked the low-light capabilities as the smartphone does a great job in keeping the noise to minimum and colours are also vibrant. Videos also turn out to be smooth, all thanks to OIS and EIS support. Here’s a gallery of camera samples taken from the Nokia 8.1 for your viewing pleasure.url(https://static.hub.91mobiles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Nokia-8.1-camera-samples-91mobiles-07-80x60.jpg) 0 0 no-repeat;
 Talking about selfies, the 20MP shooter does offer well-detailed pictures. Sadly however, the snapper is unable to control exposure. Combine that with not-so-natural looking selfies, and the results might look quite artificial. That said, for all intents and purposes, the 8.1 will meet your needs to impress your followers on Instagram and Snapchat. Of course, the 8.1 isn’t the only option in its segment. It’ll be going up against the POCO F1, and from my experience, the debut offering from Xiaomi’s sub-brand comes out ahead. The images are crisper in comparison, even in dim environments. The portrait mode also works better in the case of the POCO phone. However, in the case of selfies, the Nokia handset gets an edge as the images capture more details.                 
 The Nokia 7 Plus was the first smartphone in India to draw power from Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 660 chipset. Carrying that legacy forward, the 8.1 is the second device in the subcontinent to come equipped with the Snapdragon 710 SoC. The chip brings several flagship features from the SD8xx series, including the power-efficient 10nm fabrication process. The octa-core silicon features custom-built Kryo 360 architecture which has two quad-core clusters running at 2.2GHz and 1.7GHz, respectively. For graphics, Snapdragon 710 comes integrated with Adreno 616 GPU. The hardware ensures incredibly smooth performance, which is also likely due to the fact that the smartphone is part of Android One and runs the latest iteration of Google’s mobile OS, i.e. 9.0 Pie. There’s zero bloatware in the OS, and apart from the custom camera app (described above), all the apps in the device are stock. The Nokia 8.1 also offers swift multitasking, thanks to 4GB of RAM.  But all the aforesaid stuff probably won’t make any difference to you if the phone can’t let you scream ‘winner winner, chicken dinner’, right? I’m happy to report that you’d be doing that often (if you’re proficient in PUBG, unlike me) as the phone plays the title in high settings and runs it without issues. Sadly however, the device is unable to keep thermals under control. It gets noticeably hot while playing a game for more than 15 minutes. And while that can probably be given a pass, the handset even got warm with normal usage like streaming a video on 4G with GPS being enabled for navigation purposes.  On the storage side of things, the Nokia 8.1 ships with 64GB memory onboard. And if that’s not enough, then you can top it up by another 400GB with the use of a microSD card, but you’ll need to sacrifice on the dual-SIM functionality to do that. While Nokia prides itself on the stereo speakers on some of its smartphones, it’s strange to see a single, teeny speaker at the base of the 8.1 Not only is the sound output nothing to write home about, the speaker also gets covered while playing games or watching videos in the landscape orientation. 
 One of the biggest hallmarks of the Nokia 7 Plus was its battery life as it shipped with a 3,800mAh cell. The Nokia 8.1 also aims to continue in the same vein, although it comes with a slightly smaller 3,500mAh battery. However, when combined with the power-efficient processor, you get similar battery life, if not better. Strangely however, in our battery test wherein we play an HD video on loop with both the brightness and volume set at 50 percent levels, the phone was only able to run 11 hours, which is just about average. In real-life however, the smartphone usually had about 20 to 25 percent by the end of the day. The screen-on time is also quite impressive as I got around more than four and a half hours on more than one occasion.

2259,30,30388,3.5,5,2017-06-15,,30388,Prateek Pandey -,OPPO F3 review: selfie therapy on a budget,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oppo-f3-review?pid=30388," “OPPO’s F3 smartphone touts the same selfie cameras which made the F3 Plus compelling” It’s no secret that Chinese smartphone manufacturers have taken over a huge chunk of the Indian smartphone business. You’ve got brands like Xiaomi and OnePlus which are offering raw performance equivalent to what you might find on a high-end Samsung smartphone. Similarly, on the camera front, brands like OPPO and Vivo have taken the market by a storm with their selfie-centric smartphone offerings. We recently reviewed one such smartphone from OPPO dubbed the F3 Plus (review) which boasted a dual-camera setup on the front. Now, the company is back with a stripped-down and more compact version of the same device at a more affordable price point, called the OPPO F3 (first impressions). But does it pack enough grunt to find a place in your pockets? I’ll be answering this question and much more in this review of the OPPO F3. Stay with me.  One of the biggest differentiators between the OPPO F3 Plus and the OPPO F3 is the size. The OPPO F3 Plus is a phablet and packs a massive 6-inch display. On the contrary, the OPPO F3 sports a much smaller footprint and comes with a 5.5-inch display. Understandably, the smaller dimensions of the F3 make it a lot more manageable and despite not having very large hands, I faced no issues reaching the far corners of the smartphone while holding it with one hand. However, other than the screen size, the F3 is identical to the F3 Plus in terms of design. Matter of fact, the company has been consistent in terms of aesthetics for most of its smartphones. But unless you are a returning OPPO customer, the monotonous design language won’t be the biggest thorn in your side. Moving on, the handset has been constructed out of metal, which coupled with its sleek girth, gives the device a rather premium feel. There’s a right mix of rounded edges and chamfered layers which further contribute to the smartphone’s good looks. Mind you, the F3 is slippery, although that’s a trade-off you’ll have to make with any metallic smartphone.
The power button has been placed on the right side of the handset and the volume rockers can be found on the left. The capacitive home button, which also houses a fingerprint sensor, can be found below the screen, with the top reserved for the dual selfie shooters, the earpiece and some sensors. The fingerprint sensor is one of the fastest I’ve seen on a smartphone and is extremely accurate as well. Also, the OPPO F3 comes with a dual-SIM card tray which can also fit in a microSD card. Therefore, you can expand the internal storage without sacrificing a SIM card slot. Suffice it to say, the OPPO F3 has been nicely built and the design, albeit a bit standardised, is really appealing. Talking about the display of the smartphone, the handset comes with a 5.5-inch full HD IPS panel which has good viewing angles. The colours did appear slightly saturated to my eyes, but they didn’t dampen the experience of using the smartphone. I was satisfied with the display’s legibility in broad daylight too. Much like most other Chinese OEMs, OPPO also ships its smartphones with a custom skin built over Android, called ColorOS in this case. The F3 runs Android Marshmallow with a layer of ColorOS v3.0 on top. However, with this far into 2017, I expected the smartphone to run at least Android Nougat v7.0. The company sort of makes up for it by bundling the Google Assistant with the F3. Users also get the standard frills associated with a custom skin such as a theme store which, by the way, is loaded with some great wallpapers… so if you are a fan of customising your home screens, make sure to check it out. As expected, there’s no app drawer and all your apps are laid out on the home screen so if you happen to have a ton of applications on your phone, I recommend you use a custom launcher which should help you declutter your home screen.   Thankfully, there’s little-to-no bloatware on the OPPO F3 and the smartphone just ships with Google’s essential suite of applications along with some third-party apps like Facebook and Instagram. There are some other notable additions to the software too, such as the built-in Security app which can clear up your RAM and help you fend off malware. The smartphone also comes with support for screen-off gestures which can be activated even when the screen is locked. For instance, drawing an ‘O’ will launch the camera and so on. The OPPO F3 packs an octa-core MediaTek MT6750T processor which works in tandem with 4GB of RAM and has 64GB of onboard storage which can be expanded by inserting a microSD card. There’s no denying the fact that the OPPO F3 is underpowered as compared to the F3 Plus, which gets a Snapdragon 653 octa-core SoC instead. However, I won’t get into the ‘Snapdragon is better than MediaTek’ debate because at the end of the day, what matters is how the smartphone performs in real life. And as far as the OPPO F3 is concerned, I am happy to report that the smartphone manages to hold its own when it comes to daily tasks. I am a heavy multitasker and constantly switch between apps, and I faced little-to-no lag while transitioning between different applications. Despite running a heavy skin on top of Android, the UI animations weren’t jittery either. Having said that, the gaming performance of the smartphone is subpar, and although I didn’t come across any noticeable frame drops while playing games like Clash Royale and Asphalt Nitro, heavier titles like Unkilled did require me to tone down the settings to get playable frame rates. Moreover, the smartphone can’t really hold apps in memory, and switching back and forth between heavy apps like Snapchat resulted in the apps being reloaded. Unlike its elder sibling, the OPPO F3 doesn’t have any heating issues. The device did get warm when I was setting it up initially, but that’s the case with every other smartphone. So long as you don’t use your smartphone as your primary gaming device, the OPPO F3 won’t give you any problems.    As far as the multimedia performance of the device is concerned, the OPPO F3 did a pretty good job. Towards the underside of the smartphone, buyers will find the single speaker unit which gets sufficiently loud. The 3,000mAh battery lasted me a full day with approximately 10 percent battery to spare towards the end of the night. The smartphone did a decent job at our battery test too, and lasted approximately 12.5 hours on a constant video loop. The biggest drawback buyers will notice with the OPPO F3 is that the smartphone doesn’t come with the company’s famed VOOC fast charging technology. Therefore, you’ll be stuck next to a wall charger for a good 2-3 hours before you can head out of your home with the smartphone at a 100 percent battery level.  OPPO has been innovating a lot on the camera front and has acquired a good reputation for itself with its selfie-centric smartphones. With the OPPO F3, buyers get a similar camera setup on the front as the F3 Plus comprising a pair of 16MP and 8MP shooters. On the back, the camera on the F3 is a step down from its elder sibling in terms of pixel count. While the F3 Plus ships with a 16MP sensor, the F3 comes with a 13MP one instead. The dual front cameras on the F3 enable you to capture wide-angle selfies. While the 16MP sensor up front captures selfies with incredible details, the 8MP sensor comes into play when you must squeeze a friend or two in the selfie with you.  Towards the rear, buyers will find the 13MP primary camera which sports a 1/3-inch sensor and supports PDAF, allowing the smartphone to focus comfortably even on moving subjects. There’s a f/2.2 aperture lens on the F3, which on paper is a considerable downgrade from the f/1.7 lens present on the bigger F3 Plus. In layman terms, a bigger aperture will let more light in and therefore, the camera would be a better performer in low light scenarios. Matter of fact, the company claimsthat the extra wide f/1.7 aperture lets in 60 percent more light than a traditional f/2.2 aperture lens. Moreover, while the F3 Plus comes with a dual-tone LED flash module, the F3 gets a single LED flash unit. There’s also no OIS support either this time around and the maximum resolution for video recording has capped at 1080p as opposed to 4K on the F3 Plus. Clearly, OPPO has made a lot of omissions on the F3 to bring its price down and although the smartphone doesn’t pack as good specs as its elder sibling, it still manages to crunch out some stellar photos. But before we get into that, let’s look at the camera app.   There are several different modes for users to choose from, including a GIF mode which will let you create a short 3-second clip. Unfortunately, if there’s a lot of movement going on, then the final render of the GIF will be extremely shaky. There’s also a double-exposure mode, which allows you to get creative with your photography skills and stitches two separately clicked images together. Lastly, the Ultra HD mode shoots several images consecutively and then stitches them together to churn out a 50MP high-res image. And no, it’s not a gimmick and does indeed increase the level of detail in a photo. I can definitely see landscape photographers making the most of this mode to capture some high-res sunsets. For the pros in the audience, OPPO has bundled an expert mode too, which will let you take control of the camera’s ISO levels, exposure settings and much more. 
 Talking about the camera performance, the selfies I captured with the 16MP front camera looked great and had incredible details too. They were slightly saturated, as is evident from the sample pictures I have added, but not so much so as to be a deal breaker for anyone. I also noticed that the 16MP sensor managed to capture a lot more details than the 8MP one. Therefore, if you are out and about with your friends, bear in mind that getting everyone in the frame will cost you some details. Moreover, while there’s no dedicated flash module for the front facing sensors, OPPO has bundled a screen flash functionality. As a result, clicking pictures in low-light will take its toll on the details but the selfies should still be passable by social media standards. Much like most other selfie-centric smartphones in the market, the OPPO F3 gets a beauty mode too. There are two settings users can play with here. First and foremost is the fairness slider, which can be used to give a rosy texture to your face. The other can be used to remove blemishes and dark circles. Moreover, the Beauty mode also doubles up as a Bokeh mode, simulating a depth of field effect in your selfies. Neat stuff. Lastly, users constantly on video calls will appreciate support for 1080p recording on the front facing camera too. There are some other software-based tweaks which enrich the selfie-shooting experience. For instance, the F3’s camera is smart enough to tell you to switch to the wide angle lens if three or more faces are detected in the frame. 
As far as the rear-facing camera is concerned,  the pictures I clicked in broad daylight were rich in detail and had sufficient dynamic range too. Shooting in HDR mode does increase the contrast ratio of the pictures but it isn’t overpowering, which is why in my usage, I left the setting turned on while clicking pictures as it made the pictures pop ever so slightly. The camera does a fine job of capturing macros too and I managed to capture some detailed and colour accurate close-ups of flowers as well. The 13MP sensor focusses quickly and for the most part, accurately too. As expected, images clicked in low light without flash turned out noisy and unusable. However, the smartphone managed to capture plenty of details with the flash assisting in low light. The biggest drawback of shooting with the F3’s primary camera is that the video has been capped at 1080p. Moreover, since there’s no OIS support either, the final footage will be quite shaky.  There are some sacrifices OPPO has made to make the F3 an affordable smartphone. Compared to the F3 Plus, buyers miss out on the faster Snapdragon chipset, a superior primary camera which supports 4K video, as well as the company’s VOOC fast charging tech. However, even without the slightly faster SoC, the F3 wasn’t a lag-fest. The primary camera would’ve been greatly benefited with 4K video recording support but during my testing period, I didn’t find myself looking for other phones to click pictures with. The lack of VOOC quick charging is a bummer, but the F3 somewhat makes up for it by offering stellar battery life and standby times. The F3 isn’t an outright winner, but for its asking price, it does get a lot of things right. Buyers can also look at the Moto G5 Plus (review) in this price range, which offers a vanilla Android experience, a faster processor, and a great rear camera, but misses out on the selfie goodness of the OPPO F3. "
2090,30,32343,3.5,5,2018-03-30,,32343,Shekhar Thakran -,OPPO F7 review: the latest crusader of the notch brigade,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oppo-f7-review?pid=32343," Apple’s iPhone X (review) has inspired a surprising number of Android handset makers who are now launching their own smartphones with the famous (or infamous) display notch. OPPO is latest to join the bandwagon as the company has launched its new F7 smartphone with a taller-than-usual screen aspect ratio of 19:9, and a cut-out at the top that acts as home to the front camera and proximity sensor. Considering this is one of the most affordable smartphones that is currently offering these features, is OPPO F7 (first impressions) merely an attempt to join the hype or a promising offering? Read our full review to find out.In terms of design, the OPPO F7 comes with a glossy back with a glass-like finish and a compact body. The handset does not feel unwieldy in the hand despite its large display, thanks to the edge-to-edge design. It’s fairly light in terms of weight too. However, as the back is glossy, the handset does feel slippery at times. The fingerprint scanner is conveniently placed in the middle at the back and is easily accessible. The volume rocker and power buttons are respectively placed on the left and right side of the smartphone. The speaker grille and a 3.5mm headphone jack are located at the bottom. Unfortunately, it’s very easy to block the speaker with your palm and muffle the audio while watching videos.  Coming to the display, let us address the notch in the room. The presence of the display cut out hardly bothered us 5 minutes into using the OPPO F7. However, we will like to point out that there are issues while watching movies (in fit-to-screen mode) as part of the content is covered by the notch. To add to the woes, most of the apps on Google Play, unlike the ones on iOS, have still not been optimised to embrace the notch. As Google has now offered notch support in the developer preview of Android P, we can expect to see more apps getting optimised for the notch going ahead. In the end, it entirely depends on you whether you feel the notch is a deal breaker or not. In any case, you will have to make this decision before purchasing the smartphone. For what it’s worth, the presence of the notch does make the F7 stand out from the crowd (at least for now) and could act as a head turner as well as a conversation starter .If we talk about the quality of the display itself, we found that the 6.3-inch FHD+ panel on the F7 performs really well and gets bright enough to be used in daylight too. The viewing angles, as well as the colour reproduction on the display, are both pretty impressive. Here’s a closer look at the smartphone via the gallery below.
 Moving on to the optics, while the company is not offering a dual camera module (which has become fairly common across different price segments), the rear-facing sensor on the OPPO F7 managed to click some impressive pictures for us. The handset allows users to put AR stickers on faces as well as take pictures in panorama mode. The ‘Expert’ mode is essentially an equivalent of the Pro mode available in other smartphones and allows users to adjust the shutter speed, EV, and ISO among other options to click pictures as per their preferences. While the rear camera did take images with a good amount of detail in brightly-lit outdoor conditions, even in low-light, it managed to snap some impressive pictures.Talking about the front camera, the company boasts that the 25-megapixel sensor tracks 296 facial spots to offer realistic selfies on the basis of age, gender, etc. While the front camera also managed to take some really good pictures for us, the bokeh effect was not a stand-out offering. The camera often poses exposure issues and lens flare issues only make matters worse. However, when it works, the front camera on OPPO F7 is capable of taking some really good pictures even in low-light conditions and with a great amount of detail, just like the rear camera. Here are some image samples clicked with OPPO F7.
 The OPPO F7 runs Android 8.1 Oreo-based ColorOS v5.0 out of the box and while the custom UI does not have excessive bloatware, the company has offered some neat features that work towards improving the utility of the operating system. The first thing you will note about the software features that are meant to make navigation easier will be that OPPO has taken inspiration from the iOS implementation on the iPhone X. This means you can choose the preferred gesture layout and then swipe up from any app to go to the home screen, and swipe up from the bottom of the screen and hold to bring up recent tasks. Interestingly, unlike iOS, OPPO has provided four gesture layout options to users. If the gestures seem too cumbersome, you can choose the ‘Virtual Key Navigation’ option to get virtual keys for Recents, Home, and Back.You can use the three-finger-swipe gesture in the upward direction to bring up multitasking in the apps that support the functionality by choosing the option from the settings menu. Swiping down with three fingers can be used to take a screenshot. Users can choose the app encryption feature to ensure the safety of the apps they want to protect by hiding their Home screen icon. Interestingly, the company has introduced a data sharing tool called OPPO Share that allows users to share images, videos, and other files without consuming cellular data with other phones from the company. OPPO claims that this feature is capable of transferring data at a speed 100 times faster than Bluetooth.  The F7 comes with a Game Acceleration mode that allows the handset to identify the status of the game to allocate more memory resources, reduce network latency and provide a stable gaming performance. With this feature turned on, notifications from WhatsApp, Messenger, and other third-party apps are blocked when users are playing games. Lastly, there is Smart Assistant, which can be brought up by simply swiping left from the home screen, and provides users with information including their daily step count, recent itinerary, and more. In landscape mode while watching videos, users get the option to block banner notifications, record the screen, and take a screenshot. The Face Unlock feature allows users to unlock the handset by registering their face and just holding up the smartphone up to their fascia. Interestingly, this particular feature was found to be slightly inconsistent in our testing as it worked perfectly well on most occasions but failed badly in some others. However, this is something that can be easily improved substantially by the company with future software updates. It’s worth pointing out that on occasions when the handset managed to register the faces properly, it unlocked even in poorly-lit surroundings. During our testing, the OPPO F7 managed to deliver impressive performance as the smartphone handled graphically intensive tasks with ease. The MediaTek Helio P60 processor enables the smartphone to perform split-screen multitasking without breaking into sweat. The handset houses a 3,400mAh battery and managed to last around 17 hours in our video loop test where we play an HD video with the volume set to 50 percent levels. As the handset offers an impressive display and good battery life, it can prove to be a worthy multimedia device.   The OPPO F7 has been launched by the company at a starting price of Rs 21,990. In this price range, the handset will be competing against the likes of the Vivo V9 (review) and the Moto X4 (review). However, Vivo V9 offers a slightly better camera and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro offers better value for money as an overall package. While the F7 does fare well in many aspects, if it was priced more competitively, it would have been easier to recommend the smartphone. However, as of now, the novelty of the notch and the stylish design might be the primary reasons to buy this handset. "
2241,30,32793,,,2018-09-07,,32793,Shekhar Thakran -,OPPO F9 Pro Review: a stylish phone that could do with some more horsepower,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/oppo-f9-pro-review?pid=32793," “The OPPO F9 Pro comes with extremely capable cameras that take good pics under apt lighting conditions” Over the last few years, OPPO has become a household name in India. The brand’s presence has grown substantially in the country and we have already seen multiple OPPO phones launched this year across price ranges. Notably, most of the new phones under the brand featured a notch display design. With the all-new OPPO F9 Pro (first impressions), the Chinese company has completely revamped the implementation of the notch design to offer more screen-to-body ratio than most other phones out there.  For better or for worse, the OPPO F9 Pro looks somewhat similar to the brand’s other handsets like the A3s and A5, at least from the rear. The F9 Pro has been launched in Twilight Blue and Sunrise Red colours in India. The blue variant is rather subtle and does not stand out, unless put under direct sunlight, where you would be able to see a rhombus-shaped pattern at the back. On the other hand, the Sunrise Red model will immediately grab eyeballs. The F9 Pro ships with a glass sandwich design and has a glossy finish on the sides. The pill-shaped fingerprint sensor is placed slightly above the middle at the rear, right above the branding, and sits nicely beneath the index finger when using the phone with one hand.The dual camera module is located on the top left, assisted by an LED on the right side. The LED module has been placed inside a metallic frame, which looks slightly odd. The power button is located on the right side and the volume buttons are located on the left, which means you can easily take screenshots with just one hand as well. The buttons are all easily accessible, which seems to be the case with most smartphones these days.There is a SIM card slot on the left spine and the bottom of the handset consists of a 3.5mm headphone jack, a micro-USB charging port (we were hoping for a USB Type-C port, given the mid-range pricing of this phone), and a speaker grille. In regular usage, the glass back on the handset turned out to be a fingerprint magnet and the metallic sides make the handset a tad bit slippery.  Now let’s talk about the most interesting aspect of the phone – the display design. OPPO F9 Pro comes with a waterdrop notch design, which essentially houses just the front camera, with the earpiece located right above the camera sensor. This definitely helps the handset in offering an amazing screen-to-body aspect ratio without going for a motorised component like the Vivo NEX (review) or the OPPO Find X. In our time with the phone, we found that the smaller notch feels odd at first but once you get used to it, there are no issues whatsoever. While watching videos, you will actually be glad that the notch does not end up taking a whole lot of the screen’s real estate. Here’s a closer look at the phone’s design:
 The F9 Pro packs a 6.3-inch FHD+ display with a screen resolution of 2,340 x 1,080 pixels. Without a doubt, the F9 Pro comes with one of the most vibrant panels on the phones that we have reviewed recently. The display comes across as sharp but the peak brightness levels can sometimes prove to be an issue. In our time with the handset, we faced slight trouble seeing the screen contents in outdoor conditions under the sun. The viewing angles are good, in case you are concerned. If you like watching movies or music videos on your phone all the time, you won’t be disappointed by the F9 Pro.A good phone needs to get its cameras right, and there are no two ways about it. Before we talk about the camera performance offered by the OPPO F9 Pro, let’s get the specifications out of the way. The handset comes with a dual camera setup at the rear, consisting of a primary 16MP sensor and a 2MP secondary sensor, assisted by an LED flash. At the front, you get a high-res 25MP sensor for taking selfies and video calling. There is no LED flash on the front, but you do get a screen flash feature to help with shooting selfies in dim lighting. Now that we have talked about the specs on paper, let’s discuss the real-world performance. The dual camera setup on the F9 Pro manages to take some really good pictures, with detail and good dynamic range, given that it is provided with apt lighting conditions. The low-light performance offered by the phone is not exactly a benchmark as there is some noise in the images. However, in most other conditions, the F9 Pro ended up taking some brilliant pictures. Things get even better when we move to the selfie camera. To put it simply, the F9 Pro might just have one of the best selfie cameras in its price range, which is not a small statement. The front camera captures amazing detail without compromising on the skin tone. As OPPO has been a strong player in the selfie camera smartphones, it does not come as a surprise that the F9 Pro carries forward the brand’s reputation in the performance offered by front-facing cameras.The default camera app on the F9 Pro comes integrated with the Google Lens, which allows you to scan text, shop for things online, and discover things online using the handset’s camera. You get various modes including Portrait, Sticker, Slo-mo, Time-lapse, Pano, and Expert. The Expert mode, as you might have guessed already, works similar to the Pro mode found in other phones and allows for you to adjust the ISO and white balance among other things.There is an AI-assisted beauty mode that features levels from 1 to 6. Modes like Super Vivid and HDR are also there, available directly in the camera viewfinder. Right beside the beauty mode option, you also get different filters to choose from. In the video mode, you can shoot the clips in up to 1080p resolution. Here are some camera samples:
 The OPPO F9 Pro is powered by a MediaTek Helio P60 processor, coupled with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of built-in storage, which can be expanded by up to 256GB via a microSD card. To give you a better perspective, the base variant of Realme 1 is currently priced at Rs 8,999 and features the same processor. Keeping that in mind, the F9 Pro could have been equipped with a more powerful processor by the company. Having said that, we did not face any major issues in terms of the actual performance offered by the smartphone. We managed to play PUBG, which can be particularly demanding at times, at medium graphics settings with ease. At high graphics settings, the smartphone presented some stutter issues but the game still remained playable.The handset runs Android 8.1 Ore-based ColorOS v5.2 out of the box. There is a Game Space feature, which works towards optimising the phone’s gaming performance by freeing up some memory and offering graphics acceleration. Similarly, just as you would expect from the company’s proprietary OS, you get some preloaded utility tools, smart assistant, and security features like Kids Space and Private Safe. There are toggles for Google Assistant, Calculator, and some other utility tools as well in the notification shade.  This has been said in abundance but in order to get rid of notifications, you need to swipe first and then tap on the bin icon, which is an extra step that is not required in most other UIs out there. If you are moving to the F9 Pro from iOS or a stock Android phone, these small things might end up annoying you while using the phone in general.  The OPPO F9 Pro houses a sizeable 3,500mAh battery, which has almost become a standard size for the smartphones with 6-inch or larger displays. For us, the F9 Pro managed to last a day of normal usage with ease, thanks to the background app management offered by the handset.  In our HD video loop test, the smartphone managed to last around 16 hours, which is an impressive feat by all means. This means, if you like to travel a lot and watch movies on road, the F9 Pro can serve to be a great companion. To sum the review up, the OPPO F9 Pro offers good camera performance and display quality. The waterdrop notch design is an interesting way of delivering a good screen-to-body ratio and this implementation works in favour of the smartphone. However, if we look at the competition, the POCO F1 (review) and Honor Play (review) come with much better processors in the same price range. Vivo’s V11 Pro (review) has a similar waterdrop display design like the OPPO F9 Pro, and trumps the latter with a better processor too. Even though the F9 Pro has a lot going for it, the value-for-money offered by the first handset from Xiaomi’s sub-brand POCO and the gaming smartphone from Honor trumps the OPPO offering with ease. If the handset featured a better processor, the F9 Pro could have given the other offerings a run for their money but in the current state, we are definitely left asking for more.

The company’s presence in the offline market is beyond question but now the brand is aiming to woo online customers as well. As part of this new strategy, the company has introduced an online-exclusive brand called Realme. The first smartphone from this lineup, called the Realme 1, has just been launched by the company, and we’ve already spent quality time with the handset to understand what it truly offers. To find out if the Realme 1 is actually worth its bucks, read on our detailed review.Without a shadow of a doubt, the Diamond Black pattern at the back of Realme 1 is an eye-catcher. The glass back is definitely a fingerprint magnet but the handset manages to stand out from the flood of smartphones that feature metallic backs. The Realme 1, despite its large screen size, is easy to hold even with one hand. The volume rocker and power button are conveniently placed on the right side of the handset while the SIM slot is at the left side of the smartphone. The rear camera setup is placed on the top left at the rear and notably, the fingerprint sensor and home button are absent on the Realme 1. The 3.5mm headphone jack is placed beside the bottom-firing speakers and micro-USB charging port. The Realme 1 comes with a 6-inch FHD+ (2,160 x 1,080 pixel) display with the modern standard aspect ratio of 18:9. The handset features narrow bezels at top and bottom of the display and there is no home button at front, as mentioned earlier. While the display on the smartphone is acceptable in terms of quality, unfortunately, the display’s maximum brightness let us down. In outdoor conditions, we struggled to see the content on the display as the highest brightness levels are nowhere near satisfactory. Otherwise, the colours don’t look oversaturated and the narrow bezels are easy on the eyes. Here’s a closer look at the design.
 If we talk about optics on the new offering by OPPO, the Realme 1 comes with a single 13-megapixel rear-facing primary camera and an 8-megapixel selfie shooter. In the default camera app, users get various options including the option to shoot time-lapse videos, and clicking pictures with stickers or in panorama and expert modes. In the expert mode, users get to adjust ISO and shutter speed to click pictures. You can click pictures with a timer as well as in HDR mode. In our testing, we found that the handset managed to click decent pictures in outdoor conditions with apt lighting conditions, though the images clicked by both rear and front cameras lacked detail. The pictures clicked by the rear camera seemed soft as soon as we zoomed into them for a closer look. Again low-light pictures looked good as long as we did not zoom into them, for the lack of details.  In conclusion, the Realme 1 offers an acceptable camera performance but based on its performance in our review, we would say that the smartphone did not deliver overly impressive pictures. You can be your own judge by looking at our camera sample gallery right below:
 OPPO’s new smartphone is powered by MediaTek MT6771 Helio P60 processor coupled with 6GB of RAM. As you might have guessed from the specs on paper, the handset packs in a lot of horsepower. The Realme 1 managed to run most apps and games on the Google Play store with ease and even multitasking did not pose any problems for the smartphone. Thanks to OPPO Game Acceleration, the company claims that the handset can optimise the display configuration to fully utilise the hardware resources. However, the best feature that comes along with OPPO Game Acceleration is that users can block banner notifications and sound alerts while playing games. We faced some heating issues while playing particularly demanding games but nothing too concerning.  Overall, the smartphone doesn’t let users down in terms of performance and manages to breeze through most of its way. Moving on to the software, the Realme 1 runs Android 8.1 Oreo-based ColorOS 5.0 out of the box, without too much bloatware. There are plenty of customisable options available for users. Users get an assistive ball, which works just like the Assistive Touch on iOS. The SmartSMS feature extracts key content from the messages, like flight or movie tickets, and displays them as cards to the users. For security, there is app encryption as well as a personal information protection feature, which prevents an app from getting access to users’ personal information. There is a ‘Nightly Shield’ to prevent eye strain and Clone Apps for those who like to use the same apps with two different accounts on the same handset. As the Realme 1 notably misses out on a fingerprint sensor, the company has offered Face Unlock feature as a solution for unlocking the handset in quick time. In our testing, we found that the facial recognition offered by the handset is lightning quick but not as secure as one might hope. Unfortunately, we were able to unlock the handset with our eyes closed and even with half a face covered with a hand. Needless to say, the passcode is the best security option available on the Realme 1 as of now. However, we would like to add that this feature can be improved by the company with future software updates.In our HD loop video test, the Realme 1, which houses a respectable 3,410mAh battery, managed to last 15 hours. This test involves running an HD video on loop till the smartphone’s battery percentage drops from 100 percent to 0, and logging the time. As per the performance of the battery, it is safe to say that Realme 1 can easily last a day on a single charge. It is also worth noting that the handset retains battery in an efficient manner in standby mode.  Priced at Rs 13,990 for the 6GB RAM variant, OPPO’s new Realme 1 seems like a handset that could have been a great option in the affordable segment, but falls short slightly, especially in the camera department. As we now have smartphones like Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 5 Pro (review) and the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 (review) in the same price range, we feel that OPPO can sort out some basic shortcomings with the Realme 1, possibly via software updates. The new phone is still worth considering if you’re in the marked for an affordably-priced daily driver that looks stylish and helps you turn heads wherever you go.      "

However, we would like to add that this feature can be improved by the company with future software updates.In our HD loop video test, the Realme 1, which houses a respectable 3,410mAh battery, managed to last 15 hours. This test involves running an HD video on loop till the smartphone’s battery percentage drops from 100 percent to 0, and logging the time. As per the performance of the battery, it is safe to say that Realme 1 can easily last a day on a single charge. It is also worth noting that the handset retains battery in an efficient manner in standby mode.  Priced at Rs 13,990 for the 6GB RAM variant, OPPO’s new Realme 1 seems like a handset that could have been a great option in the affordable segment, but falls short slightly, especially in the camera department. As we now have smartphones like Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 5 Pro (review) and the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 (review) in the same price range, we feel that OPPO can sort out some basic shortcomings with the Realme 1, possibly via software updates. The new phone is still worth considering if you’re in the marked for an affordably-priced daily driver that looks stylish and helps you turn heads wherever you go.      "
2355,30,32936,,,2018-09-27,,32936,Prateek Pandey -,Realme 2 Pro review: the real upgrade,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/realme-2-pro-review?pid=32936," “Here’s our take on Realme 2 Pro – the cheapest Android smartphone to ship with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 660 processor” In an attempt to offer more, Chinese smartphone manufacturers have started slotting their products into various sub brands. As an example, you could either opt for the pricey Huawei P20 Pro (review) or the affordable yet feature-rich Honor 10 (review). In a similar fashion, manufacturers like Xiaomi, iVoomi, and OPPO have also introduced their sub brands in the country, ensuring buyers are spoilt for choices.  Now, we already know that Xiaomi’s Poco F1 (review) was a runaway hit, but OPPO’s Realme 2 (review) raised a lot of eyebrows when it was first launched as it was a step down in terms of performance as compared to its predecessor, the Realme 1 (review). To set things right, the brand has just announced the Realme 2 Pro, which ships with significantly more powerful innards. So in this review, let’s take a look at what the smartphone brings to the table and if it is worthy of your hard-earned bucks. The Realme 2 Pro takes most of its design cues from its predecessor, the Realme 2. With the newer model, you’ll get the same glass-sandwich design which is held together by a rubberised frame with chamfered edges. Although the lack of a metallic trim makes the smartphone feel a lot less premium in the hand, the rubberised texture of the frame does wonders for your grip. My review unit of the Realme 2 Pro shipped in an all-black colourway and much to my dismay, the device omits the diamond-cut pattern on the back which made its predecessors the talk of the town.That said, the smartphone still looks quite good, so long as you can keep the back from smudging. Thankfully, the company does bundle a transparent case with the retail unit of the device which will allow you to flaunt the looks of the device whilst protecting it from accidental drops at the same time. While we are on the subject of the smartphone’s back, I should point out that the device also ships with a fingerprint sensor which worked flawlessly during my time with the phone. You can also use the built-in face unlock feature to unlock the device, which works equally well. Coming back to the fingerprint sensor, the unit has been positioned rather ergonomically, and it aligned perfectly with my index finger when I was operating the device with just one hand. On that note, the Realme 2 Pro is a joy to use single-handedly, thanks to its excellent weight distribution and a grippy design. Therefore, it’s going to take a lot more than a bump in a busy metro to knock the smartphone from your hands.   That’s not to say that the design of the smartphone is without its flaws. Within just a week of using the device, I noticed that the power button had lost its tactility. Moreover, the display doesn’t merge seamlessly into the frame of the device which drove me nuts during my time with the smartphone. I was also disappointed with the company’s decision to opt for a micro-USB port when the entire industry is switching to a USB Type-C port on their devices. Thankfully, the Realme 2 Pro ships with a gorgeous display which more than make up for the minor quibbles I had with the design of the device. The smartphone sports a 6.3-inch AMOLED panel which boasts excellent viewing angles and adequate peak brightness levels. What’s more, unlike some other affordable smartphones, I didn’t notice any weird colour shifts on the display of the Realme 2 Pro either.  While all that’s good and dandy, the star of the show has to be the smartphone’s dew-drop notch, the likes of which you might’ve seen on OPPO’s F9 Pro (review) or the Vivo V11 Pro (review). Unlike other notch-based devices, the dew-drop notch on the Realme 2 Pro looks quite elegant and doesn’t take up a huge chunk of the smartphone’s display. Consequently, the handset boasts an impressive screen-to-body ratio of 90.8 percent.Unfortunately, not all apps have been optimised to play well with the smartphone’s unique cutout. For instance, when you open the Amazon app, the phone will automatically mask the notch inside a black bar at the top of the display. What’s more, the ‘fake’ bezel has noticeable jagged edges too, which will undoubtedly trigger your OCD. Thankfully, this is a software issue which can be resolved by means of an OTA update, so I’ll keep you posted if anything changes in the near future. Let me tell you right off the gate – the Realme 2 Pro takes incredible pictures, second only to Xiaomi’s Mi A2 in its price segment. The smartphone ships with a 16MP selfie shooter with f/2.0 aperture towards the front, and comes with a dual-camera setup at the back. Now, while the primary shooter at the back features a 16MP, f/1.7 aperture, Sony IMX 398 sensor, the brand hasn’t disclosed any details about the assisting shooter. As per the company, the ‘‘secondary camera serves as a highly sensitive detector that is not involved in imaging. It is mainly tasked with measuring the spatial distance of photographed objects in the portrait mode.“  That said, I was extremely pleased with the quality of photos from the Realme 2 Pro. Much like OPPO’s offerings, the selfie camera on the Realme 2 Pro is a beast and the device captures excellent selfies with a ton of details. The colour reproduction is quite nice, provided you turn off the Beauty AI and the selfies I clicked with the device were evenly-exposed too. What’s more, despite not shipping with a dual-camera setup on the front, the smartphone can still click portrait selfies by some software trickery. The end result isn’t very flattering, as the blur effect creeps into the edges of the subject but it’s still a nice tool to have in your arsenal.                  The dual rear-cameras on the Realme 2 Pro are fantastic shooters too, albeit fall behind Xiaomi’s offering. Under ideal lighting conditions, I noticed that the Mi A2 handled dynamic range a lot better than the RealMe 2 Pro. While the Realme 2 Pro makes the scene appear more pleasing by boosting up the saturation, the Mi A2 clicked truer-to-life pictures. Furthermore, upon zooming in, the Mi A2 retained more details in the macros and it was quicker to focus on a subject too. Lastly, if you’re a night owl with a penchant for photography, then you should know that the Mi A2 is a far better shooter under lowlight scenarios. Here are some images shot using the Realme 2 Pro.
  With that said, if you do end up buying the Realme 2 Pro, then you won’t be disappointed with the handset’s camera prowess. The portrait mode on the handset is really good as it has a controlled and convincing blur effect. Turn the page over to landscape shots and you’ll be pleased with the details and the vibrancy of the image too. Moreover, unlike me, I’m sure your capture device is also going to be your display device. Therefore, so long as you’re not looking at the images you shot with the smartphone at a 150-percent crop, you probably won’t find many faults in the pictures.  Driving the performance on the smartphone is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 AIE octa-core processor which works alongside the Adreno 512 GPU. My review unit of the device shipped with a whopping 8GB of RAM and 128GB of UFS 2.1 storage, though you can pick the device up in 4GB/64GB and 6GB/64GB configurations too.  Unsurprisingly, the smartphone’s powerful specs translate into excellent day-to-day performance and I didn’t notice any hiccups during my time with the device. Apps opened swiftly, multi-tasking was fluid and navigating through the UI was buttery smooth too. I was pleased with the device’s RAM management as well, which allowed me to jump in and out of applications quickly without having to wait for them to load again. The Realme 2 Pro impressed me with its gaming capabilities too, and I managed to run PUBG at medium settings comfortably. Casual games like PigeonPop, Clash Royale and Leo’s Fortune were a walk in the park for the smartphone and everything considered, the Realme 2 Pro offers an excellent price to performance ratio.   For software, the smartphone runs Android Oreo 8.1 based ColorOS v5.2 out of the box. The overall interface remains the same as you might’ve witnessed on the brand’s previous offerings and therefore, I won’t go into too much depth here. Some notable features of the custom skin include the addition of a Smart Sidebar, which gives you quick access to various apps as well as some system shortcuts like screen recording. Overall, the software feels minimal, clean and doesn’t ship with a ton of bloatware, which makes it a win in my books.    The Realme 2 Pro sips juice from a 3,500mAh battery which lasted me a full day on heavy usage. And by that, I mean constantly texting friends on WhatsApp, staying connected on other social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook, listening to music for a good number of hours via Apple Music and watching some videos on YouTube. I threw in a couple sessions of Clash Royale too and yet, the smartphone still had around 20 percent of juice left by the time I hit the bed. For its starting price of Rs 13,990, the Realme 2 Pro is a solid smartphone. Not only is it the cheapest device to ship with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 660 processor, but it also offers an impressive display and capable cameras.   Now, if you are confused between Xiaomi’s Mi A2 (review) and the Realme 2 Pro, then ask yourself if you value battery life over cameras or vice-versa. While the Mi A2 is a better shooter, the smartphone’s battery life falls short of Realme’s offering. Everything considered, the Realme 2 Pro is a capable smartphone from the brand’s stables and consequently, gets a recommendation from me. Just make sure to pick up the 6GB RAM variant of the device which retails for Rs 15,990, as it should offer the same performance and will save you some hard-earned bucks. That is, unless you’re a sucker for 128GB of built-in memory and don’t mind shelling out Rs 17,990 for the device. "
2478,30,33249,4,5,2019-04-22,,33249,Prateek Pandey -,Realme 3 Pro review: the ‘Pro’ you should buy,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/realme-3-pro-review?pid=33249," “Our take on Realme’s latest affordable smartphone, the Realme 3 Pro”You might’ve heard the saying – better to have tried and failed than to have never tried at all. Well, I’m sure folks at Realme are glad they did because as it stands, the company’s short stint in India has been successful beyond measure. In fact, Realme is the single biggest threat to Xiaomi’s dominance in the budget and affordable segment as month after month, the brand has launched one compelling smartphone after another.  Can then, Realme’s latest smartphone, the Realme 3 Pro, stop the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro (review) from hogging up all the limelight in the affordable segment? To find out, I spent a week with the device in my pocket and after extensive testing, here’s what I concluded. The Realme 3 Pro is many things – a fantastic camera phone, a good performer, an all-day handset thanks to its impressive battery life but, a good-looking device it is not. Now, from a distance, the smartphone looks fine. You might even like it, quite honestly. But up close and in the hand, the device’s plastic chassis leaves a lot to be desired. Making matters worse, the Redmi Note 7 Pro’s all-glass frame makes the Realme 3 Pro feel cheap and tacky in comparison. Suffice it to say, the handset’s build will be a constant reminder that it is in fact, not a premium, high-end device.If you can look past the handset’s sub-par build quality, then you’ll find plenty to like about the Realme 3 Pro’s design. First and foremost, despite its gigantic size, the Realme 3 Pro offers excellent ergonomics, thanks in no small part to its curvy back which nestled perfectly in the palm of my hands. Furthermore, the power button and the volume rockers have been positioned at the middle of the device’s frame, making them easily accessible too. The capacitive fingerprint sensor, which can be found towards the back of the device, aligned perfectly with my index finger and it worked superbly as well. The sensor is extremely accurate and shockingly sensitive to the touch, which meant I could get inside my home screen in the blink of an eye. Having said that, the positioning of the headphone jack isn’t ideal for playing games or watching movies in landscape mode. You see, I constantly had to readjust my grip or flip the phone upside down whilst gaming as the earphone’s connector kept biting my palms. To that extent, I much prefer the positioning of the jack on the Redmi Note 7 Pro, which allowed me to game without any fuss. Moreover, the Realme 3 Pro ships with a micro-USB port for charging, which at first, irked me. But, seeing how the device charges faster than competing offerings with a USB Type-C port, I’m willing to give Realme a pass this time around.The only real drawback of the handset’s archaic micro-USB connector is that the data transfer speeds were noticeably slower as compared to a smartphone which shipped with a USB Type-C port. So, you might have to sit on your hands if you’re shifting big files to or from the phone’s storage.  The Realme 3 Pro’s window to the world is a 6.3-inch FHD+ panel which is plenty big and plenty sharp for enjoying movies on the fly. What’s more, unlike other devices in the same segment, the Realme 3 Pro’s display doesn’t exhibit a bluish tint when viewed at an angle. Moreover, the display gets adequately bright too and therefore, the content on the screen was legible enough even when I was using the smartphone outdoors.  It’s worth noting that the final retail units of the Realme 3 Pro will be coming with the Widevine L1 support. However, my review unit didn’t come with the same and hence I wasn’t able to stream licensed HD content from services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Brands like Huawei and Google have taken smartphone photography to the next level, which is why, there’s a lot riding on a smartphone’s camera nowadays. To that extent, the Realme 3 Pro doesn’t disappoint. The handset ships with a dual-camera setup at the back, comprising 16MP and 5MP sensors with f/1.7 and f/2.4 apertures respectively. For selfies, the device features a 25MP selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.impressive enough already, you’d be glad to know that the 16MP shooter at the back makes use of Sony’s IMX 519 sensor which is present on the pricier OnePlus 6T (review). Moreover, while the handset doesn’t make use of a Quad Bayer array to output photos in 48MP resolution akin to the Redmi Note 7 Pro, it allows buyers to stitch four 16MP photos together. Consequently, you can click a 64MP shot with the handset in expert mode, which is mind-baffling, to say the least.  Coming to the smartphone’s overall performance in the imaging department, I feel that it’s one of the best camera phones you can buy in this price segment. Don’t get me wrong, the Redmi Note 7 Pro is a fantastic shooter too, and everything said and done, both the devices are neck and neck when it comes to details in the photos. But, Realme’s punchier colour science won the day for me. I’ll break down my experience of using the smartphone’s camera so take a gander – 1 – The Realme 3 Pro’s 16MP primary shooter clicks excellent photos during the day which are flush with vibrant colours and details. Moreover, I quite liked the enhancements brought about by the device’s AI engine and consequently, I didn’t turn it off during my time with the phone. As can be seen from the shots I’ve attached, the Realme 3 Pro clicks beautiful landscapes, and the device’s cameras rarely ever made me want to shoot a scene again.
The handset boasts excellent dynamic range too, which is evident in two shots specifically – the wide landscape scene just outside my office where you can clearly see the details in the sky. The sensor also managed to bring out the details in the trees lurking in the background in the same picture beautifully. Moving on, in the corridor shot, you’ll notice that my focus point was the bright scene just outside the main door. Now, this is an extremely tricky shot to expose correctly and most smartphone cameras often darken the rest of the scene. However, the Realme 3 Pro managed to squeeze out every bit of detail from the shadows and kept both, the bright subject as well as the dark corridor appealing to the eyes.The 64MP shot is no gimmick either, mind you. I noticed that by stitching four shots together, the Realme 3 Pro could achieve a more balanced and evenly exposed image. As can be seen from the samples, the 16MP shot looks good albeit doesn’t bring out the details from the shadows all that much. However, with four shots stitched together, the image appears fuller and more complete. That said, if the source of light is behind you, then you’ll be hard-pressed to tell between a 64MP and a 16MP snap.  4- The 5MP depth sensor does a great job of differentiating the subject from the background too. As you can tell from the portrait shot, the Realme 3 Pro’s edge detection is on par with the competition and it only falters when the background is of the same colour as the subject. Case in point, my hair, which are blurry in the picture as they matched the black coloured background. That said, the company stated that the review units are running pre-released software and therefore, you can expect better bokeh photos when the finalised version of the firmware hits the device. 5 – I click an awful lot of selfies every day and therefore, I never compromise on the quality of a smartphone’s front-facing camera. Thankfully, the Realme 3 Pro’s 25MP selfie shooter is downright excellent and it never failed to impress me with its shots. With all the beautification features turned off, the selfies outputted by the handset’s camera exhibited natural skin tones and showcased a ton of details. As for portrait selfies, the handset struggled to create a convincing blur effect around unruly edges, so you might want to comb your hair before you take that particular shot.
The lowlight performance of both, the front as well as the rear facing cameras is also good for the price. The smartphone even features a ‘nightscape’ mode, the likes of which you might’ve seen on OnePlus’ and Google’s offerings. Therefore, even when it’s pitch dark outside, you will be able to get away with a serviceable image.7 – If you’re a fan of shooting slow-mo videos, then you’ll be glad to know that with the latest software update, you’ll be able to record videos at 960fps on the phone. As it stands, the Realme 3 Pro is the cheapest smartphone in the country to ship with that feature and if used correctly, you could get away with some impressive slow-mo footage with the phone.  When it comes to sheer performance, the Realme 3 Pro has the Redmi Note 7 Pro and other similarly-priced smartphones beat. Underneath its plastic chassis, the Realme 3 Pro is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 710 processor which – in the case of my review unit – worked alongside 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. That said, buyers on a budget can also opt for a 4GB/64GB or a  6GB/64GB variant of the smartphone.  Going by the handset’s spec-sheet, you’d be wise to assume that the Realme 3 Pro performs admirably. During my testing, I could comfortably play intensive titles like Asphalt 9 and PUBG on medium to high settings. In fact, unlike the Redmi Note 7 Pro, the Realme 3 Pro defaults PUBG at high settings, which is unheard of in this price segment. What’s more bizarre is that the in-game frame rates remained consistent through and through. Suffice it to say, you won’t be able to blame the phone for your shoddy gaming performance.  The handset’s stellar performance was evident in day to day usage too. Applications opened swiftly and thanks to the smartphone’s 6 gigs of memory, I could jump in and out of apps quickly without having to wait for them to load again and again. That’s despite running a custom skin on top of Android, mind you.  Speaking of which, the Realme 3 Pro boots the company’s ColorOS v6.0 on top of Android Pie. The skin is fairly minimalistic, though you’ll struggle to navigate your way around the menus if you’re coming from a device running stock Android. That being said, you do get a ton of nifty features with ColorOS, which you can use to enhance your overall user experience. Utilities like Private Safe let you hide your personal data, including photos and videos away from prying eyes. You can even clone certain applications and thereby run two instances of the same app simultaneously, which is extremely useful for buyers who have two different numbers on messaging apps like WhatsApp. Lastly, you can either use the virtual keys or opt for gesture-based navigation on the device. Realme has even bundled some other quick-action shortcuts with the phone, including a ‘three finger swipe down’ gesture to capture a screenshot and an assistive ball, the likes of which you might’ve seen on Apple’s iPhones and Xiaomi’s MIUI. Unfortunately, you don’t get a system-wide dark theme bundled with the device, so if you’re into that, you’ll have to slap a custom launcher on the phone.  Thankfully, you’ll be able to enjoy the Realme 3 Pro’s speedy performance an entire day before you have to charge the phone. The handset is fuelled by a 4,045mAh battery which unsurprisingly, lasted me a full day off a single charge. What’s more, unlike some other devices in the market, the Realme 3 Pro didn’t force quit background applications to conserve battery life either. To give you a better picture, the Realme 3 Pro lasted a whopping 17 hours in our battery drain test, which is an amazing result. The Realme 3 Pro starts at Rs 13,999 (the 6GB RAM variant costs Rs 16,999) and for the price, it directly competes with Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 7 Pro. Now, pound for pound, the Realme 3 Pro is a better smartphone as it offers a speedier CPU and a more vibrant display. Moreover, I suspect most buyers will probably slap a case on the phone to protect it from accidental damage, making the Realme 3 Pro’s plastic build a non-issue too.  As for cameras, both, the Realme 3 Pro as well as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro are brilliant shooters and you can’t go wrong with either one in your pockets. The battery life of the two contenders is more or less the same too, so ultimately, it all boils down to the price. Considering you’ll end up paying the same for both the smartphones, I don’t see why you’d want to opt for one which offers slower performance to boot.  While the Redmi Note 7 Pro is a fantastic smartphone, Realme’s latest offering has undoubtedly won this bout. The ball’s in Xiaomi’s court now and I’m excited to see what the company comes up with next.    "

2478,30,33249,4,5,2019-04-22,,33249,Prateek Pandey -,Realme 3 Pro review: the ‘Pro’ you should buy,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/realme-3-pro-review?pid=33249," “Our take on Realme’s latest affordable smartphone, the Realme 3 Pro”You might’ve heard the saying – better to have tried and failed than to have never tried at all. Well, I’m sure folks at Realme are glad they did because as it stands, the company’s short stint in India has been successful beyond measure. In fact, Realme is the single biggest threat to Xiaomi’s dominance in the budget and affordable segment as month after month, the brand has launched one compelling smartphone after another.  Can then, Realme’s latest smartphone, the Realme 3 Pro, stop the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro (review) from hogging up all the limelight in the affordable segment? To find out, I spent a week with the device in my pocket and after extensive testing, here’s what I concluded. The Realme 3 Pro is many things – a fantastic camera phone, a good performer, an all-day handset thanks to its impressive battery life but, a good-looking device it is not. Now, from a distance, the smartphone looks fine. You might even like it, quite honestly. But up close and in the hand, the device’s plastic chassis leaves a lot to be desired. Making matters worse, the Redmi Note 7 Pro’s all-glass frame makes the Realme 3 Pro feel cheap and tacky in comparison. Suffice it to say, the handset’s build will be a constant reminder that it is in fact, not a premium, high-end device.If you can look past the handset’s sub-par build quality, then you’ll find plenty to like about the Realme 3 Pro’s design. First and foremost, despite its gigantic size, the Realme 3 Pro offers excellent ergonomics, thanks in no small part to its curvy back which nestled perfectly in the palm of my hands. Furthermore, the power button and the volume rockers have been positioned at the middle of the device’s frame, making them easily accessible too. The capacitive fingerprint sensor, which can be found towards the back of the device, aligned perfectly with my index finger and it worked superbly as well. The sensor is extremely accurate and shockingly sensitive to the touch, which meant I could get inside my home screen in the blink of an eye. Having said that, the positioning of the headphone jack isn’t ideal for playing games or watching movies in landscape mode. You see, I constantly had to readjust my grip or flip the phone upside down whilst gaming as the earphone’s connector kept biting my palms. To that extent, I much prefer the positioning of the jack on the Redmi Note 7 Pro, which allowed me to game without any fuss. Moreover, the Realme 3 Pro ships with a micro-USB port for charging, which at first, irked me. But, seeing how the device charges faster than competing offerings with a USB Type-C port, I’m willing to give Realme a pass this time around.The only real drawback of the handset’s archaic micro-USB connector is that the data transfer speeds were noticeably slower as compared to a smartphone which shipped with a USB Type-C port. So, you might have to sit on your hands if you’re shifting big files to or from the phone’s storage.  The Realme 3 Pro’s window to the world is a 6.3-inch FHD+ panel which is plenty big and plenty sharp for enjoying movies on the fly. What’s more, unlike other devices in the same segment, the Realme 3 Pro’s display doesn’t exhibit a bluish tint when viewed at an angle. Moreover, the display gets adequately bright too and therefore, the content on the screen was legible enough even when I was using the smartphone outdoors.  It’s worth noting that the final retail units of the Realme 3 Pro will be coming with the Widevine L1 support. However, my review unit didn’t come with the same and hence I wasn’t able to stream licensed HD content from services like Netflix and Amazon Prime. Brands like Huawei and Google have taken smartphone photography to the next level, which is why, there’s a lot riding on a smartphone’s camera nowadays. To that extent, the Realme 3 Pro doesn’t disappoint. The handset ships with a dual-camera setup at the back, comprising 16MP and 5MP sensors with f/1.7 and f/2.4 apertures respectively. For selfies, the device features a 25MP selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture.impressive enough already, you’d be glad to know that the 16MP shooter at the back makes use of Sony’s IMX 519 sensor which is present on the pricier OnePlus 6T (review). Moreover, while the handset doesn’t make use of a Quad Bayer array to output photos in 48MP resolution akin to the Redmi Note 7 Pro, it allows buyers to stitch four 16MP photos together. Consequently, you can click a 64MP shot with the handset in expert mode, which is mind-baffling, to say the least.  Coming to the smartphone’s overall performance in the imaging department, I feel that it’s one of the best camera phones you can buy in this price segment. Don’t get me wrong, the Redmi Note 7 Pro is a fantastic shooter too, and everything said and done, both the devices are neck and neck when it comes to details in the photos. But, Realme’s punchier colour science won the day for me. I’ll break down my experience of using the smartphone’s camera so take a gander – 1 – The Realme 3 Pro’s 16MP primary shooter clicks excellent photos during the day which are flush with vibrant colours and details. Moreover, I quite liked the enhancements brought about by the device’s AI engine and consequently, I didn’t turn it off during my time with the phone. As can be seen from the shots I’ve attached, the Realme 3 Pro clicks beautiful landscapes, and the device’s cameras rarely ever made me want to shoot a scene again.
The handset boasts excellent dynamic range too, which is evident in two shots specifically – the wide landscape scene just outside my office where you can clearly see the details in the sky. The sensor also managed to bring out the details in the trees lurking in the background in the same picture beautifully. Moving on, in the corridor shot, you’ll notice that my focus point was the bright scene just outside the main door. Now, this is an extremely tricky shot to expose correctly and most smartphone cameras often darken the rest of the scene. However, the Realme 3 Pro managed to squeeze out every bit of detail from the shadows and kept both, the bright subject as well as the dark corridor appealing to the eyes.The 64MP shot is no gimmick either, mind you. I noticed that by stitching four shots together, the Realme 3 Pro could achieve a more balanced and evenly exposed image. As can be seen from the samples, the 16MP shot looks good albeit doesn’t bring out the details from the shadows all that much. However, with four shots stitched together, the image appears fuller and more complete. That said, if the source of light is behind you, then you’ll be hard-pressed to tell between a 64MP and a 16MP snap.  4- The 5MP depth sensor does a great job of differentiating the subject from the background too. As you can tell from the portrait shot, the Realme 3 Pro’s edge detection is on par with the competition and it only falters when the background is of the same colour as the subject. Case in point, my hair, which are blurry in the picture as they matched the black coloured background. That said, the company stated that the review units are running pre-released software and therefore, you can expect better bokeh photos when the finalised version of the firmware hits the device. 5 – I click an awful lot of selfies every day and therefore, I never compromise on the quality of a smartphone’s front-facing camera. Thankfully, the Realme 3 Pro’s 25MP selfie shooter is downright excellent and it never failed to impress me with its shots. With all the beautification features turned off, the selfies outputted by the handset’s camera exhibited natural skin tones and showcased a ton of details. As for portrait selfies, the handset struggled to create a convincing blur effect around unruly edges, so you might want to comb your hair before you take that particular shot.
The lowlight performance of both, the front as well as the rear facing cameras is also good for the price. The smartphone even features a ‘nightscape’ mode, the likes of which you might’ve seen on OnePlus’ and Google’s offerings. Therefore, even when it’s pitch dark outside, you will be able to get away with a serviceable image.7 – If you’re a fan of shooting slow-mo videos, then you’ll be glad to know that with the latest software update, you’ll be able to record videos at 960fps on the phone. As it stands, the Realme 3 Pro is the cheapest smartphone in the country to ship with that feature and if used correctly, you could get away with some impressive slow-mo footage with the phone.  When it comes to sheer performance, the Realme 3 Pro has the Redmi Note 7 Pro and other similarly-priced smartphones beat. Underneath its plastic chassis, the Realme 3 Pro is powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 710 processor which – in the case of my review unit – worked alongside 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage.

In fact, unlike the Redmi Note 7 Pro, the Realme 3 Pro defaults PUBG at high settings, which is unheard of in this price segment. What’s more bizarre is that the in-game frame rates remained consistent through and through. Suffice it to say, you won’t be able to blame the phone for your shoddy gaming performance.  The handset’s stellar performance was evident in day to day usage too. Applications opened swiftly and thanks to the smartphone’s 6 gigs of memory, I could jump in and out of apps quickly without having to wait for them to load again and again. That’s despite running a custom skin on top of Android, mind you.  Speaking of which, the Realme 3 Pro boots the company’s ColorOS v6.0 on top of Android Pie. The skin is fairly minimalistic, though you’ll struggle to navigate your way around the menus if you’re coming from a device running stock Android.

2490,30,33048,3.5,5,2018-10-30,,33048,Shekhar Thakran -,Realme C1 review: affordable but not cheap,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/realme-c1-review?pid=33048," “The Realme C1 will be directly competing against the Xiaomi Redmi 6A in this price range”The car is known for being the ‘cheapest car’ money could buy. Mind you, the car may or may not have been a worthy purchase, but its ‘cheap’ tag kind of overpowered everything else. That’s the tricky thing with affordable products… if the brand does not focus on getting the basics right, the consumer attention shifts from what the product brings along to the compromises made in the process. Does the Realme C1 (first impressions), the brand’s most affordable offering to date, manage to tackle this complicated task? Read my review down below to find out.  Nobody wants an affordable phone that looks cheap. This is particularly why the design on Realme C1, despite not being extraordinary by any means, is a strong point for the phone. In fact, the design is eerily similar to the one found on the brand’s top-of-the-line Realme 2 Pro. Alas, there’s no fingerprint sensor in this case. Apart from this clear telltale difference, the handset borrows most of its design cues from the Realme 2 Pro. This means you get a glass sandwich design with a dual camera setup at the back and Realme branding in the bottom half. If you like to take screenshots on your phone when using it with one hand, you would love the fact that the volume buttons are placed on the left side of the Realme C1 and the power key is placed on the right. You also get a dual-SIM tray with a separate slot for the microSD card. The speaker grille, the micro-USB charging port, and the 3.5mm audio jack are present at the bottom of the phone in this same order from left to right. When playing games or watching videos on the phone, you will invariably cover the speaker grille and this is a design compromise that we have come to accept from most recent phones In order to get a second opinion about the phone’s design and display quality, I took the Realme C1 in one hand and the Realme 2 Pro in the other and showed them both (from the front of course) to a colleague of mine for a test. In response to the question “which phone looks more premium?”, my colleague chose the Realme C1. This is not to say that the Realme C1 looks better than the Realme 2 Pro or that the display resolution does not matter. This test simply proves that from a certain distance, the quality in design and display looks very similar for both these handsets. Props to the brand for maintaining this design standard across price segments.  
When a phone as affordable as the Realme C1 comes with dual camera sensors at the back, I am usually a little skeptical before testing out the optics. This is mostly because there are many examples where the implementation has been done just for the sake of it. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the camera performance offered by the phone. To get the specifications out of the way first, the rear-facing dual camera setup on the C1 consists of a primary 13MP sensor and a secondary 2MP shooter, with PDAF and HDR support. The front camera, a 5MP unit with f/2.2 aperture, comes with an AI beautification mode.In the default camera app, you are greeted by familiar options like Panorama and Time-lapse, apart from Auto. However, there is no Manual or Pro mode, which essentially allows you to adjust ISO and white balance levels before taking a picture. Most recent phones have this mode and if you are someone who likes to tweak these settings before clicking a picture, this absence is something you should keep in mind before buying the Realme C1.  Now, this is what you need to know about the camera. The details captured by the handset in low-light conditions are underwhelming. However, in outdoor conditions during the daytime, you can expect the phone to take some decent shots. The dynamic range is acceptable but not out of the ordinary. In comparison with the Redmi 6A, which also performed well in well-lit conditions, the phone performed neck-to-neck with the Xiaomi offering. When clicking pictures with AI beautification off, there is still some smoothening going on as the front sensor does a poor job of capturing accurate skin tone and details.  There is no LED flash at the front, unlike the back panel, but the screen lights up when you choose the flash option to help you click slightly better selfies in poor lighting conditions.  Shooting videos is not a fun joyride either as the clips turn out to be very shaky in general. You will be able to shoot videos at up to 1080p resolution with the Realme C1. Overall, for its price range, the Realme offering presents decent camera features and manages to click good pictures, though it does not leave a special mark for itself in this category.
Following the footsteps of other phones from Realme, the C1 runs ColorOS 5.1 based on Android 8.1 Oreo, and provides the same set of features and utility tools to the users as the other handsets in the series. For those of you who have not used ColorOS before, you get certain pre-installed apps but there is not much bloatware. With the Game Space feature, you will be able to manage different aspects of the phone like banner notifications and apply brightness lock from a single place. You can also choose to optimise the phone’s resources according to your gaming preferences. There are Smart Assistant and Quiet time features, which kind of work in the opposite direction, to provide you with plenty of information and help you manage the notifications, messages, and call settings when you need to cut yourself some slack, respectively.  To make up for the lack of a fingerprint sensor, there is a face unlock feature, which worked reasonably fast in the duration of my review. However, it is definitely not as secure as one would hope. I managed to unlock the phone with my face half covered and eyes closed, which is nowhere close to being an ideal security level.  Driving the performance on the phone is a Snapdragon 450 SoC, which can well be described as a trusted choice for performance requirements. Coupled with the processor, there is 2GB of RAM and 16GB of built-in storage, which is expandable up to 256GB via microSD card. In daily usage and navigating through the platform, I did not face any stutter or lag issues with the Realme C1. The animations remained smooth during the review period, although the app content can take a bit too much time to load up on certain occasions.  If you like gaming on your phone, you should not be looking phones in this price range but in case you want to occasionally play games like PUBG, the Realme C1 manages to run the game well at lowest graphics settings. There are still occasional hiccups but we are really pushing the phone well beyond its limits in these kinds of use cases. In casual apps and games, the Realme C1 runs smoothly and as we have a large battery on board, the phone holds up well in real life usage. Battery life ranks very high for most phone users’ priority list and thankfully, the Realme C1 doesn’t disappoint in this aspect. The handset packs in a massive 4,230mAh battery. Given that the phone has an HD+ display and a power-efficient chipset, the battery life, as expected, turned out to be extremely impressive. Talking about numbers, in our HD video loop test, Realme C1 lasted around 22 hours (yes, you read it right) before running out of juice. In daily usage, I had to plug the phone back in roughly one and a half days after the initial charge. Suffice to say, Realme C1 will be a great companion for you on long road trips and you can leave your bulky power banks at home without worrying much about the battery life. Truth be told, priced at Rs 6,999, the Realme C1 competes directly with the Xiaomi Redmi 6A (review) in this price category. With a nice design, impressive display, and a commendable battery life, the phone does leave a mark, but certain performance-related issues create a concern for long-term usage. On the other hand, with the Xiaomi Redmi 6A, you get a similar camera quality, smoother performance, but an outdated design and a smaller battery. In the end, it depends on you whether you prefer smoother performance over a large battery or not. From my perspective, the Realme C1 gets a thumbs up for offering good value for money"
2358,30,33254,4,5,2018-11-28,,33254,Ketaki Bhojnagarwala -,Realme U1 review: a shark in the mid-range,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/realme-u1-review?pid=33254," Over the last few months, OPPO’s subsidiary smartphone brand Realme has quickly established itself as a formidable rival to Xiaomi in India. The company’s first phone – the Realme 1 (review), was a notable competitor to the Redmi Note 5 Pro (review), while the affordable C1 (review) took on the likes of the Redmi 6A (review). Realme, which has since distanced itself from OPPO to become a standalone brand, has now launched the U1, a selfie-focussed offering in the mid-range. I’ve been testing Realme U1 for the last week, and here’s what you need to know. The Realme U1 is among the most stylish smartphones you’ll currently find in this price band. You might be fooled into thinking the back panel is glass (I was), but it’s actually made of a transparent acrylic composite, which Realme says is more durable and scratch-resistant. My review unit was black, but you can also get the phone in blue and gold colour options. The back panel features a ‘light pillar’ effect that creates vertical patterns when held up against a light source. This, coupled with the waterdrop notch on the display, makes the Realme U1 quite the stunner. It even makes the recently-launched Redmi Note 6 Pro (review) look clunky in comparison. The Realme U1 features rounded edges, which make it comfortable to hold despite the slab-like form factor. At the rear, you’ll find the dual primary cameras and LED flash in a horizontal setup, with a fingerprint sensor below.The Realme U1 features a 6.3-inch display with full HD+ resolution. The display is sharp with good viewing angles and punchy colours, but visibility falters under sunlight. With an aspect ratio of 19:5:9, and the absence of bezels barring a slim chin at the bottom, the U1’s screen delivers an immersive viewing experience. A layer of Gorilla Glass 3 protects the screen, and Realme has also installed a screen protector out of the box. Another goodie you’ll find in the box is a clear case. The case is of good quality, but has an annoying flap over the micro-USB port that gets in the way when you want to quickly plug in the charger. The Realme U1 is a selfie-focussed smartphone, and to that end, is fitted with a 25MP front camera with f/2.0 aperture. There’s no front-facing LED, but you do get a screen flash for illumination. The front camera can also create a software-generated depth effect. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of photos from the selfie camera, which turned out well even in low light or when there was harsh backlighting. Images are clear with natural skin tones, and while I disabled the AI beauty mode, you can enable it if you prefer. The depth effect doesn’t over-blur the background either, so images look realistic. The rear cameras come in a 13MP+2MP configuration, with the latter being a depth sensor. Unlike the front camera, the rear camera offers a dedicated Portrait mode, with several iPhone-inspired studio lighting options like Natural, Film, Mono, etc. The Portrait mode works well, both for humans as well as objects, and like the front camera, doesn’t artificially blur the background. Daylight shots turned out vibrant and detailed, although I did notice that some images look over-sharpened and over-saturated. Low light shots are grainy, but usable nonetheless. My only qualm with the rear cameras were that they struggle with locking focus for macro shots, particularly if the background is busy. Take a look at some image samples below. Even though Realme has positioned itself as an independent brand, it still borrows its software from OPPO. As a result, the Realme U1 runs ColorOS 5.2 atop Android 8.1 Oreo. If you’ve used an OPPO phone in the past, you’ll be familiar with the interface, which has tons of added features. Many of these are useful and let you fine-tune settings to your liking, but some are redundant. For example, the Smart Assistant that is displayed on the left of the homescreen is basically OPPO’s version of Google Assistant. ColorOS also comes with a ton of bloatware – I counted eight third-party apps. Thankfully, these can be uninstalled. Powering the Realme U1 is an octa-core MediaTek Helio P70 chipset clocked at 2.1GHz. My unit came with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage (48GB out of the box), but there’s also a lower-specced variant with 3GB RAM and 32GB storage. The storage is expandable up to 256GB via a dedicated microSD card slot, which is always a welcome feature. While I didn’t notice any glaring issues with day-to-day performance, navigating the interface, multi-tasking and opening apps seemed sluggish. The heavy nature of ColorOS is more likely to blame for this than the processor though. Gaming is a breeze on the device, with graphics-heavy titles like Asphalt 8 running smoothly with no frame drops. The phone heats up during extended gaming sessions, but doesn’t get uncomfortably hot. The Realme U1 offers both a fingerprint sensor and face unlock for security. The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate, and was my preferred unlock method. The face unlock feature is also fast, but requires you to swipe up on the lockscreen to unlock the phone, which is an extra step. Since the U1 lacks an infrared sensor, face unlock doesn’t work in the dark, so I’d advise setting up the fingerprint sensor alongside as well. The battery on the Realme U1 is one of its best features. The 3,500mAh pack is capable of lasting more than a day with heavy use, even with hotspot enabled for a couple of hours. In our battery drain test, the device performed admirably, clocking 16 hours before running out of juice. Recharging the phone with the included charger took 2.5 hours. The Realme U1 is one of the most well-rounded smartphones you can buy at its asking price. It ticks most boxes for me, and doesn’t have any serious downsides, barring ColorOS, which I’m not a fan of. Predictably, Realme is positioning the U1 as a competitor to Xiaomi’s Redmi Y2 (review). Other notable rivals include the Honor 8C (first impressions), ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 (review) and Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro (review). While you might opt for a different phone based purely on brand preference, if it’s a good selfie camera you’re after, the Realme U1 is your best bet."

Images are clear with natural skin tones, and while I disabled the AI beauty mode, you can enable it if you prefer. The depth effect doesn’t over-blur the background either, so images look realistic. The rear cameras come in a 13MP+2MP configuration, with the latter being a depth sensor. Unlike the front camera, the rear camera offers a dedicated Portrait mode, with several iPhone-inspired studio lighting options like Natural, Film, Mono, etc. The Portrait mode works well, both for humans as well as objects, and like the front camera, doesn’t artificially blur the background. Daylight shots turned out vibrant and detailed, although I did notice that some images look over-sharpened and over-saturated. Low light shots are grainy, but usable nonetheless. My only qualm with the rear cameras were that they struggle with locking focus for macro shots, particularly if the background is busy. Take a look at some image samples below. Even though Realme has positioned itself as an independent brand, it still borrows its software from OPPO. As a result, the Realme U1 runs ColorOS 5.2 atop Android 8.1 Oreo. If you’ve used an OPPO phone in the past, you’ll be familiar with the interface, which has tons of added features. Many of these are useful and let you fine-tune settings to your liking, but some are redundant. For example, the Smart Assistant that is displayed on the left of the homescreen is basically OPPO’s version of Google Assistant. ColorOS also comes with a ton of bloatware – I counted eight third-party apps. Thankfully, these can be uninstalled. Powering the Realme U1 is an octa-core MediaTek Helio P70 chipset clocked at 2.1GHz. My unit came with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage (48GB out of the box), but there’s also a lower-specced variant with 3GB RAM and 32GB storage. The storage is expandable up to 256GB via a dedicated microSD card slot, which is always a welcome feature. While I didn’t notice any glaring issues with day-to-day performance, navigating the interface, multi-tasking and opening apps seemed sluggish. The heavy nature of ColorOS is more likely to blame for this than the processor though. Gaming is a breeze on the device, with graphics-heavy titles like Asphalt 8 running smoothly with no frame drops. The phone heats up during extended gaming sessions, but doesn’t get uncomfortably hot. The Realme U1 offers both a fingerprint sensor and face unlock for security. The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate, and was my preferred unlock method. The face unlock feature is also fast, but requires you to swipe up on the lockscreen to unlock the phone, which is an extra step. Since the U1 lacks an infrared sensor, face unlock doesn’t work in the dark, so I’d advise setting up the fingerprint sensor alongside as well. The battery on the Realme U1 is one of its best features. The 3,500mAh pack is capable of lasting more than a day with heavy use, even with hotspot enabled for a couple of hours. In our battery drain test, the device performed admirably, clocking 16 hours before running out of juice. Recharging the phone with the included charger took 2.5 hours. The Realme U1 is one of the most well-rounded smartphones you can buy at its asking price. It ticks most boxes for me, and doesn’t have any serious downsides, barring ColorOS, which I’m not a fan of. Predictably, Realme is positioning the U1 as a competitor to Xiaomi’s Redmi Y2 (review). Other notable rivals include the Honor 8C (first impressions), ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 (review) and Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro (review). While you might opt for a different phone based purely on brand preference, if it’s a good selfie camera you’re after, the Realme U1 is your best bet."

The company’s first phone – the Realme 1 (review), was a notable competitor to the Redmi Note 5 Pro (review), while the affordable C1 (review) took on the likes of the Redmi 6A (review). Realme, which has since distanced itself from OPPO to become a standalone brand, has now launched the U1, a selfie-focussed offering in the mid-range. I’ve been testing Realme U1 for the last week, and here’s what you need to know. The Realme U1 is among the most stylish smartphones you’ll currently find in this price band. You might be fooled into thinking the back panel is glass (I was), but it’s actually made of a transparent acrylic composite, which Realme says is more durable and scratch-resistant. My review unit was black, but you can also get the phone in blue and gold colour options. The back panel features a ‘light pillar’ effect that creates vertical patterns when held up against a light source. This, coupled with the waterdrop notch on the display, makes the Realme U1 quite the stunner. It even makes the recently-launched Redmi Note 6 Pro (review) look clunky in comparison. The Realme U1 features rounded edges, which make it comfortable to hold despite the slab-like form factor. At the rear, you’ll find the dual primary cameras and LED flash in a horizontal setup, with a fingerprint sensor below.The Realme U1 features a 6.3-inch display with full HD+ resolution. The display is sharp with good viewing angles and punchy colours, but visibility falters under sunlight. With an aspect ratio of 19:5:9, and the absence of bezels barring a slim chin at the bottom, the U1’s screen delivers an immersive viewing experience. A layer of Gorilla Glass 3 protects the screen, and Realme has also installed a screen protector out of the box. Another goodie you’ll find in the box is a clear case. The case is of good quality, but has an annoying flap over the micro-USB port that gets in the way when you want to quickly plug in the charger. The Realme U1 is a selfie-focussed smartphone, and to that end, is fitted with a 25MP front camera with f/2.0 aperture. There’s no front-facing LED, but you do get a screen flash for illumination.

2484,30,33429,3.5,5,2019-03-19,,33429,Shekhar Thakran -,Samsung Galaxy A30 review: the Korean giant gets serious in the mid-range,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-a30-review?pid=33429," “The Galaxy A30 offers a brilliant display and an amazing UI experience that is unmatched in this price range Whenever someone has asked me to recommend a good mid-range phone in recent years, my mind has instantaneously moved in Xiaomi‘s direction. Last year, there were some respectable offerings from ASUS and Realme in this price range but up until recently, Samsung hadn’t launched a head-turning phone in this price bracket.   Thankfully, Samsung has brought its A-game in 2019 with the launch of Galaxy M series phones earlier this year and is now taking that forward with the launch of new smartphones in the Galaxy A series. I recently got hands on the Galaxy A30 (first impressions), which sits between the budget-centric A10 and higher-end A50. And after using the phone as a daily driver for some time, I am ready to share whether this should be your next phone or not. Without wasting another second, let’s jump into the Samsung galaxy A30 review. I usually share the design aspects for most phones before coming to the display but Galaxy A30 is a solid exception to this rule. This is because the 6.4-inch full-HD+ Super AMOLED panel on this new phone from Samsung is gorgeous. We’ve all known for years that Samsung makes some of the best display panels in the industry but for its price, Galaxy A30 offers an incredible display that is crisp, vibrant, and amazing to look at. The Chaebol is yet to bring Infinity-O design to this series and as a result, you are treated to a waterdrop notch design, called Infinity-U, which isn’t a compromise in any way, if you ask me. I used the phone for watching movies, music videos, and browsing Netflix but the screen never let me down in any way. It will not be wrong to say that the panel on Galaxy A30 is hard to distinguish from the displays on some of the premium phones available in the market. The viewing angles are good and the display holds up well in different lighting conditions as well. The Night Mode theme, which I’ll talk about later in detail, looks especially impressive as the darks look particularly good on Super AMOLED panels. The thin bezels on the top and the sides of the panel help in providing an immersive multimedia experience to the user. Considering all this, I can say that the display on the Galaxy A30 is the best that you can get in this price range.In terms of the design, as mentioned in our first impressions, the Galaxy A30 comes with a glossy polycarbonate back that lends it a premium look. Apart from the Samsung branding, there’s a pill-shaped fingerprint sensor in the middle, while the dual-camera setup is located on the top-left accompanied by an LED flash. The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate as one might hope and I never felt like there were any issues in this department. Speaking of ergonomics, despite a large display, the handset fits nicely in the hand and you’ll find the power button and the volume rocker on the right side of the phone. The SIM card slot is located on the left spine. At the bottom, you will find the USB type-C charging port along with the loudspeaker grilles and a 3.5mm audio socket. In sum, the Galaxy A30 looks and feels like a premium phone and although the phone’s rear acts as a magnet for fingerprints, the overall designThe Samsung Galaxy A30 comes with a dual-camera array at the back that features a primary 16MP sensor and a wide-angle 5MP sensor. At the front, you are treated with a 16MP sensor for selfies and video calls. Now, personally, I believe that if a brand has to include multiple camera sensors on a phone, the most useful sensor they can add to the primary one is a wide-angle sensor as it provides a unique perspective to the photos and helps you capture some really good shots even in spaces where it’s not physically possible to move back. Kudos to Samsung for listeningIn the default camera app, you’ll find some familiar options again in the form of Auto mode, Live Focus mode, Panorama, and Video mode on the home screen. In the video mode, you will be able to shoot videos in up to FHD resolution. Sadly, it misses out on 4k video recording, which is available in rivals like the Redmi Note 7 Pro.  Coming to the image quality, the Galaxy A30 managed to take some impressive shots with a good amount of detail. I was satisfied with the dynamic range on offer, although I wouldn’t describe it as class-leading or even standout. To my surprise, the images taken in night conditions did not turn out to be grainy and were actually decent, which is a rarity when it comes to mid-range handsets. However, again, the best aspect of the camera setup is the wide-angle sensor, and while there’s a slight fisheye effect, as you might expect, it isn’t noticeable to a point where it would ruin the pictures. Take a look at the difference that the wide-angle sensor brings with the slider embedded below      Samsung is still sticking with Experience UI for the Galaxy M series phones but thankfully, the brand has opted for Android Pie-based One UI for the Galaxy A series models. For those who are unaware, Samsung has already switched to One UI with its flagship models and even the phones that were launched before the new UI officially rolled out have received it via an OTA update. One of the first things that you will notice about One UI is that the platform feels incredibly minimalistic and uncluttered as compared to Experience UI. The UI animations feel smooth and the bubble-like theme for menus and notifications is aesthetically pleasing. You can get access to the notification shade by simply swiping down on the home screen and swiping down twice will present more options right there, which is a convenient option on a phone with a 6.4-inch display that makes it hard to reach the top corners while using the phone with one hand. Swiping up will take you to the app drawer just like it does on the stock iteration of Android.  Although the default light theme itself is pretty good in itself, the Night Mode was my preferred theme out of the two. The icon size, as well as the font size for the One UI by default, is slightly larger than stock Android but you can customise these two as per your preferences. There is the Digital Wellbeing section as well, which helps you keep track of your phone usage and improve it to make lifestyle better. The Lock Screen Stories feature, which presents you with info on the lockscreen as per your preferences, also makes a return but can thankfully be disabled easily too. Like most recent phones, you also get the face unlock feature, which works just fine.  Under the hood, the Samsung Galaxy A30 comes powered by the octa-core Exynos 7904 chipset, which is coupled with 3GB or 4GB of RAM. The hardware works well and doesn’t present glaring performance issues. However, after some time, I did notice some occasional hiccups when switching between the apps and even while simply changing the display orientation. While playing PUBG, the phone ran the survival game at medium graphics settings well but struggled at high graphics settings. For storage, the smartphone ships with 32GB or 64GB memory onboard, depending upon the variant you opt for.  It’s a tad unfortunate that the brand has opted for a slightly less capable chipset as otherwise, the phone offers good performance. Again, for the sake of clarification, I would like to point out that the Galaxy A30 feels smooth on most occasions.  Packing in a 4,000mAh battery, the Galaxy A30 comes with enough fuel to last through the day. Being a heavy user myself, I didn’t need to look for the adapter before the end of the day or even till the next morning, in many cases. This reflected in our HD video loop test too, as the phone lasted for around 17.5 hours, which is a pretty good result. The device also comes bundled with a 15W fast charger, which is a plus.   Coming to the loudspeaker performance, the phone delivers a decent output and the maximum volume level and the audio quality are both very good. I personally enjoy watching multimedia content with earphones plugged in but it is good to know that if I somehow leave my earphones at home by mistake, the phone does not disappoint with its loudspeaker performance. Truth be told, the Samsung Galaxy A30 delivers quite a lot at an affordable price of Rs 16,999. The handset’s display is its strongest point and the inclusion of One UI makes the deal even better. The only qualm I have with the phone concerns the performance department and if that was not the case, I would not think twice before recommending it to anyone.   However, in the current scenario, the phone will have to take on the likes of the Redmi Note 7 Pro, ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M2 (review), and Samsung’s very own Galaxy M30. Since the Galaxy M30 comes with a triple-camera setup and a bigger battery (5,000mAh vs 4,000mAh) while being cheaper by Rs 2,000, it will eventually boil down to the choice of platforms between Experience UI and One UI that will sway the decision to one side. However, bear in mind that the Galaxy M30 (first impressions) will be receiving One UI later this year with an OTA update. When it comes to Redmi Note 7 Pro, you get a much better processor in comparison to the Galaxy A30, a 48MP rear camera and a debatably better design. Not to mention that Xiaomi has priced the handset atttractively at Rs 13,999 — a good Rs 3k lesser than the A30.  In a nutshell, Samsung’s Galaxy A30 is a complete package in the mid-range, but you’d need to weigh your options carefully before zeroing in on it.

2439,30,33299,3.5,5,2019-03-16,,33299,Prateek Pandey -,Samsung Galaxy A50 review: taking the fight back to Chinese rivals,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-a50-review?pid=33299," “Our two cents on Samsung’s most powerful handset in the A series — the Galaxy A50 As per a recent report from IDC (International Data Corporation), Korean tech giant Samsung has lost a good chunk of its market share to numerous Chinese OEMs in India. Be it Xiaomi, which displaced the brand from its top spot, or phonemakers like Realme and Honor, the company is facing competition left, right and centre. But Samsung isn’t one to take things lying down, and the Chaebol’s latest smartphones are well-equipped to take the fight straight to the Chinese influx.  The company started its battle with the Galaxy M series, and now it’s expanding that with the launch of a trio of smartphones in the Galaxy A series. The devices in the A series are priced quite competitively, and yet come packed with powerful features. One such handset is the Galaxy A50 (first impressions), which I’ve been testing for the better part of a week. If you were thinking about picking the device up, then read on to know about its strengths and weaknesses. Samsung has a penchant for designing good-looking smartphones, but it refrained from bringing that to the affordable segment. The Galaxy A50 turns that notion on its head. The device comes clad in a polycarbonate shell, but I’m willing to bet that the smartphone’s glossy finish will fool you into thinking that it’s made of glass. The device looks straight out of a chic boutique store and it comes in numerous peppy hues. However, buyers residing in India will be limited to Black, Blue and White colourways of the device. That’s a bit of a bummer, as the bright orange variant of the smartphone I checked out at MWC Barcelona looked other-worldly.  That said, the all-black paint job on my review unit looks dazzling too, especially when rays of light strike its back to show off an iridescent glow. Samsung has even paid heed to the little things, such as keeping the camera bump to the minimum, thereby ensuring you can use the device even when it’s put flat on a table. What’s more, the physical buttons are adequately tactile, and there’s even an in-display fingerprint sensor on the device — making it one of the most affordable smartphones to boast an invisible fingerprint reader. Now, granted, it’s not the quickest in the market, but the scanner has been positioned within thumb’s reach under the display and was reliable enough during my testing too.You’ll also get a 3.5mm headphone socket with the device, which is always a welcome sight along with a USB Type-C port for charging, bringing up Samsung’s affordable handset up to the speed with the competition.  The Samsung Galaxy A50 offers a remarkable in-hand grip too. The device nestles comfortably in the palms owing to its tapered back which blends seamlessly into the edges. The corners have been rounded off as well, which coupled with the smartphone’s sleek girth ensure that you won’t feel the device pressing against your thighs when it’s inside the pocket of your jeans. And, thanks in no small part to its sleek bezels, the 6.4-inch display on the Galaxy A50 can be operated with just one hand quite comfortably. The design of the smartphone is not without its flaws though. The back panel of the device is a fingerprint magnet and the smartphone doesn’t feel as premium in the hand like a proper glass-back phone either. But, on the whole, the smartphone’s design is up there with the most stylish offerings in this segment.  As I mentioned previously, the Galaxy A50 ships with a 6.4-inch AMOLED display, which bears an FHD+ resolution. Unsurprisingly, consuming content on the device is a visual treat, especially since the panel features a tiny Infinity-U notch which isn’t as intrusive as a traditional camera cut-out. What’s more, Samsung has added a bunch of cool animations to highlight the smartphone’s U-shaped notch too and there’s a transition effect when you unlock the phone using facial recognition or switch to the selfie camera in the camera app. The panel has excellent viewing angles too and it gets reasonably bright as well. All in all, the display on the Galaxy A50 is among the best in its class and I expected no less from Samsung The Samsung Galaxy A50 is backed by the company’s in-house Exynos 9610 octa-core processor which in the case of my review unit, worked alongside 4GB of RAM and 64GB of user-expandable storage. However, buyers looking for a bit more grunt can opt for a 6GB RAM variant of the device too  Now, the Exynos 9610 utilises ARM’s older Cortex-A73 performance cores which work in conjunction with battery-efficient Cortex A53 cores. Consequently, you should expect better performance from a smartphone which is backed by newer Cortex-A75 or A76 performance cores, such as the recently launched Redmi Note 7 Pro. With that out of the way, I can confirm that the performance of the A50 isn’t all that bad either.  Apps opened swiftly on the device and for the most part, multitasking was buttery smooth too. The smartphone did struggle to render animations cleanly when I was juggling between resource hungry applications like Twitter and Chrome, but that can be boiled down to the 4GB RAM model I was using. In the gaming department, the handset breezed through casual titles like Clash Royale and Alto’s Adventure, however, I had to tone down the graphics setting in demanding games like PUBG. Even then, there were some significant frame drops during intense battles, which made me lose a lot more than I otherwise would. Therefore, if you’re a hard-core gamer, then the similarly priced POCO F1 (review) is where your money should be at.  As for the battery life, the Samsung Galaxy A50 ships with a 4,000mAh cell which managed to last me a full day on heavy usage. To give you a better picture, my usage involved juggling between various social media apps like Fenix, WhatsApp and Instagram, playing a Classic game of PUBG Mobile and listening to songs on Apple Music. By the time I hit the bed, the device had clocked in over four hours of screen on time, which is quite an impressive number.     Samsung has really upped the ante in the software department and the Galaxy A50 boots the company’s One UI on top of Android Pie. I’ve always disliked the company’s custom skin, but the brand’s all-new One UI comes across as a breath of fresh air. The skin is quite minimalistic and comes bundled with practical features like an all-dark mode, a device manager and navigational gestures. What’s more, the company has deployed some clever animations to better the UI experience. For instance, swiping down on the home-screen brings down the notification tray, but the kicker is that when you swipe down on the display again, the icons at the top are lowered further, making them more accessible to someone with tiny hands. Everything considered, it was about time Samsung improved its software and with One UI, the company has genuinely outdone itself. Samsung is no stranger to furnishing its devices with multiple cameras and the Galaxy A50 too features a triple-camera array towards the back comprising a 25MP f/1.7 standard shooter, an 8MP wide-angle lens with a 123-degree of field of view and a 5MP depth sensor. For selfies, the smartphone comes with a 25MP f/2.0 sensor.  Clearly, Samsung is going all out in the photography department and it shows. The handset managed to click some incredible shots and barring a handful of issues, I don’t have any complaints with the A50’s cameras. I’ll sum up my experience with the smartphone in the form of bullet points, so here we go: 1) The Samsung Galaxy A50’s primary 25MP shooter clicks phenomenal photos. The pics I shot with the phone in broad daylight had ample amounts of details, exhibited punchy colours and showcased quite possibly the best dynamic range I’ve seen on any affordable Samsung smartphone. 2) The handset comes with a scene optimiser, toggling which, the pictures look much more dramatic. I loved using this mode to click cloudy skies and sunsets, as the colours appeared more vivid and the different shades of grey in the clouds were highlighted more prominently. However, I’ll advise you against clicking macros of red / orange flowers with the feature turned on as the smartphone botches up the details in the petals quite a bit. 3) The HDR mode works really well on the device. Pictures clicked with the HDR turned on had noticeably more details in the shadows, and on the whole, the scene just felt more appealing to the eyes.  4) The wide-angle shooter gets exceptionally wide, which although helps you paint on a much, much bigger canvas, also creates a distinctive fisheye effect. Regardless, unlike most other devices which leverage a wider lens, the Galaxy A50’s module doesn’t skimp on the details. It should be noted that the scene optimizer works on the wide-angle lens as well. 5) Despite shipping with a 5MP depth sensor, the Samsung Galaxy A50 didn’t create a convincing blur effect in portrait shots. Often, the blur effect crept into the parts I wanted in focus, which wasn’t what I was expecting.  6) The 25MP front camera on the Galaxy A50 is downright excellent and there was nary an instance when I didn’t enjoy a selfie I’d taken with the smartphone. The pictures had a ton of details and unlike most smartphones from Chinese OEMs, the beauty mode on the A50 can actually be turned ‘off’. What’s more, the smartphone didn’t overexpose the background when the source of light was behind me and instead, retained the information by cleverly tweaking and exposing the frame. Suffice it to say, if you’ve got a penchant for photography, then Samsung’s Galaxy A50 won’t disappoint you. In my books, the Galaxy A50 is Samsung’s best attempt yet to fend off the Chinese competition. The smartphone offers a gorgeous design, a stunning display, long-lasting battery life, excellent cameras, and good performance, all while being priced quite competitively. The handset starts at Rs 19,990, which honestly, is a really good price from Samsung. In fact, after a long time, I don’t feel that buyers have to pay a premium to get a capable smartphone from the company.   Unfortunately, the pricing is still not competitive enough to sway gamers away from the Snapdragon 845-toting Poco F1. Moreover, the recently launched Redmi Note 7 Pro could give the A50 a run for its money too as it features a slightly more powerful CPU, comes with Sony’s 48MP imaging sensor and costs much less.  However, for all the Samsung loyalists, the Galaxy A50 is a stellar buy, and if this is a sign of things to come, I can’t wait for the more offerings from the South Korean giant in the affordable and mid-budget segments."
2439,30,33299,3.5,5,2019-03-16,,33299,Prateek Pandey -,Samsung Galaxy A50 review: taking the fight back to Chinese rivals,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-a50-review?pid=33299," “Our two cents on Samsung’s most powerful handset in the A series — the Galaxy A50 As per a recent report from IDC (International Data Corporation), Korean tech giant Samsung has lost a good chunk of its market share to numerous Chinese OEMs in India. Be it Xiaomi, which displaced the brand from its top spot, or phonemakers like Realme and Honor, the company is facing competition left, right and centre. But Samsung isn’t one to take things lying down, and the Chaebol’s latest smartphones are well-equipped to take the fight straight to the Chinese influx.  The company started its battle with the Galaxy M series, and now it’s expanding that with the launch of a trio of smartphones in the Galaxy A series. The devices in the A series are priced quite competitively, and yet come packed with powerful features. One such handset is the Galaxy A50 (first impressions), which I’ve been testing for the better part of a week. If you were thinking about picking the device up, then read on to know about its strengths and weaknesses. Samsung has a penchant for designing good-looking smartphones, but it refrained from bringing that to the affordable segment. The Galaxy A50 turns that notion on its head. The device comes clad in a polycarbonate shell, but I’m willing to bet that the smartphone’s glossy finish will fool you into thinking that it’s made of glass. The device looks straight out of a chic boutique store and it comes in numerous peppy hues. However, buyers residing in India will be limited to Black, Blue and White colourways of the device. That’s a bit of a bummer, as the bright orange variant of the smartphone I checked out at MWC Barcelona looked other-worldly.  That said, the all-black paint job on my review unit looks dazzling too, especially when rays of light strike its back to show off an iridescent glow. Samsung has even paid heed to the little things, such as keeping the camera bump to the minimum, thereby ensuring you can use the device even when it’s put flat on a table. What’s more, the physical buttons are adequately tactile, and there’s even an in-display fingerprint sensor on the device — making it one of the most affordable smartphones to boast an invisible fingerprint reader. Now, granted, it’s not the quickest in the market, but the scanner has been positioned within thumb’s reach under the display and was reliable enough during my testing too.You’ll also get a 3.5mm headphone socket with the device, which is always a welcome sight along with a USB Type-C port for charging, bringing up Samsung’s affordable handset up to the speed with the competition.  The Samsung Galaxy A50 offers a remarkable in-hand grip too. The device nestles comfortably in the palms owing to its tapered back which blends seamlessly into the edges. The corners have been rounded off as well, which coupled with the smartphone’s sleek girth ensure that you won’t feel the device pressing against your thighs when it’s inside the pocket of your jeans. And, thanks in no small part to its sleek bezels, the 6.4-inch display on the Galaxy A50 can be operated with just one hand quite comfortably. The design of the smartphone is not without its flaws though. The back panel of the device is a fingerprint magnet and the smartphone doesn’t feel as premium in the hand like a proper glass-back phone either. But, on the whole, the smartphone’s design is up there with the most stylish offerings in this segment.  As I mentioned previously, the Galaxy A50 ships with a 6.4-inch AMOLED display, which bears an FHD+ resolution. Unsurprisingly, consuming content on the device is a visual treat, especially since the panel features a tiny Infinity-U notch which isn’t as intrusive as a traditional camera cut-out. What’s more, Samsung has added a bunch of cool animations to highlight the smartphone’s U-shaped notch too and there’s a transition effect when you unlock the phone using facial recognition or switch to the selfie camera in the camera app. The panel has excellent viewing angles too and it gets reasonably bright as well. All in all, the display on the Galaxy A50 is among the best in its class and I expected no less from Samsung The Samsung Galaxy A50 is backed by the company’s in-house Exynos 9610 octa-core processor which in the case of my review unit, worked alongside 4GB of RAM and 64GB of user-expandable storage. However, buyers looking for a bit more grunt can opt for a 6GB RAM variant of the device too  Now, the Exynos 9610 utilises ARM’s older Cortex-A73 performance cores which work in conjunction with battery-efficient Cortex A53 cores. Consequently, you should expect better performance from a smartphone which is backed by newer Cortex-A75 or A76 performance cores, such as the recently launched Redmi Note 7 Pro. With that out of the way, I can confirm that the performance of the A50 isn’t all that bad either.  Apps opened swiftly on the device and for the most part, multitasking was buttery smooth too. The smartphone did struggle to render animations cleanly when I was juggling between resource hungry applications like Twitter and Chrome, but that can be boiled down to the 4GB RAM model I was using. In the gaming department, the handset breezed through casual titles like Clash Royale and Alto’s Adventure, however, I had to tone down the graphics setting in demanding games like PUBG. Even then, there were some significant frame drops during intense battles, which made me lose a lot more than I otherwise would. Therefore, if you’re a hard-core gamer, then the similarly priced POCO F1 (review) is where your money should be at.  As for the battery life, the Samsung Galaxy A50 ships with a 4,000mAh cell which managed to last me a full day on heavy usage. To give you a better picture, my usage involved juggling between various social media apps like Fenix, WhatsApp and Instagram, playing a Classic game of PUBG Mobile and listening to songs on Apple Music. By the time I hit the bed, the device had clocked in over four hours of screen on time, which is quite an impressive number.     Samsung has really upped the ante in the software department and the Galaxy A50 boots the company’s One UI on top of Android Pie. I’ve always disliked the company’s custom skin, but the brand’s all-new One UI comes across as a breath of fresh air. The skin is quite minimalistic and comes bundled with practical features like an all-dark mode, a device manager and navigational gestures. What’s more, the company has deployed some clever animations to better the UI experience. For instance, swiping down on the home-screen brings down the notification tray, but the kicker is that when you swipe down on the display again, the icons at the top are lowered further, making them more accessible to someone with tiny hands.

2449,30,33447,3.5,5,2019-01-28,,33447,Shekhar Thakran -,Samsung Galaxy M10 review: makes an emphatic claim for mindshare in the affordable segment,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-m10-review?pid=33447," “The Galaxy M10 feels incredibly light in the hand as the phone’s body is primarily made out of plasticIt has been some time since Samsung last introduced a new smartphone series, but to start off 2019 with a defining statement, the South Korean brand has now unveiled not one, but two handsets from its brand new ‘Galaxy M‘ range. In this review, we’ll be going over the more affordable variant out of the two –  the Galaxy M10, and let you know whether the company is ready to take on the likes of Xiaomi and Realme in this price range or not.  Just two years ago, we would have been extremely liberal with our evaluation of a smartphone’s design in the budget price bracket. However, handsets launched in the affordable price range last year raised the bar for this category. Coming to the Galaxy M10, one of the key design highlights is the fact that it utilises an Infiniti V display, which is Samsung’s term for a waterdrop notch. The brand seems to have skipped the notch display bandwagon entirely, and directly jumped onto this latest fad. The phone’s body is primarily made out of plastic, which looks good but does attract a few scuffs after regular use. We liked the build quality of the phone and can vouch for the fact that it does not look cheap.The most notable difference as compared to the M20 is that the back of the Galaxy M10 does not feature a fingerprint sensor. Now, admittedly, the lack of a fingerprint sensor might prove to be a dealbreaker for some users but to compensate for this, the brand is offering a face unlock feature. We will discuss the performance of this security feature in detail later on.  Going with a look reminiscent of ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2 (review), the Galaxy M10 sports a dual camera module at the back that is located on the top left in a vertical orientation, with an LED light right below to assist in low-light conditions. The phone’s frame is fairly thin and houses the volume rocker and the power button on the right side.At the bottom of the phone, you will find the audio jack and the micro-USB charging port. The SIM card slot is located on the left. The Galaxy M10 comes with a triple slot tray that has a dedicated slot for the microSD card.   Without wasting any more time, let’s discuss the display on Galaxy M10. The Galaxy M10, just like its sibling, comes with an Infinity-V notch design that is not much different than the waterdrop notch found on several other Android handsets. The bottom bezel, however, is reasonably thick. In between the top and the bottom bezel, you will find a 6.22-inch HD+ display that looks vibrant from the word go. Regarding the notch design, we have come to a point where most phones feature some kind of notch. If you have an issue with this design choice, you can choose the ‘Hide camera‘ option from Full Screen Apps section in the settings. If we talk about the display quality specifically, despite being low on resolution, the panel didn’t disappoint us at all. The text appeared crisp and colours popped out in most use cases. Even the maximum screen brightness was decent enough for outdoor use. The slim bezels provided for an all-around immersive viewing experience. Here’s a closer look at the phone. The Samsung Galaxy M10 comes with a dual camera setup at the back, consisting of a primary 13MP snapper with f/1.9 aperture and a wide-angle 5MP sensor with f/2.2 aperture. At the front, the phone packs an 8MP unit for clicking selfies and video-calling. Before we dive into the camera performance, we’d like to give you a brief overview of the default camera app. Here, you get the option to click pictures in either regular mode or the wide-angle mode Samsung has also included the Live Focus mode, which essentially lets you click pictures with bokeh effect. It should be kept in mind that this mode only works for human subjects, when the phone is able to recognise a face in the frame. The Galaxy M10 struggles to detect the outlines well but gets the work done on most occasions. You can also choose to click pictures in Panorama, with stickers, or in beauty mode. If you like to adjust the ISO level and white balance before clicking pictures, there is a Pro mode that will let you do just that.The Samsung Mall app is also integrated into the camera app and users can either click pictures of the product they want to search and purchase, or choose an image from the gallery to start shopping. After using this feature for some time, we can say that slightly distinctive products definitely produce good search results but in many cases, the app is not able to recognise the brands and the specific products reliably. Moving to the camera performance, we tried out the Galaxy M10’s snappers in different kinds of settings to understand the sensors better. Now, the dual camera setup on the phone manages to capture details very well and helped us take some good shots. Unfortunately, the dynamic range offered by the camera module is not all that great. There is a notable difference between the images taken with HDR switched on and off, as you can see from the floor in the restaurant image in the camera samples gallery embedded below. However, there was a visible fisheye effect in the images taken with the wide-angle mode. We would have appreciated if the phone would have handled the wide-angle images somewhat like the Galaxy A7 (2018) (review), which showed a very subtle fisheye effect, but sadly, that was not the case.       If we talk about the images taken in low-light conditions, the pictures turned out to be grainy. But on the positive side, the images taken by Galaxy M10 in low-light conditions were better than most of the other handsets in this price range. The phone lets you shoot videos in up to 1080p resolution and the quality of these videos is not bad either.The selfie camera on the Galaxy M10 manages to take some detailed pictures but we did not find it to be quite as impressive as the one found on the Realme 2 (review) and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 (review).  The Galaxy M10 is powered by the brand’s octa-core Exynos 7870 chipset, clocked at 1.6GHz. There are two configurations available for the handset, i.e. 2GB RAM with 16GB storage, and 3GB RAM with 32GB storage, our review unit being the latter. The onboard storage is expandable up to 512GB via a microSD card. Now that we have got the specifications aside, let’s talk about the real-world performance. In the time that we spent with the Galaxy M10, we did not face any stutter or lag issues while switching between the apps or navigating through the user interface. For a budget phone from Samsung, this is an impressive feat. As we do with most phones, irrespective of the price range, we played PUBG Mobile on the phone to figure out how it deals with the graphically demanding game. By default, the game suggested low graphics settings for the phone, which was hardly a surprise. To be fair, we had realistic expectations from the phone before jumping into the game as this handset does not primarily cater to the gaming audience. We faced some stutter issues within the game but we can still say that it was largely playable. To put it simply, if you just want to play a casual game of PUBG Mobile, you won’t be disheartened with the performance offered by the Galaxy M10, but you should look for other options in case you like gaming on your phone.App loading times, in general, are not particularly impressive but in this price range, this will be considered nitpicking. We should mention, however, that we were especially disappointed with the loudspeaker performance offered by the handset.    Having discussed the hardware, it is time to throw some light on the software that drives the Galaxy M10. If you were expecting the phone to load Samsung’s One UI, we should inform you right away that it is not the case. The Galaxy M10 runs Android 8.1 Oreo-based Experience 9.5 user interface out of the box. Samsung has undoubtedly come a long way in the last few years in decluttering its platform and its Experience UI is closer to the stock Android interface than ever before. This means that you can access the app drawer by simply swiping either downwards or upwards from the home screen, use multi-window feature by tapping the option from the recent apps and hold an icon to get access to quick actions. Samsung still has some new and old features up its sleeves to make sure that the interface has something additional to offer over the stock UI. For example, the ‘Lock Screen Stories‘ feature allows users to discover new stories every single time they pick up their phone. We found that as we had the face unlock option enabled, this feature was a little blink and miss for us… but a dynamic lock screen is an interesting idea nevertheless. Additionally, users can also choose the categories for these stories in case they want to see stories of a particular genre.  
 Then there are some pre-installed apps from Microsoft, Google, and of course Samsung. The Game Launcher feature, as you might already know, serves to improve your gaming performance by hiding notification banners and allocating phone’s resources to gaming, in case you choose to do so. Coming to the face unlock feature that we mentioned briefly in the design section, the unlocking method worked just fine for us. However, it takes slightly more than a second to unlock, which is not bad but slower than some other phones in the market. There is also a nice animation effect around the notch area as soon as you unlock the phone. 
 Overall, there are just a handful of pre-installed apps and all of them can either be disabled or uninstalled. The clean interface definitely looks promising and should work well in the long run. Compared to the Galaxy M20, which houses a massive 5,000mAh battery, the Galaxy M10 uses a smaller, 3,400mAh cell. So how does this translate into real-world usage?  To put things into perspective, the M10 managed to last for around a day in regular use, which is not bad. In our HD video loop test, the Galaxy M10 lasted for around 17 hours, which should be enough for most users. Samsung has not launched a lot of affordable phones in the recent past, and Galaxy M10 looks like a solid entry in the market below the Rs 10,000 mark. The phone offers a good display, decent camera performance, and a satisfactory battery backup, which are some of the most appealing features for any potential customer. However, the Galaxy M10 will be going up against the likes of Realme 2 (review) and the Xiaomi Redmi 6 (review), both of which are also compelling offerings in this price range. Despite some minor issues, we can say that the Galaxy M10 gets a thumbs up from our side, and is worth a look for brand-conscious buyers. Photos by Raj Rout"
2450,30,33263,,,2019-01-28,,33263,Nitansh Rastogi -,Samsung Galaxy M20 review: M marks the spot,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-m20-review?pid=33263," BlackBerry. Motorola. Nokia If you are a gadget enthusiast you’d know what’s common between these phone brands. During their heydays, each of them were at the top of the smartphone shipments charts, but now they don’t even rank among the top five phone brands, and have in fact sold their businesses (Motorola was acquired by Google, and later, by Lenovo) or licensed their brand names (BlackBerry to Optiemus Infracom, and Nokia to HMD Global) to others. You must be wondering why I’m talking about these brands in this review. Well, that’s because if you have been following the Indian phone market closely, then you must be aware that Samsung had to let its market share slip from its fingers, with the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei (and its sub-brand Honor), and even OPPO and Vivo increasing in popularity. While the Chaebol still sits on the second spot in terms of the number of shipments, in 2019, Samsung is now trying to claw back, before the competition gets the better of it.  While we’ve been hearing about Samsung planning to hit the reset button for quite some time, the debut offering(s) under its new strategy comes in the form of the Samsung Galaxy M10 and Galaxy M20. Replacing its erstwhile budget and mid-tier Galaxy J and On series, the ‘M’ range is squarely aimed at millennials. So has the manufacturer been able to pull it off successfully? While I’ll let the sales numbers be a better judge of that, I’m here to find out what exactly do you get for your Rs 12,990 if you purchase the higher-end smartphone in the new M series, the Samsung Galaxy M20. Well, all those leaks and teasers were unmissable. And I’m glad they proved to be true, as the Galaxy M20 is quite unlike any of the earlier affordable phones from Samsung phones. It was just in November that the brand showcased new screens that conform to the full-screen future, including the Infinity V display, and the same can be found on the latest offering. While Samsung is usually among the first to jump on a new trend, it seems it skipped the notch fad and chose instead to go with the waterdrop-style cut-out phenomenon. What’s even more intriguing is the fact that you can now find this small (read: minimally obtrusive) notch on the phonemaker’s handsets priced lowed than Rs 15k. At the back, the M20 features a polycarbonate back with a glossy finish, lending it a classy appeal. Long story short, the Galaxy M20 does catch your attention with its small notch and offers a good design, but doesn’t feel as premium as phones with glass backs. On that note, the polycarbonate panel on the handset gathers fingerprints and smudges rather easily, and I’d have loved it if the Korean titan had bundled a silicon case. While my review unit comes in Coral Blue (which looks quite distinct, though I admit I’m biased towards blue), you can also purchase the device in black if you prefer a more sedate look.  Towards the right, you’ll find the power button and volume keys, whereas the left spine is home to an ejectable tray. What’s really interesting is the fact that this tray has dedicated slots for two nano-SIMs and a microSD card. At the bottom, you’ll find the Type-C port sandwiched between a 3.5mm audio socket and a speaker grille. On the rear, you’ll find the dual-camera setup accompanied by an LED flash and an oblong-shaped fingerprint reader.V display though? Well, with a panel measuring 6.3-inches and a full HD+ resolution, the visuals are crisp. And even though the Galaxy M20 features a TFT panel, the colour reproduction is pretty good, and so are the brightness levels. Harsh sunlight doesn’t pose any issues as far as screen legibility is concerned. The screen is protected by a layer of Asahi’s Dragontrail glass to keep scratches and minor nicks at bay. Sadly however, the content doesn’t seem to be optimised for the handset’s aspect ratio, as YouTube and Netflix videos only go up till the notch, which kind of defeats the purpose of having the tiny cut-out (even though you could tweak this from the settings menu, the problem is that the content will be stretched by default and you won’t get an option to get the video till the notch itself). Another problem that I came across is the poor palm rejection ability of the handset. While scrolling through webpages, the content would automatically zoom in and the same issue was also noticeable while using the camera app.One of the biggest complaints against Samsung’s affordable phones has been that they lack necessary sensors like ambient light sensor and proximity sensor. Thankfully, that’s not the case with the M20. Not just that, it also comes with face unlock capability, which works quite well though it’s not the fastest I’ve come across. Sadly, it doesn’t work in dim lighting, and doesn’t seem to be very secure either as the phone unlocks even when your eyes are closed or the face is partially covered. What you will like however, is the animation around the waterdrop notch when the smartphone is attempting to recognise your face. Of course, you can always resort to using the good ol’ fingerprint scanner, which works like a charm.  In the imaging department, the Samsung Galaxy M20 ships with a pair of shooters on the rear. The combination is made up of a 13-megapixel f/1.9 shooter, and instead of a secondary depth-sensing unit, the device gets a wide-angle sensor with a resolution of 5MP and an aperture of f/2.2. For selfies, the smartphone comes with an 8MP snapper.  One look at the camera interface, and you would find yourself right at home if you’ve used a Samsung handset before – which isn’t a bad thing. All the options are nicely laid out on the front itself. In the portrait orientation, you’ll find the shutter button bang in the middle at the bottom, sandwiched between the video-recording button and the preview gallery. Above that, you’ll find the settings menu, full-screen view (for changing the aspect ratio), flash toggle, real-time filters, and the toggle for the front camera. Up top, you’ll get the ability to switch to portrait mode (dubbed Live Focus), Beauty, Pro, Panorama, and use stickers among others. One grouse however, remains the fact that the HDR mode is only accessible by going into the settings, though my advice would be to keep it on Auto instead of fiddling with it every time Quality-wise, you’ll like pictures clicked by Samsung’s Galaxy M20. The colours are pleasing to the eyes (though they aren’t oversaturated, which is slightly odd as the Korean behemoth is known for that) and details are spot on as well, be it in the landscapes or close-up shots. The HDR mode is quite effective too, and offers better contrast in comparison to regular shots. Sadly, low-light pics are riddled with exposure issues and there is a noticeable amount of grain when zoomed in. Shutter speeds and focusing are quick, but autofocusing doesn’t work in the wide-angle mode. Speaking of which, I have been a big proponent of phones that utilise a wide-angle secondary shooter… for the simple reason that they offer a lot of versatility. With the M20 as well, you can get a wider frame without changing your position, though due to the 5-megapixel resolution, you’ll need to compromise on sharpness levels. There’s also the infamous fish-eye effect (the corners / edges look warped), which is more discernible if you are shooting on close quarters. However, I won’t recommend clicking wide-angle pictures in poorly-lit conditions as the results are barely usable. Take a dekko at the normal and wide-angle shots.                 Of course, you don’t need to use wide-angle mode all the time. So here’s a look at the camera samples shot using the primary shooter and selfie snapper of the Galaxy M20. Gone are the days when affordable smartphones offered low-res shooters on the front for selfies and video calling. These days, you can even find 25-megapixel cameras on the fascia of phones! While the selfie shooter on the M20 doesn’t flaunt such a high resolution, its 8MP snapper should serve your purposes well. Selfies captured by the smartphone offer good details along with accurate colour reproduction. There’s also a software-enabled Live Focus mode, which works fairly well. Overall, the cameras should work well across conditions, though they aren’t the best in class by any stretch. With regards to videos, the Samsung Galaxy M20 maxes out at 1080p at 30fps. Even though the device lacks optical stabilisation, the footage is pretty good. That said, I’d have certainly liked to see 4k video recording capability, especially considering that the processor powering the smartphone is capable of that, which brings us to… The Galaxy M20 is the brand’s first handset to come powered by Samsung’s Exynos 7904 chipset. The new 14nm SoC has been built from the ground up for emerging markets, and comprises two ‘big’ Cortex-A73 cores running at 1.8GHz, and six ‘LITTLE’ Cortex-A53 cores tuned at 1.6GHz. Considering it’s a new chip, I decided to put it through a series of benchmarks to see where it stacks up in the pecking order in the sub-Rs 15k category. The segment is without a doubt, quite competitive as along with the dedicated silicon companies like MediaTek and Qualcomm, there are Huawei’s Kirin processors as well. Considering benchmarks is just one part of the equation and aren’t necessarily a reflection of the real-life usage, how is it like to use the Samsung Galaxy M20 as a daily driver? In sum, it’s a smooth experience. In my week-long stint with the handset, there was nary an instance of lag on the phone. Multitasking is flawless too, thanks to the 4-gigs of RAM (there’s a 3GB RAM variant as well). Upon boot, there’s around 1.6GB RAM available, and even with multiple apps open, the phone is able to hold its own. with that, you also get the usual gestures such as those that let you access the app menu with a simple swipe up or down gestures. One thing that will definitely catch your attention on the Galaxy M20 is its lock-screen wallpapers, which keep changing each time you press the power button. Not just that, these aren’t just random images, and are based on what’s going on in the news at that time. You can in fact, click on the info button to read more and if it seems distracting, then you can hit the settings menu to configure the lock screen stories settings. Not only can you disable this feature, you can also choose from 19 categories to only show stories (and relevant wallpapers) from specific topics of interest. My only gripe is the fact the company has opted for Android Oreo as the base, and the promised roll out (August) for 9.0 Pie is quite far away.  As mentioned above, the M20 is a dual-SIM smartphone. Other connectivity options onboard include Wi-Fi (sadly, there’s no ac support), Bluetooth with LDAC support, and GPS. A good speaker is paramount to enjoying multimedia on the go, especially considering the large screen that’s available at your disposal with the Samsung Galaxy M20. And while the one on the device won’t blow you away, it does a good job of offering loud and clear output. Perhaps the biggest USP of the Galaxy M20 is its battery prowess, even more than its Infinity V panel. That’s because Samsung has packed in a capacious 5,000mAh cell inside its latest offering, which ensures that the handset can stay away from the charger for long. To put it simply, you could choose to go to a two-day trip and safely leave the power adapter at home. Charged fully at 7am in the morning, the phone was able to continue till the morning the day after, which is nothing short of impressive, especially considering the fact that I’m a power user and was on 4G / Wi-Fi the entire time, used GPS for navigation, streamed music / videos via Bluetooth and even played a few games during that time. I got an average screen-on time of more than five hours, which is yet another solid indication of the phone’s battery prowess.   It’s also appreciable that the M20 comes with fast charge capabilities and can be juiced up with a 15W adapter. With the bundled charger, the handset goes from 10 to 100 in about two hours, which is quite good considering the battery rating. While reviewing the Galaxy M20, two thoughts were going through my mind: a) Samsung is aiming to offer an all-round package with this phone, and it seems to have done that successfully b) The device isn’t just a sign of Samsung taking its competition seriously, but also the fact that it’s listening to its consumers. From the waterdrop screen to the USB Type-C port, and from offering all the necessary sensors to opting for a beefy 5,000mAh battery – all of this are examples of the same And when you put these two things together with the attractive starting price of Rs 10,999 (Rs 12,999 for the higher-end, 4GB RAM model that I’ve reviewed), Samsung may very well have a winner on its hands. That’s not to say that the device doesn’t face any competition – quite the opposite actually. As is evident from the processor benchmark comparison, the handset is up against a flurry of devices – including the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2 (review), Realme U1 (review), Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro (review), and Honor 10 Lite (review). Each of these devices are better in some aspect or the other (if not all) when compared to the Galaxy M20, making it really hard to choose one.  Yet, none of these rivals can match up to the brand equity of Samsung (though Xiaomi comes quite close, especially as far as netizens are concerned). On its own, the M20 scores well on almost all aspects, right from the gorgeous display, good cameras, and powerful internals, to the long-lasting battery. And if you round that off with an affordable price, the Samsung Galaxy M20 becomes an automatic choice for those who’re looking for a reliable daily driver. Photos by Raj Rout"
2461,30,33552,3.5,5,2019-03-27,,33552,Nitansh Rastogi -,Samsung Galaxy M30 review: triple-camera goodness in the sub-Rs 15k segment,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-m30-review?pid=33552," A couple of years back, Samsung seemingly followed the mantra “throw everything at the wall, and see what sticks“. However, in 2019, I think this could be changed to “throw those things at the wall, which will definitely stick“. To say that the Korean behemoth has been under immense pressure – not just from Xiaomi, the current number one smartphone maker in India, but also other players like OPPO, Vivo and the new entrant Realme – would be an understatement. In 2019 however, the Chaebol seems to be taking the fight to the competition in a concerted manner. In fact, Samsung has already launched more than half a dozen smartphones this year and the first quarter of 2019 isn’t even over yet. The assault started with the Galaxy M10 (review) and M20 (review) which were part of the brand’s strategy to cater to millennials, with the latest offering in the series being the Galaxy M30 (first impressions). Having reviewed the Galaxy M20, I was quite excited to check out its pricier sibling and I have to say that Samsung has managed to impress yet again. Wondering why I’m saying that? Read on to find out in this review of the Samsung Galaxy M30.Considering that the Samsung Galaxy M30 is currently the most affordable smartphone with triple rear cameras, let’s start the review by taking a look at the handset’s imaging prowess. But before that, here’s a look at what the setup includes – a 13-megapixel shooter, an 8MP wide-angle lens and a 5MP sensor for depth-sensing purposes. Of course, you also get an LED flash for shooting in dim settings. At the front, the device ships with a 16-megapixel snapper.In terms of the camera interface, there’s no difference from the one on the M20. That means, all the options are nicely laid out, and switching between normal and wide-angle mode also requires just a single tap. But of course, you’d be interested in knowing about the picture quality. Well, I’m glad to tell you that the Samsung Galaxy M30 won’t disappoint you with its image quality. Images shot in daylight have a high level of detail, and the colours are also reproduced quite accurately. The close-ups are pleasing as well, though the phone struggles in focusing in close quarters and autofocusing isn’t blazingly fast either. Sadly, low light isn’t the phone’s strongest suit as the sensor overexposes light sources, which takes away from the otherwise decent images (unless of course, you zoom in and see the grains). The wide-angle sensor however, is certainly what makes the M30 stand apart from its peers as not many devices can boast of this feature. It can give you a much wider perspective of the scene in front of you, though you need to compromise on sharpness and autofocusing ability in this mode. The fish-eye effect can be fixed with the use of the ‘Shape Correction’ option in the Gallery. Then there’s the depth sensor that ensures that you get a better depth-of-field effect with the subject being nicely separated from a blurred-out background. You also get the ability to control the amount of blur to ensure that you don’t get an artificial-looking image. I’ll now let the pictures do the talking, so without further ado, here’s a look at the camera samples of the Galaxy M30. There’s no doubt that Samsung’s offering will draw most comparisons with Xiaomi’s 48-megapixel rear camera-toting Redmi Note 7 Pro, so if you’re wondering how these two phones stack up against each other, then I do have an answer for you. In daylight, while the M30 isn’t far behind, the shots captured by the Note 7 Pro are simply sharper and more vibrant, and no, you don’t need to click in the 48MP resolution to get such a high level of detail. In dim settings, the Sony IMX586 sensor in the Redmi Note 7 Pro does a brilliant job by combining four pixels into one to offer much better sharpness and colour reproduction. The M30 also loses out on the video recording front when compared to the Note 7 Pro, as the former can only capture up to full HD videos, while the latter supports up to 4k. But the footage is surely quite good and smooth, thanks to the inclusion of EIS. The Galaxy M30 also comes out ahead in selfie capabilities thanks to a better sensor, which ensures well-detailed, natural-looking images. The Live Focus mode to get the depth effect for selfies also works surprisingly well.  In terms of the build quality and looks, the Samsung Galaxy M30 isn’t much different from its siblings. You get the same, high screen-to-body ratio, thanks to an Infinity-V display panel and plasticky finish on the rear. That said, there are some subtle differences that make the M30 more attractive.  First and foremost, the South Korean giant has opted for a two-tone gradient finish on the back of the M30 that gives it a distinct characteristic. While you’ll find the blue colour on the upper portion – similar to the M10 and M20 – there’s a darker shade towards the bottom. The good thing is that the gradient is present on the sides too. Another interesting thing you’ll notice is the ring around the secondary camera of the M30, which is a rather nice touch, if you ask me.  Other than that, the M30 has exactly the same design elements as its younger brothers (except for featuring a triple-camera array on the rear). What this also means is that the phone offers good ergonomics, thanks to the slightly curved edges and rounded corners. Along with the fast and accurate fingerprint reader, the device can also be unlocked with your face. While I won’t say that the the phone isn’t slippery, it certainly offers a better grip than glass-back phones. Not to mention that the Galaxy M30 is also able to keep fingerprints at bay, at least when compared to handsets with glass-sandwich design sence. Plus, you even get the Always-on display feature which negates the need to picking up the phone every time to check your notifications.This is yet another area where the M30 doesn’t differ much from the M20. The phone draws power from the Exynos 7904 chipset, which works in tandem with 4GB / 6GB of RAM. Like I said in my review of the M20, the octa-core processor is more than capable of handling day-to-day tasks and multitasking is good too on the 4GB RAM model I reviewed. And while games like PUBG run fine, the handset does run into frame drops every now and then, and that too with medium graphics settings. Thankfully, thermals are kept in check and the phone only feels slightly warm after gaming for 30 to 40 minutes.  Taking care of your storage needs is 64GB memory onboard, which spares around 50.5GB for the end user. Courtesy a dedicated microSD card slot, you can expand the storage further by up to 512GB. At the time of the launch of the M10 and M20, the phonemaker hadn’t launched smartphones with its new and refreshed One UI. But since then, Samsung has introduced the S10 lineup and the A series, both of which boot One UI out of the box. Which is why, it’s perplexing to see the M30 continuing with Experience UI 9.5, which is based on the last-gen Android 8.1 Oreo. As far as pre-installed apps go, you get My Galaxy, Samsung Max, and Galaxy Apps, among others. You also get a prompt to install more apps while setting up the device, but thankfully you can choose not to.    Of course, the battery continues to be the trump card of the M30. Similar to the M20, it comes with a 5,000mAh cell, which ensures that the phone can last more than a day of use and then some more. This reflected in our battery loop test as well, as the smartphone was able to playback an HD video on a loop non-stop for around 17 hours. And when you need to juice it up, you’ll be able to do that in a little more than two hours, thanks to the bundled 15W adapter. To say that Samsung has made a solid comeback in the race would be underplaying the South Korean titan’s efforts. Within less than three months into 2019, the company has turned the Indian smartphone market on its head. It’s clear that the brand won’t let go of the numero uno position out of its sights, and that Chinese brands will have to work harder to grab its market share. The Galaxy M30 continues that stance by bringing never-seen-before features in the sub-Rs 15k segment. With an asking price of Rs 14,999 for its base model, it’s a solid all-round offering.  Having said that, the price tag pits the device squarely against the Redmi Note 7 Pro (review). And, Xiaomi does know a thing or two to entice spec-obsessed buyers. Due to the Redmi Note 7 Pro’s more powerful Snapdragon 675 SoC, high-res 48MP rear camera, and a sticker price that’s Rs 1,000 lower, it becomes hard to recommend the Galaxy M30. Then there are options like the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2 (review), which are also quite powerful. The upcoming Realme 3 Pro should also be a loaded offering in this price bracket, if its predecessor is anything to go by.  All said and done, the Galaxy M30 has definitely turned up the heat in the Rs 15,000 category and is among the best buys in the category.

2156,30,30059,,,2017-10-03,,30059,Nitansh Rastogi -,Samsung Galaxy Note8 review: the phoenix rises,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-note8-review?pid=30059," Let’s get the obvious out of the way – the Korean giant Samsung had a forgetful 2016. The Samsung Galaxy Note7 made waves, not necessarily because of being an excellent package, but because of its defective batteries. The massive fiasco led many to believe that the brand will be shelving off the Note series, but Samsung chose to go ahead with a successor. Enter the Note8. Released last month, the device has a lot riding on its tall shoulders. While Samsung might have single-handedly created a market for large-screen devices, it’s not the only player now. So the new Note is not just tasked with salvaging the reputation of the series, but also needs to fend off the competition. Has it been successful? That’s what I’m here to find out. So without further ado, let’s begin.   The numero uno manufacturer has been offering two separate flagship lineups annually – the Galaxy S series and the Note range. While the devices are targeted at different consumer segments, the latest Note8 is eerily similar to the S8 duo (more so with the bigger S8+). In fact, if you don’t need the S Pen – the hallmark of the Note series – then I’d suggest you to stick with the Samsung Galaxy S8+ (review), which by the way, recently received a price cut. However, there’s another key distinction that the new Note8 brings – dual cameras, which will be the key focus areas in the next section. But are these differences enough to warrant spending Rs 67,900 on? Especially when you consider the fact that Apple’s upcoming iPhone X is being regarded as “the future of the smartphone”? Many questions cloud the mind, and most of the answers lie in how good the Samsung Galaxy Note8 is in real life.Samsung’s Galaxy S8 twins pushed the envelope for smartphone designs with their Infinity displays, metal frames and shiny glass backs. The Note8 carries that forward, albeit in a slightly larger form factor. It’s the largest smartphone in the Note series ever, with its display panel measuring 6.3-inches diagonally – 0.1-inch bigger than the S8+.  However, instead of the display curving almost half-way towards the edges of the S8+, the Note8’s display panel doesn’t curve as much. The same story continues at the back as well. Similarly, instead of rounded corners of its cousin, the smartphone sports squared-off corners, giving it a boxy look. All that helps in improving the ergonomics of the Samsung Galaxy Note8. You can hold it comfortably in the hand and gripping it is easier as well. However, it must be mentioned that the phablet is quite tall, and using it is a two-hand affair. Tipping the scales at 195g, it weighs on the higher side too. Add to it the fact that the glassy panel at the rear – as good as it looks by reflecting the light in all the directions – is extremely slippery and acts as a powerful fingerprint and smudge magnet.  Thankfully though, Samsung is bundling a transparent case in the retail box of the Galaxy Note8. Not only does the case ensure that the looks of the phone aren’t spoilt, it also makes it grip-friendly and keeps fingerprints at bay. Coming to the placement of controls and ports, you won’t find anything new. The power toggle is on the right edge, and sitting opposite it is the Bixby key. Above it, you’ll find the volume rocker. The top panel is home to the ejectable tray that hides a nano-SIM card slot and a hybrid slot, along with a noise-cancellation mic. The bottom is quite packed – along with a 3.5mm interface (thankfully, the brand hasn’t ditched it yet), you’ll find a USB-Type C port, a primary microphone, a speaker grille, and of course, a dedicated silo for keeping the S Pen. As was the case with its predecessors, the stylus can be ejected by a single press. There are no physical keys either, as they are available as part of the software. However, it’s the home button that’s quite powerful thanks to its pressure-sensitivity as you can simply long-press its location from any app to jump to the homescreen.All this is fine and dandy, but Samsung hasn’t changed one thing that was our major gripe with the Samsung Galaxy S8’s… the position of the fingerprint sensor. Embedded right beside the camera, it was difficult to access in the S8 duo – and with the Note8, it requires even more effort. More often than not, you end up smudging the camera sensors in a bid to unlock the phone. However, when you do get it right, the device unlocks instantly and it works almost every time. Personally, I’d have liked the fingerprint module to be available below the cameras, since it seems that the in-display fingerprint readers are still some time away. Don’t be disappointed though, as there are other ways to authenticate yourself and I’ll be discussing them in the software section. Available in colour options of black and gold, the Samsung Galaxy Note8 looks gorgeous from all angles –  be it the display stretching towards the edges, or the shiny rear. You don’t need to worry about nicks and accidental drops either, as both the front and back are protected by a layer of latest-gen Corning Gorilla Glass. And the phone is a perfect companion for the monsoons too, as it’s impervious to dust and water, all thanks to IP68 certification.  The Galaxy Note8’s window to the world is its large 6.3-inch display with a wide-screen aspect ratio of 18.5:9. Samsung’s display panels are always best-in-class, and the one on its latest flagship goes one step ahead. With a Super AMOLED tech and resolution of 2,960x 1,440 pixels (also referred to as 3K resolution), it delivers darker blacks, impressive contrast levels and sharp text. At 1,200 nits, the brightness levels are the highest ever in a smartphone, which means you can easily use the Note8 even under harsh sunlight. To top it off, the device is capable of playing HDR videos as it’s certified with Mobile HDR Premium standard. While watching such content is an immersive experience, the reality is that very few streaming services offer HDR videos. The limited list includes YouTube, Netflix and Amazon Prime on which you can find some HDR-compliant titles. There’s a Bluelight filter too to ensure that you can use the phone at night without straining your eyes. While the unique screen aspect ratio makes the Note8 a delight to consume content, the problem is that most apps and videos aren’t optimised for this format. And since Samsung lets you use the app or watch videos in this format, some text on the edges gets cut. Samsung has usually been the trendsetter in the world of smartphones, but when it comes to dual cameras, it’s taken its own sweet time to join the club. In fact, it has boarded the bandwagon almost an year after Apple, which started offering a pair of snappers with the iPhone 7 Plus for the first time. The Galaxy Note8 flaunts a pair of 12-megapixel shooters at the rear, with the primary 26mm f/1.7 sensor being the same as the one on the S8 twins and the secondary one being a telephoto f/2.4 sensor with 52mm size. What makes them special is the fact that both of them have OIS, which ensures that your handshakes are minimised to offer good pictures in low-light and smoother videos. The dual-camera array works exactly same as the iPhone’s, i.e. offering you the ability to get closer to the subject with 2X optical zoom and ensure that your subject with the rest of the background with what brand dubs as the Live Focus mode. You also get fast autofocusing thanks to the dual-pixel technology. Coming to the quality, I don’t really need to tell you about the impressive pictures you can get with the primary snapper on the Samsung Galaxy Note8, since we have already applauded the S8 and S8+ for this. Irrespective of the situation, you get sharp results with peppy colours. They look unnatural due to the saturation, but also, quite pleasing to the eyes. The long shots do complete justice to the length and breadth of the scene, while you can get some amazing macro shots with some depth-of-field effects as well thanks to the wide aperture. HDR adds more life to the scene without making it look too artificial, and pictures taken at night also offer a good amount of detail. There’s a dual-colour LED flash as well, to illuminate the scene. Wow, all that sounds like I’m in love with the Note8’s camera, and I haven’t even started talking about the secondary camera at the back. But before that, let’s discuss the camera interface. Samsung has always offered a ton of options in the viewfinder, but with the Note8, it has not only kept the UI choc-a-bloc, but in order to save space has used the same place for multiple functions. There are some redundant buttons too. All this makes it quite confusing to use the camera, and requires a bit of a learning curve. In the portrait mode, you get the option to shoot a picture or a video, along with previewing the clicks. What’s baffling however, is the fact that there are two shutter buttons, with the one at the centre doubling up as a zoom option (both optical, and then digital zoom of up to 10x), and the other can float anywhere on the screen (you can disable it though). Up top, you get the ability to switch to the front camera, enable full screen (which is really useful and lets you utilise the entire display), toggle the flash and access settings. Sadly, there’s no HDR button up front, and you need to go to the settings to activate it. However, you can also turn it to auto and the phone will automatically capture the dynamic range depending upon the scene. Just above the shutter button you’ll find an option for Live Focus, Bixby Vision (to detect products or monuments in front of you) and Stickers. Above that you’ll find the option to zoom 2x into the subject, but interestingly the same spot also shows the exposure controls, so you can’t zoom and then adjust the exposure immediately, or vice versa. Swipe to the left and you’ll find various modes such as Pro, Food, Hyperlapse, etc.    The implementation of dual cameras for providing an optical zoom-like functionality is my favourite (right after the wide-angle feature available on the LG’s flagships) since it lets you get closer to the subject without actually moving yourself. However, do note that the quality takes a hit in this instance as the secondary camera on the Galaxy Note8’s rear isn’t as good as the primary one. The Live Focus mode is quite interesting… not necessarily in terms of its working, but because of the flexibility it offers. Unlike Apple, Samsung lets you control the amount of blur so that the image doesn’t look too artificial. That’s not all, you can also change it post shooting by editing it, and if you don’t like the image at all, then you can check the normal picture too as the Note8 captures the same scene with the primary snapper as well. That said, Live Focus works well when you get it right, but in most other scenarios, even using the primary sensor gives you nicely blurred backgrounds when clicked from the minimal focusing distance thanks to the aperture of f/1.7. Now it’s time to let the pictures do the talking, so here are some camera samples for you to gawk upon. Click here to check the images in the full resolution You can record some impressive videos from the phablet as well, with the OIS ensuring that the footage remains smooth. Professionals will also love the ability to click the RAW images. Coming to the selfies, the Samsung Galaxy Note8 might not win in terms of the resolution, the 8MP f/1.7 snapper does offer good images. You can also enable the screen flash to shoot in dim environments. As much as the Note series is about its powerful hardware, software plays an equally important role in making it a workhorse and a productivity-centric offering. The Chaebol has ensured that the Galaxy Note8 takes things to the next level, with its latest Samsung Experience v8.5 running atop Android 7.1.1 Nougat.    Over the years, the brand has moved away from loading its phones with bloatware and gimmicky software, and to that extent, you won’t find many preloaded apps on the Galaxy Note8. It only comes with Microsoft’s suite of apps, including Word, Powerpoint, and OneNote among others. Interface-wise, it’s similar to the S8 duo, including the fact that you can now open the app menu by a simple swipe in the upward direction – just like the Pixel launcher. Although, it feels really odd that for going to the next screen, you need to swipe towards the left and not upwards. Since the phone has a curved display, you can use the edge panels to access certain apps or reach contacts. But where the Note8 really shines is the feature called App Pair, which lets you open two apps simultaneously with a single tap. Thanks to the big screen and the widescreen aspect ratio, this is one of the best ways to enjoy the split-screen functionality. I loved writing notes while watching videos on YouTube, or checking Twitter and chatting at the same time.    The left-most screen in the homescreen is dedicated for Bixby, Samsung’s intelligent assistant. It acts as a one-stop screen to provide you with your schedule, show reminders, display the images clicked by you on that day along with connecting with your Facebook, Twitter and YouTube accounts to show the latest updates and notifications. It also has a news section, which is powered by Flipboard. These cards can be customised as per your liking. This seems to be a logical successor to Samsung’s Briefing screen, and the one that’s quite useful. To access it, you can also press the dedicated Bixby button available on the left. Sadly though, this key can’t be remapped to any other action, but Samsung does allow you to disable it altogether.   But the usefulness of Bixby doesn’t end here. During the course of my review, Samsung rolled out an update to its virtual assistant to understand voice commands, and that’s where it adds a lot to the user experience. It’s not too different from smart assistants like Google Now and Siri, but the Korean titan has tried to make it more deft with system-related skills. From setting up alarms to opening an app to reading messages, it’s quite capable. The only thing it lags behind is in searching for something on the web, but then, being an Android device, you can always use Google Now for that. I’ve just started exploring Bixby and it’s pretty good in understanding my diction and works accurately more often than not. It does take a while for processing though. Another interesting thing about Bixby is that it has a gamification feature built in, as you can gain experience points for interacting with it. This is by no way an in-depth review of how well the Bixby works and what all can you use it for, but if you want us to cover that, do let us know in the comments below.    Remember I told you that fingerprints aren’t the only way to authenticate yourself, as there are two more methods, apart from the good ol’ pattern and pin unlock. You can use the Note8’s face recognition or iris scanning features to unlock it. I’ve used both of them, and my personal preference is the latter. While face recognition works quite well, it won’t work at all in poor lighting and it’s not completely secure as well, since there have been reports that it can be fooled by a picture or a video of the face (Apple’s Face ID feature on the iPhone X is supposed to have taken care of all these issues). Iris scanner in comparison, is better… when it works that is. You’ll need to familiarise yourself with the optimum position, which isn’t very close or far. While it does take some time to process, the good thing is that it works even in low light. My suggestion would be to use both the iris recognition and fingerprint reader as unlocking mechanisms and use them as per your convenience.  Of course, the Note smartphones are known for their note-taking capabilities, and that brings me to my next point… The S Pen remains a key differentiator between the Note series and the Galaxy S range, and rightly so. It’s one thing that has ensured loyal followers for the Note series, and for them, the S Pen functionality with the Note8 is second to none. Not only it’s more accurate now thanks to 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity, it’s also improved upon its much-loved features.  Like its predecessors, you get a variety of features at your disposal as soon as you eject the S Pen. These include Smart Select, Screen Write, and Translate, among dozen others. The first feature that got an improvement is the ability to write as soon as you take out the stylus even when the display is asleep. Dubbed Screen off memo, you can write up to 100 pages in this mode, and the best part is that you can pin them on your screen as well, thanks to the Always-On Display functionality of the Note8. Isn’t this useful for reminding yourself while going for a grocery shopping or making your to-do list?  If you enjoy making memes, then you’ll like the Smart Select feature which lets you capture up to 15 seconds of a clip from a video, and then share it as a GIF. Live Message, as the name suggests, makes your message interactive, wherein you can make your own emojis or animate the photos and share them via messaging services. Then there’s a Translate feature which unlike earlier, lets you translate entire paragraphs instead of using word-by-word translation. You can also use this capability for doing currency conversions.   With its 0.7mm tip, the S Pen can be used to doodle or write precisely. And it’s really good for selecting text, annotating documents or glancing at messages or emails without even opening them, and much more. That said, you’ll either use the S Pen or you don’t, and if you fall in the latter camp, then you might not find it that useful. 2017’s flagships have followed a set formula when it comes to their internals, and the Samsung Galaxy Note8 sticks to that. The Indian variant draws power from the brand’s in-house Exynos 8895 SoC, which is similar to the Snapdragon 835 chipset, and is built using a 10nm FinFET process. It has two quad-core clusters running at 2.3GHz and 1.7GHz. Unlike the S8 and S8+ however, the Note8 gets an additional 2 gigs of RAM as it comes with 6GB capacity. The additional RAM does help a lot in terms of multi-tasking or while using App Pair. Otherwise too, there are hardly any tasks that can tax the powerful hardware combination. Add to it the Mali-G71 MP20 GPU and the gaming experience is amazing. I lost track of time while playing Contest of Champions and Asphalt 8: Airborne, and the phablet delivered incredible graphics and didn’t show any traces of lag.  Another good thing about the smartphone was its thermal efficiency. Even after long sessions of gaming, it didn’t heat up at all. However, I did run into heating issues twice – using GPS and Google Maps for navigation while driving with songs being streamed via 4G for about an hour. The temperature was so much that the phone showed overheating warning and prompted that the app which I was using would be closed to ensure that it cools down a bit first.   While I didn’t really have any complaints with the performance section, there were times when there was a split-second delay in execution of tasks. Changing the orientation while using the multi-window feature, for instance. Targeted at power users, the Galaxy Note8 ships with 64GB of memory on board that can be extended further with the use of a microSD card (supports up to 256GB capacity). After accounting for OS and other resources, the phone offers around 52GB of space.  Connectivity-wise, the Note8 doesn’t miss out on anything. It supports 4G VoLTE, offers dual SIM cards )although the secondary slot is of hybrid type), dual-band Wi-Fi, NFC, Bluetooth 5.0 and GPS. As can be expected, voice calls work splendidly as well.  For all its screen and pitch as a multimedia offering, the Samsung Galaxy Note8 misses out on stereo speakers. Moreover, the position of the single-firing speaker at the bottom of the phone means that it easily gets muffled when used in the landscape mode – which is what most people will use it in while watching movies or playing games. That said, the sound output is quite loud and crisp.  The Samsung Galaxy Note8 comes bundled with a pair of AKG-tuned earphones, and they’re really good. As they are in-ear type, you can wear them comfortably for long durations. The braided cable exudes quality and durability, and ensures that they don’t get tangled easily. In terms of the sound quality, the pair delivers an impressive output, although it’s attuned towards bass. If you are like me who likes listening to EDM and songs with thump, then you’ll definitely like them. Well, this is the aspect where the Note7 faltered, and Samsung has already promised that all its batteries now follow a stringent 8-point check. So you shouldn’t worry about the Note8 meeting the same fate. That said, it seems that the company has still played it safe as even though its latest flagship is larger than the S8+, it packs in a 3,300mAh battery – 200mAh lesser than the one fuelling the latter.   The impact of lower capacity is apparent in the runtime of the Samsung Galaxy Note8. It just manages to last an entire working day if used judiciously. And this is when the display resolution was set at FHD+ (2,220 x 1,080) and not WQHD+. Charged at 100 percent at 8 am in the morning, it dropped to less than 5 percent till the time I reach home with my usage comprising navigation via GPS, 4G running in the background, streaming music, 15 to 20 minutes of gaming, and a few calls. I usually got around three and a half hour of screen on time, which is just about average. The good thing however, is that the phone supports quick charging and quick wireless charging (you need to purchase the charger separately). It can be juiced up fully in about an hour and 45 minutes with the bundled adapter. In the end, everything boils down to this. Should you loosen up your purse strings for the Samsung Galaxy Note8 – which at Rs 67,999 is the most expensive Android smartphone you can buy currently? It all depends on what are you looking for from your smartphone. If you like cutting-edge technology and money is no bar for you, then you probably should wait for the Apple iPhone X. But if you want a smartphone that gets most of the things right, from the design to the internals, and from the display to the cameras, along with packing some extras, and are willing to pay a premium – then I have another question for you. Do you need the S Pen? If the answer is yes, then you can surely go for the Galaxy Note8.  But if the answer is no, then you can get almost the same experience with the Galaxy S8+. You can also choose to wait for the upcoming LG V30 (first impressions), which has made many of my colleagues excited with its 6-inch POLED display, powerful hardware and focus on audiophiles. All said and done, the Samsung Galaxy Note8 is possibly the best smartphone out there if you are willing to compromise on the battery life, and of course, the only option, if you love the functionality of the S Pen.       Photos by Raj Rout"
2474,30,32748,,,2019-02-26,,32748,Deepak Dhingra -,Samsung Galaxy S10+ review: an all-rounder of a flagship,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-review?pid=32748," I’d probably be stumped for words if you were to ask me one headlining feature of the new Samsung Galaxy S10+ (first impressions). Is it the new HDR10+ capable display? Or the ultrasonic in-screen fingerprint scanner? Or the new triple camera setup at the back? Or is it the Infinity-O notch that hides dual selfie cameras? Or the fact that you can get one with a gargantuan 1 terabyte of native storage, packing in no less than 12 gigs of RAM? As I mull over this, let me take you through how the latest torchbearer of Samsung’s S series fares as a daily driver  Design wise, the Galaxy S10+ seems a more refined version of the brand’s previous flagships, the Galaxy Note9 and the Galaxy S9+. Layered with glass on both sides, the mainstay of the S10+ design is the all-screen fascia, which uses what Samsung calls an Infinity-O display…. with the ‘O’ in that moniker referring to the punch-hole notch. In the case of the S10+, said notch hides not one, but two selfie cameras. While I’ve gotten used to different kinds of notches on phones, I have to admit that the large hole on one side of the S10+’s screen does take a little more time to get used to as compared to a traditional cut-out or a waterdrop notch, looking like a pair of eyes peering back at times. Samsung has done well to hide it by using dark wallpapers, but the hole does make its presence felt when you change the wallpaper or use apps with lighter backgrounds, such as Gmail for instance. That said, the punch-hole does have a very nifty animation that encircles it while using face unlock Switch to the rear and the triple-camera module draws attention immediately. The horizontally-arranged cameras are placed inside a module that juts out a little bit, and since it’s placed in the centre, the phone doesn’t wobble when kept on a flat surface – even though there’s a risk of it getting scratched when you do so. The placement of ports and controls is typical for a Samsung flagship, and you even get a dedicated Bixby button on the left. If you were to ask me though, I’d say the star of the show is the 3.5mm headset socket placed on the bottom. Kudos to Samsung for still supporting this interface, despite it being archaic and unsightly. The likes of Apple, Huawei, Google and even OnePlus have all given up on it, but it’s good to see that Samsung still wants to give its users the convenience of being able to connect any pair of wired headphones directly to its latest flagship without resorting to a fiddly, easy-to-misplace dongle. Maybe I’m making a big deal out of this (and I’m not even a music buff), but I’m sure many out there would appreciate this feature. In fact, I’m so pleased about the inclusion of the headset jack that I’m going to go ahead and count it as one of the positives. The display is also where the Galaxy S10+ shines. The 6.4-inch, 19:9 display curves on both sides, offers QHD+ resolution, and utilises AMOLED tech. Samsung likes to call this screen Dynamic AMOLED, and that’s because the screen on the Galaxy S10+ is the world’s first to support HDR10+ on a smartphone. Displays with HDR10+ support (mainly TVs before the Galaxy S10 range came out) can control dynamic range while playing compatible content on a frame by frame basis, and Samsung is actually one of the founding partners of the HDR10+ Alliance. Content encoded in this format is hard to come by as of now, but long story short, buying a Galaxy S10+ ensures your purchase is future proof and you should be able to get a more immersive experience while viewing compatible videos. In any case, Samsung is known for the vivid displays on its phones, and the one on the S10+ is simply the best in the business – offering black blacks, colourful colours and a general sense of happiness when you’re watching high-res videos or playing graphics-heavy games. The display gets plenty bright and looks great. In short, a visual treat.The screen, in fact, also hides another innovation – an in-display ultrasonic fingerprint scanner. Unlike the optical under-display fingerprint scanners found on phones like the OnePlus 6T, which use light to create a 2D image of your fingerprint for authentication, the ultrasonic scanner creates a 3D map using pulses of sound. This tech is supposed to be more secure than optical under-display scanners. In real-life usage, the under-display fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S10+ works well for the most part. You need to place your finger on the sweet spot for it to work, and it still isn’t as fast as good ol’ capacitive scanners, but that said, works accurately and speedily. One downside to the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner is that it may not work too well if you have a screen protector installed, but in theory, protectors up to 1.5mm in thickness should work fine. I’m going to put that to the test very soon myself and update this review once I have more on this. By the way, all this discussion about the fingerprint scanner is of no real value if you’re just going to use face unlock on the S10+ – the feature is there for you to use and works pretty well, and is quite fast too.Related read: Samsung Galaxy S10 Ultrasonic fingerprint sensor Next up, the all important cameras. Two 12MP, optically stabilised sensors (with one of them being telephoto for up to 2X zoom) mated to a 16MP ultra wide sensor make up the triple cam array on the back, while selfies are taken care of by a 10-meg snapper paired with an 8MP depth sensor. An extensive Pro mode with the option to save stills in RAW, super slow mo video, hyperlapse, Live Focus (Samsung’s version of Portrait mode) and food are some of the modes available to shoot in. The Live Focus mode allows you to control the intensity of background blur and even apply some interesting filters, both while shooting as well as post capture.    Then there’s the AI-based Scene Optimizer that detects the subject or scene being captured to optimise setting spontaneously, and even a Shot suggestions feature that helps you line up shots and click automatically when you follow its suggestions. I found the latter to be a bit of an annoyance frankly, since it kept asking me to frame my shots differently than what I desired, but I guess it could be useful for some. The Scene Optimizer is definitely more useful, and despite the AI taking a moment to two longer to recognise the scene in the frame, seems to work quite well.There are tons of other features, such as Flaw detection, motion photos, tracking autofocus, colour filters, AR Emoji, stickers, et al. The Galaxy S10+ can also shoot 4K video at 60 fps, though if you choose a lower frame rate or resolution, you can make use of the video stabilisation that does wonders to control jitter if you’re shooting from a moving vehicle or while walking. Not just that, the S10+ can even shoot video in HDR10+. Speaking of video, the footage I captured using the S10+ looked pretty good. Related read: Samsung Galaxy S10 cameras explainedBefore I give you a look at some of the stills I captured using the Galaxy S10+, let me tell you that it’s a solid, all-rounder of a shooter. While I think the Google Pixel 3 XL (and the Pixel 3) is a better shooter overall, scoring higher in low light and offering more natural-looking portraits, the Galaxy S10+ excels in almost all shooting conditions and captures excellent images. Here’s a quick comparison.                 And while I’m on the subject of comparison, here’s a look at a couple of shots that show how the Galaxy S10+ shoots in comparison to the Apple iPhone XS Max.   ultra-wide angle mode is super useful, allowing you to capture a larger area and get more into your frame without moving. As far as selfies are concerned, the 10MP snapper may not be the most powerful out there but captures nice selfies, adding blur when you want it (using the Live Focus mode) and even giving you a wide angle option. A picture says a thousand words, so let me lay out a few million words for you below, in the form of pictures shot using the Samsung Galaxy S10+.der a rock, you’d know that the India launch of this music streaming service is due anytime now. Maybe Samsung and Spotify are in cahoots and planning for a joint launch in India… let’s see if that happens.   The Edge Panels are there, and so are the other usual signature Samsung features like Bixby Home, Always-on display, smart capture, game launcher, video enhancer, etc. A new addition is Bixby Routines, which allow you to automate phone behaviour based on triggers that you specify. While power users would appreciate this best, it’s pretty simple to create a custom routine that switches your phone to vibrate and changes your lock screen shortcuts to Calendar and Email when you reach office, or switches off data and Wi-Fi, and reduces screen brightness at a predefined time at night.  Samsung’s implementation of the gesture interface is quite fiddly though, and while I did give it a shot, I quickly switched back to the default navigation buttons. Basically, the gesture interface takes you home when you swipe up from the middle of the bottom of the screen (which is the way it works on most phones), but for going back you have to swipe up from the right, while an upward swipe from left bottom gives you your recent apps. It’s a tad confusing, to say the least.  The octa-core, 8nm Exynos 9820 under the hood of the Samsung Galaxy S10+ (folks in the US get Snapdragon 855 instead), mated to 8 gigs of RAM in my review unit, makes mince meat of anything and everything thrown at it, and turns in smooth performance regardless of the app or game at hand. Furthermore, thanks to Vapor cooling, thermals are kept in check, and the phone just gets a tad warm when stressed (read: while playing intensive games). Worth noting that the Galaxy S10+ also comes in a 12GB RAM version. That much RAM is overkill in my opinion, but said variant also offers a whopping 1 terabyte of native storage, which is a world first and despite its crazy high price tag, quite cool to have in your pocket, if only for bragging rights.    There’s a 4,100mAh battery inside the Galaxy S10+, though you wouldn’t believe that just by looking at the phone – it’s just so sleek. After a full day of shooting, and using the phone as a hotspot for about four hours straight, interspersed with a few sessions of listening to music, web browsing and general fooling around, I returned late in the night with about 30 percent juice in the tank. In our video loop battery drain test, the phone lasted 16.5 hours. That’s a very good result, and I can safely say that unless your usage is very heavy, the phone’s battery should see you till the end of day comfortably. Adaptive fast charging is supported, and the phone also supports two-way wireless charging. That means that not only can the phone be juiced up wirelessly, it can reverse charge other phones (those that feature wireless charging) and other supported gadgets sans wires too, just like the Huawei Mate 20 Pro. The Galaxy S10+ is IP68 certified too, like most other premium flagships. The Galaxy S10+ isn’t a revolutionary device, and put simply, takes the best features from its predecessors, adds the latest trends, mixes them well, and delivers a solid, compelling phone that ticks most boxes right. It may not be the best shooter out there (Google, what sorcery have you done with the solitary snapper on the Pixel 3?), or boast features that can make for 72-point headlines, but it does make a strong case for itself. I think the Huawei Mate 20 Pro (review) comes the closest to the Galaxy S10+ as far as competition is concerned, and Huawei’s implementation of the triple cameras even looks more capable, and with its 3X zoom, more useful. However, the Mate 20 Pro does lose a few points because of its selfie camera that leaves something to be desired, lack of a headphone jack and its EMUI platform. I could be nitpicking here, but the fact remains that the Mate 20 Pro is still a great choice and the only one among the current lot of premium flagships that can challenge the Galaxy S10+. You should also keep in mind that MWC is currently on in full swing, and we’re expecting tons of new-age smartphones to come our way soon. The penta-cam Nokia 9 PureView (first impressions) promises to up the photography game, and if the stars and planets align a certain way, we might even see the Xiaomi Mi 9 (first impressions) making its way to India. In short, the Samsung Galaxy S10+ is already facing threat from a battalion of powerful soldiers, and has its task cut out. To answer the question I posed at the very beginning, I still can’t think of a single feature that defines the Galaxy S10+. It’s just a solid, well balanced combination of good design, capable cameras, smooth performance and good battery life, all inside a package that doesn’t come cheap, but for anyone who spends their dough on it, should serve as a faithful daily driver that does most things right.

2477,30,33478,4,5,2019-03-28,,33478,Prateek Pandey -,Samsung Galaxy S10e review: the best compact smartphone of 2019,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s10e-review?pid=33478," “Here’s what we make of Samsung’s smallest and cheapest Galaxy flagship – the S10e The Samsung Galaxy S10e is – by far – the most intriguing smartphone launched in 2019 so far. I say this, because unlike most Android flagships, the handset doesn’t ship with a big display or tout an in-display fingerprint sensor. The S10e (first impressions) doesn’t offer a triple-camera array at the back like its pricier siblings either, nor does it ship with a capacious battery. But, what it does bring to the table is a compact footprint that’s unlike anything else on the market, especially in the premium flagship space. Therefore, if you were tempted to buy the S10e for its price, then don’t. You’ll want to buy the flagship for its size. Here’s why.   Coming from the OnePlus 6T (review), the design of the Samsung Galaxy S10e comes as a breath of fresh air. While both the devices feature all-glass bodies and therefore offer a comparable in-hand feel, the S10e’s compact frame makes it a godsend for one-handed usage. And, in my humble opinion, that’s the smartphone’s USP too. Simply put, there’s no other smartphone in the market which is as compact and as powerful as the S10e. You could make an argument for the Pixel 3, but even Google’s flagship towers above the S10e in terms of size by some margin – and that’s with a smaller, 5.5-inch display! Suffice it to say, I’ve really enjoyed coming back to a pint-sized smartphone. I didn’t realise how much I missed having all the information on the display within my thumb’s reach, or not letting my phone take up all the space inside the pocket of my jeans. At the expense of sounding like a broken record, I’ll reiterate – if you’ve longed for a compact Android flagship, then the S10e is where your money’s at.  Although the Galaxy S10e is Samsung’s most affordable superphone, the company has spared no expense in the design of the handset. In fact, barring its compact size, the S10e is identical to its pricier siblings in terms of design and has been styled using the same premium materials. The smartphone features glass on both the front as well as the back, coated with layers of Corning Gorilla Glass for protection against scuffs and scratches. The two glass panes are held together by an aluminium frame which is a tad-bit thicker on the S10e, primarily because the device doesn’t ship with a dual-curved display akin to its brethren. Now, the absence of curves on the front of the device takes away from the S10e’s ‘wow’ factor, but I don’t mind the change all that much. In fact, thanks to the handset’s thicker trim, the S10e is much more comfortable to grip in the hand. Moreover, I didn’t have to worry about accidental palm touches as much on the device either. So, I feel that buyers opting for the S10e will get the better part of the bargain. Other than that, the S10e ships with a stereo speaker setup which gets audaciously loud.There’s even a headphone jack at the bottom, which to my knowledge, is only found on Korean flagships now. And finally, much like the S10 and the S10+ (review), the S10e comes with support for wireless charging (and reverse wireless charging) and features IP68 certification. So, you can take it to your next Goa trip and get some incredible shots by the sea – or in it. While all that’s good and dandy, the best design element on the S10e is undoubtedly the smartphone’s capacitive fingerprint sensor, which unlike its siblings’ ultrasonic, in-display sensors, is blazingly fast and extremely accurate. The fingerprint scanner on the Galaxy S10e has been positioned underneath the power button on the right-hand trim of the device and it’s a joy to use. The unit unlocks the smartphone in a jiffy, lines up perfectly with my thumb, and it even brings down the notification tray when you swipe down on it.  And, for when you want to unlock the smartphone without lifting it up, you can use the face unlock feature to get into your home screen seamlessly. The software recognised my face nine times out of ten and it even works well in lowlight situations.  As much as I love the design of the phone, there are some issues I have with the build of the S10e. First and foremost, if you’re a leftie, then you might struggle to authenticate your fingerprints on the smartphone’s sensor as it’s mounted on the right-hand side of the frame. In this case, you might want to register the index finger of your left hand on the scanner. Secondly, the back of the smartphone smudges really easily, so you’ll have to wipe it down every now and then to keep it nice and shiny. Lastly, the S10e is quite slippery, so you might want to use the bundled case which comes with the device. In an attempt to keep the costs of the S10e down, Samsung has cut corners (no pun intended) in the display department too. Ergo, while the S10 and S10+ ship with sharper QHD+ displays, the S10e offers a modest 5.8-inch, full HD+ panel. That said, the panel on the S10e also features a punch hole to accommodate the selfie camera, akin to the displays on the bigger models which, in my opinion, is substantially less intrusive than a traditional notch. A fringe benefit of the same is that you’ll have a lot of fun using quirky wallpapers to hide the notch on the S10e. If you’re into that, then do check out Hidey Holes wallpaper app, which has a massive selection of creative walls designed specifically for the S10 lineup.    I have no complaints about the quality of the display either. It’s on par with the panels on the bigger variants in terms of quality and brightness, and I honestly didn’t notice the difference in resolution all that much. What’s more, since the display also comes with support for HDR 10+, you’ll be able to enjoy select content on the device with a wider range of colours. You’ll also get some nifty tools like an Always-On display and Edge lighting with the device, which will alert you about incoming calls or messages even when the phone is face down. The Samsung Galaxy S10e uses the same sensors to capture photos as its bigger siblings. However, unlike the S10 and the S10+, the device doesn’t feature a telephoto shooter at the back and relies on a 12MP shooter with a variable aperture of f/1.5 or f/2.4 and an ultrawide 16MP sensor with a 123-degree field of view. For selfies, the device gets a 10MP f/1.9 aperture lens on the front.  Although the S10e is a capable shooter, it’s just not in the same ballpark as the latest iPhones or Google’s Pixel 3 duo. In fact, on some occasions, my OnePlus 6T managed to capture a scene with more details. Over the years, Samsung has lost its mantle as the best camera phone maker to a host of other brands and I was hoping that the company’s 10th anniversary flagships could turn the tables in its favour. That being said, the S10e is not a bad shooter per se. In fact, unless you are pixel-peeping for details on the device, you’ll be content with the shots you take with the smartphone. I’ve summarised my experience with the smartphone’s cameras below, so take a gander. 1. As has been the case with Samsung’s flagships for many years now, the S10e captures photos which look rather pleasing to the eyes which can be attributed to the smartphone’s image processing. During the day, shots I took with the device exhibited peppy hues, which might not gel well with photographers who prefer more realism in their shots. However, since I like my pictures to be a tad bit over saturated, I wasn’t opposed to the photos that came out of the smartphone’s sensors. 2. The images I took with the device when the sun was out appeared sharp and had ample amount of details too. The dynamic range was flawless, and the smartphone managed to expose tricky shots evenly too. In fact, during my time with the device, I rarely ever had to dial the exposure up or down manually. Suffice it to say, if you don’t like to fiddle around with camera settings and want a phone which just takes beautiful photos, then the Samsung Galaxy S10e will not disappoint you. 3. I was particularly impressed with the smartphone’s focus tracking feature, which allowed me to capture some of the nicest macros of flowers in my garden. You see, even when it was windy outside, the smartphone didn’t lose focus on the petals of the flowers which allowed me to come away with gorgeous close-ups which were rich in details and colours. 4. Overall, daylight shots appeared surreal through the lenses of the S10e. Be it capturing a cloudy sky, or a sunset or taking a picture of your friends, the S10e’s cameras will seldom make you wish you had a better camera phone. The only issue I faced during my time with the device was that the ‘scene optimizer’ took a while to detect the scene and change the camera settings accordingly. 5. As I mentioned previously, the smartphone ships with a wide-angle sensor which does well for the most part. While the photos didn’t show any major fisheye effect, I noticed that they were stretched vertically. Regardless, the shooter did manage to capture a wider scene, and unlike the ultrawide shots from most other cameras, the S10e’s had a healthy amount of detail in them too.  6. Daylight selfies on the device look really good and at times, even outperformed the higher-resolution sensor on the OnePlus 6T. But, you’ll want to turn off the beautifying features else you’ll risk looking like a really sick patient. Portraits taken in the dark are about as serviceable as you’d get with other top phones. 7. As for lowlight photography, the Galaxy S10e is simply put, one of the best smartphones out there. In fact, barring the Pixel 3’s night sight, the smartphone managed to get away with a more presentable shot than most other Android (and iPhone) devices at night. There was minimal noise in the photos, which is expected from the smartphone’s f/1.5 aperture lens. Everything considered, the S10e is a fantastic pocket shooter but, it still cannot hold a candle to Google’s marvellous software processing. But then again, which phone can? Powering the smarts on the Samsung Galaxy S10e is the company’s latest 8nm, Exynos 9820 octa-core processor which works alongside 6GB of RAM and 128GB of built-in, user-expandable storage. Unfortunately, the company has reserved the higher RAM and storage models for the bigger S10 models, so if you’re looking for a bit more grunt under the hood, you might have to look there. That said, the performance on the S10e is quite good, and the handset only faltered when I was playing intensive titles on it.  During my time with the device, I didn’t run into any CPU bottlenecking. Applications opened in the blink of an eye and multitasking was rapid on the device as well. Moreover, thanks to Samsung’s refined One UI software, system gestures and animations were rendered seamlessly on the device too. My only gripe with the smartphone’s performance is that the Mali GPU which comes with the Exynos SoC isn’t as powerful as its Adreno counterpart. Consequently, there were some frame drops when I was playing PUBG at the HDR preset on the device. The game stuttered when I was jumping in and out of windows or when I was interacting with in-game items like boosters or first aid kits. What’s more, the smartphone doesn’t handle thermals very well and after just one Classic game of PUBG, the handset’s temperature spiked quite high, making the aluminium frame rather hot to the touch. The rise in temperature could have something to do with the handset’s small chassis as the CPU has lesser space to dissipate the heat but it just made the experience of gaming on the phone that much worse. Consequently, I relied on my OnePlus 6T whenever I felt the urge to knock down some chicken dinners.   The battery life on the Samsung Galaxy S10e has been a mixed bag for me. The handset is fuelled by a 3,100mAh battery which, on some days, lasted me the entire day on heavy usage. I’m talking multiple hours of browsing pages on Instagram and Facebook, constantly texting friends on WhatsApp, clicking photos, listening to music and streaming videos on Netflix. On others, the handset struggled to deliver 3.5 hours of screen on time when I followed the same usage pattern (more or less). That said, after using the device for a week, I was averaging close to four hours of SOT with the phone, and it helps that the handset charges rapidly too. Therefore, as long as you’re not taking the phone on a day-long flight, you should be content with the smartphone’s battery life.    As for software, the Samsung Galaxy S10e boots the company’s One UI on top of Android Pie. And, for the first time, I haven’t missed the near-stock skin on my OnePlus 6T. The UI onboard the S10e is minimalistic and it features some nifty tweaks too, such as the ability to turn on a system-wide dark theme and use customised Edge panels to quickly launch two apps simultaneously in multiwindow mode. Then, there’s the option to customise the device further by choosing from a plethora of themes, icon packs and my favourite bit – setting a personalised edge lighting pattern which glides along the edges of the display to signal oncoming notifications.  Samsung has also introduced gesture-based navigation with its latest UI, which works well for the most part. The software offers users gesture hints, which will tell you where to swipe up to toggle the back, home, and multitasking actions. My only gripe with this navigation system is that whenever I pulled up the multitasking tray, the software automatically shifted to my last used app. Therefore, I had to wait for the animation to render before I could switch between apps, which after a while, started to get on my nerves. Barring that minor inconvenience, Samsung has done a mighty fine job with the One UI for which it deserves a pat on the back. The Samsung Galaxy S10e retails for Rs 55,990 and for the price, it’s not the most inexpensive flagship in the market. It’s clearly not the best performing smartphone either and while the device’s cameras are good, they’re not in the same vein as Google’s Pixel lineup. That said, it’s hard not to recommend the device to buyers who’re tired of using supersized phones. The S10e offers a form factor which is unlike any other in the market. Moreover, besides trimming the size of the flagship, Samsung is offering buyers of the S10e the same flagship experience as they’d get with the bigger S10 or the S10+. Consequently, if you’re in the market for a power-packed flagship which is relatively light on the wallet and considerably light in the pockets, then there’s no better phone than the S10e. If you aren’t bothered by big-screen phones and don’t want to spend a bomb, then you might find better deals from brands like OnePlus and LG. But, they might not have the same charm as owning a top-tier smartphone from Samsung."
2238,30,30894,4.5,5,2018-03-15,,30894,Nitansh Rastogi -,Samsung Galaxy S9+ review: boringly awesome,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review?pid=30894," Making its debut in March 2010, Samsung’s Galaxy S series has been one of the longest-standing flagship ranges in the world of smartphones, surpassed only by Apple’s iPhone series. Nine generations in, the range has continued to push the envelope in terms of what we expect from our smartphones, both in terms of the hardware and features. The latest Galaxy S9 and S9+ (first impressions) are no different. Following the tick-tock approach, this time around, the South Korean giant has refined the S8 and S8+ (review) from the outside, while focussing on camera capabilities and upgraded internals. Of course, like their predecessors, the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ can easily be called the best Android smartphones one can buy, but the real question is what do you get for your money. And that’s what I’m here to dig deeper into today after using the S9+ for about a week.The screen on the Samsung Galaxy S9+ has been rated as the best display ever on a smartphone by DisplayMate, while DxoMark has ranked the device as the best smartphone for capturing stills. One look at the potent spec sheet above, and it’s evident that the brand has left no stone unturned in making its latest offerings the crème de la crème of the phone world. What makes the ‘Plus’ model more exciting is that Samsung has differentiated it well from its smaller sibling, just like the way Apple has been doing with its own iPhones. For the first-time ever, the Galaxy S series gets dual rear cameras, available only on the Galaxy S9+ Both the S9 and the S9+ are available in two storage options of 64GB and 256GB, and the best part is that contrary to rumours which suggested that pricing might be quite high this time, the price tags remains the same as the launch price of last year’s S8 and S8+. The pricing for the Galaxy S9 starts at Rs 57,900, while the base model of the S9+ will set you back by Rs 64,900. So if money is no bar and you simply want the best smartphone available, the Samsung Galaxy S9+ will not disappoint you. If you don’t necessarily want the dual-camera functionality and are looking for a relatively smaller smartphone, then the Galaxy S9 should serve your needs equally well Now if you’re wondering why I think so, then The human eye is an incredibly powerful image capturing tool” – that’s how Samsung started the camera segment of the presentation of its latest flagships at the launch event at MWC, Barcelona. And that’s what has inspired the brand for the camera capabilities of the Galaxy S9 and S9+. Just like how the human eye adapts to different lighting conditions by contracting or expanding the pupils, the cameras on the S9 duo offer a dual aperture of f/1.5 and f/2.4, and can automatically switch between them depending upon the ambient light. In fact, the f/1.5 aperture is the widest-ever on a smartphone yet, making the S9 duo ideal devices for low-light photography. Both the S9 and S9+ come with this feature, but the latter adds dual cameras to the mix. Specs-wise, the Samsung Galaxy S9+ comes equipped with a pair of 12-megapixel snappers, with the primary being a wide-angle sensor and the secondary lens being a telephoto one with f/2.4 aperture. The optically-stabilised sensors offer Live Focus functionality and the ability to zoom up to 2x without losing image quality, similar to the Galaxy Note8 (review). The phone also comes with impressive video-recording capabilities, including a new super slow-mo mode that lets you shoot videos 32 times slower than normal playback speeds.Like always, the camera app on Samsung’s flagship phone is loaded to the gills with modes and options. That’s not to say that the app is difficult to use, as all the options are laid out nicely. When you hold the phone in portrait mode, the large circular button at the bottom acts as the shutter, while the one besides it lets you start shooting videos instantly, and you can also preview your shots. Right above these, you’ll find the camera settings, the ability to use the entire screen as a viewfinder (the resolution is reduced to 7.9MP in this case), the flash toggle, filters and the front camera toggle. You can also use Bixby Vision (which debuted with the S8 duo), and use the 2x optical zoom. Up top, there are a ton of modes such as Live Focus, Pro, Panorama, Food, Super Slow Mo, AR Emoji and Hyperlapse.   In terms of the image quality, the Samsung Galaxy S9+ delivers impressive results. The images are incredibly detailed and vibrant, making them eye-pleasing, be it a landscape or a close-up of a flower. While images look great even otherwise, you can also enable the HDR mode to add more charm. Courtesy dual-pixel autofocus, the camera is quick to focus, making it a joy to shoot with. That said, often times, there’s a bit of a shutter lag. Thanks to the innovative dual aperture technology, the device excels in shooting in dim conditions too, as it offers a sharp output with accurate colours and minimal noise. While you won’t be able to know which aperture was used while shotting in auto mode, the pro mode lets you choose the aperture for shooting. Here’s an example of the difference between the f/1.5 and f/2.4 aperture, without changing any other settings like shutter speed or ISO sensitivity. Even with all these capabilities, the cameras on the S9+ remain a shade behind the Google Pixel 2 XL’s shooters in terms of pure image quality. That said, we’re glad that there are two very impressive cameraphones in the Android segment now. Take a gander at the camera samples taken from the Galaxy S9+. While Samsung might not be the first to incorporate super slow-mo capabilities in a smartphone (Sony introduced it with the Xperia XZs), I’m certainly glad it did. With Motion Detection feature, the S9+’s camera can even trigger Super slow-mo recording automatically whenever it detects motion in a designated area of the frame. While the phone can only capture a 960fps Super slow-mo video for 0.2 seconds, the actual clip turns out to be a six second long, and helps make moments extra-ordinary by adding a different perspective. You can also enhance this further by adding background music or make videos even more interesting as GIFs with options like reverse, loop and swing. However, you need ample lighting to shoot videos in this mode. The regular videos captured by the phone are also impressive in terms of details, colours and smoothness.For selfies, Samsung is continuing with an 8MP f/1.7 shooter at front. However, the S9 duo remains among the very few phones to offer autofocus functionality for the selfie camera. This certainly adds to the quality of the image, which is quite good in daylight or even poorly-lit scenarios, thanks to the screen flash (samples in the gallery above). And if you want to spruce up your selfies, there’s the new AR Emoji. Not much different from Apple’s Animojis (at least in terms of the idea, if not the tech and execution), the feature lets you create a virtual 3D avatar of yourself that tracks your facial movements. However, unlike Apple’s TrueDepth camera system, the Chaebol is only utilising the front camera and machine learning (to map out more than 100 facial features) to enable this functionality. The device even lets you customise your AR Emoji and also creates some GIFs once the avatar is made. While initially, these avatars are fun to create and you can share them via WhatsApp, etc., they seem gimmicky once the novelty factor wears off.
    When the S9/S9+ are kept next to their predecessors, you could find it tough to tell them apart. Not that it’s a bad thing, as Samsung has popularised the glass-based design with metallic reinforcement along the edges. Add to it the Infinity Display up front which curves towards the sides, and the Samsung Galaxy S9+ is a stunning smartphone. Another factor distinguishing the device from the crowd is its Coral Blue and Lilac Purple hues along with the regular black or grey options. On noticing closely however, the S9 duo feature even slimmer bezels at the top and bottom as compared to their previous avatars. With the display panel turned off, the smartphone seems to have a full-screen front as it seamlessly blends with the bezels which cleverly hide the sensors, and only the earpiece and the front-facing camera is visible up top. The placement of ports and controls remains the same and thankfully, that means there’s a 3.5mm socket at the base. Sadly, the device retains a dedicated button to launch the Bixby smart assistant, and the key can’t be mapped to anything else. Thankfully, Samsung has addressed the biggest gripe we had with its last year’s flagships – the positioning of the fingerprint scanner. On the Samsung Galaxy S9+, the scanner is now conveniently located beneath the camera module, making it easier to reach along with ensuring that the sensors don’t get smudged. The camera module is accompanied by the LED flash and a heart-rate sensors scan is used to unlock the smartphone, since it can work with less light. However, the downside is that intelligent scan isn’t as fast as facial unlock on many smartphones.  The rear panel of the Galaxy S9+ is a shiny slab of glass, which looks really eye-pleasing with its light-reflecting characteristics, but gathers fingerprints and smudges. The good thing however, is that even though it’s smooth, the phone doesn’t feel slippery even after long sessions of usage. Samsung is also thoughtfully bundling a soft transparent case to protect it. I used the handset without the case for a couple of days to get the in-hand feel and the glass didn’t get scratched. However, using a case is advisable to make sure the sheen can stay for long periods.  While the Samsung Galaxy S9+ is marginally thicker than its predecessor – 8.5mm vs 8.1mm, it doesn’t seem that way, thanks to curved edges at the front and back. In fact, the device also weighs more at 185g versus 173g of the S8+, and yet doesn’t feel heavy as the weight has been distributed well across the body. Ergonomically, the smartphone offers a good in-hand feel and it can even be operated single-handedly, provided one has large hands. Unlike previous smartphones with curved edges from the Korean brand, the display sloping towards the edges is much more refined and thus, reduces the chance of inadvertent touches. The Corning Gorilla Glass 5-protected display continues to offer QHD+ resolution. And while I couldn’t have thought this was possible, the Samsung Galaxy S9+’s 6.2-inch Super AMOLED panel looks even better than its previous iteration. It’s sharp, bright and vibrant, and can easily be seen under harsh sunlight. The display is also certified for Mobile HDR Premium, allowing it to offer more contrast while watching compatible videos. The always-on display feature also gets an update as there are quite a few templates to show date and time, and you can utilise just the edge screen for the same if you want.  Of course, the Galaxy S9+ continues with the dust- and water-proofing feature, all thanks to IP68 protection. The device can survive in 1.5m deep water for up to 30 minutes. Like always, Samsung’s newest flagship comes equipped with the latest and greatest. The Galaxy S9+ is powered by a 10nm Exynos 9810 processor. The SoC is clocked at 2.8GHz for the four high-end cores, while the remaining four power-efficient scores are tuned at 1.7GHz. Combined with a Mali-T880 graphics engine and 6GB of RAM, the phone is a true powerhouse. From basic tasks of switching between apps to running heavy ones, or even playing graphics-intensive games, the smartphone performs like a hot knife on butter. The thermals are also managed well. Even after an hour of playing Middle-earth: Shadow of War or CSR Racing 2, the handset doesn’t heat up. The same remains the case even while using GPS, though the phone does get slightly warm while charging, which is quite normal anyway.  Even though the performance is a delight, some lag does creep in here and there on the Samsung Galaxy S9+. While scrolling the multitasking menu or swiping left to access the Bixby screen for example, you’ll find traces of jitter creeping in. That said, the software is quite refined and hasn’t crashed on me yet. Talking about software, the Galaxy S9+ boots the latest Android 8.0 Oreo layered with the custom Samsung Experience 9.0 layer atop. As such, it’s not much different from previous iterations of the skin. The custom interface and icons can be themed the way you want. While Samsung has definitely reduced the laundry-list of features it used to offer with its software, it still continues with duplicate apps (from both Samsung and Google – two browsers, two app stores, etc.) and there are preinstalled titles from Microsoft as well.    Having said that, I liked the fact that I can access the pair of apps that were previously opened in split-screen mode directly in the multitasking menu. Speaking of which, the S9+ gets the App Pair mode from the Galaxy Note8, allowing you to automatically set two apps to open simultaneously using a single tap from the Apps Edge. Another small-but-useful feature is that when you’re using the multitasking mode in landscape orientation, then the homescreen and app menu rotate accordingly.  Bixby has also got some updates on the S9+. And while it’s no Google Assistant, it does come in handy in quite a few scenarios. For Bixby Vision, the camera now comes with nine preset modes, letting you translate text, scan a QR code or get the calorie information for the food in front. All of these are useful, since normally, you’d need separate apps for similar functionality.   On the storage side of things, the Samsung Galaxy S9+ ships with 64GB of memory (there’s a 256GB storage variant as well). End users will get around 50.5GB for their personal use, and if that’s not enough, one can always slide in a microSD card of up to 400GB to add more.  Fuelling the Samsung Galaxy S9+ is a 3,500mAh battery, which is the same capacity as its predecessor. It ensures that the device can comfortably last an entire working day, but if you’re a heavy user, it’d require juicing up by night. With my usage of streaming music via Bluetooth, watching YouTube videos for an hour, using 4G for messaging on WhatsApp and browsing, and of course, a few calls, the device had less than 10 percent left by the end of the day. On an average, the phone is able to offer about four hours of screen-on time. This is when the screen was pushing 1,080 x 2,160 pixels and wasn’t set at QHD+ resolution. In our video loop test however, it gave impressive results as it drained just 10 percent in an hour of HD video playback with both brightness and volume levels at 50 percent.   You can, of course, use the battery saving modes to prolong usage time as and when required. With the bundled charger, the S9+ can be juiced up from 10 to 100 percent in about 90 minutes. The phone also supports fast charging with the optional wireless charger. Complementing the immersive display for multimedia lovers are stereo speakers tuned by AKG. While one speaker is placed at the bottom, the earpiece doubles up as another, offering loud sound output. The audio is also much richer thanks to Dolby support.  The Samsung Galaxy S9+ comes with a full suite of connectivity options, ranging from dual-SIM support (the secondary slot is hybrid) to Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC and GPS. It supports 4G VoLTE with Carrier Aggregation (CA) to offer faster data speeds, and thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, it can also stream music to two devices at the same time. Is the Samsung Galaxy S9+ perfect? No Is it the best Android smartphone one can buy? Without a doubt. It’s a great all-rounder that impresses in almost every aspect and doesn’t miss out on anything crucial feature either. If you’re in the market for a flagship smartphone, then you should know that the Galaxy S9+ is more affordable than the iPhone X (review), which costs nearly a lakh for the base model. While the iPhone X will certainly make more sense for those who are invested heavily in the Apple ecosystem and/or want a no-fuss smartphone, the S9+ surely gets my recommendation for its price and features like Dual Aperture and Super slow-mo video recording. Another strong contender in the Android category is the Google Pixel 2 XL (review), which is still slightly better in terms of the camera capabilities, and also the software (as it comes with stock Android and promises regular updates). However, if you’re looking for an all-rounder smartphone that won’t leave you wanting for more, then the Samsung Galaxy S9+ is a better choice.         Photos by Raj Rout"

While images look great even otherwise, you can also enable the HDR mode to add more charm. Courtesy dual-pixel autofocus, the camera is quick to focus, making it a joy to shoot with. That said, often times, there’s a bit of a shutter lag. Thanks to the innovative dual aperture technology, the device excels in shooting in dim conditions too, as it offers a sharp output with accurate colours and minimal noise. While you won’t be able to know which aperture was used while shotting in auto mode, the pro mode lets you choose the aperture for shooting. Here’s an example of the difference between the f/1.5 and f/2.4 aperture, without changing any other settings like shutter speed or ISO sensitivity. Even with all these capabilities, the cameras on the S9+ remain a shade behind the Google Pixel 2 XL’s shooters in terms of pure image quality. That said, we’re glad that there are two very impressive cameraphones in the Android segment now. Take a gander at the camera samples taken from the Galaxy S9+. While Samsung might not be the first to incorporate super slow-mo capabilities in a smartphone (Sony introduced it with the Xperia XZs), I’m certainly glad it did. With Motion Detection feature, the S9+’s camera can even trigger Super slow-mo recording automatically whenever it detects motion in a designated area of the frame. While the phone can only capture a 960fps Super slow-mo video for 0.2 seconds, the actual clip turns out to be a six second long, and helps make moments extra-ordinary by adding a different perspective. You can also enhance this further by adding background music or make videos even more interesting as GIFs with options like reverse, loop and swing. However, you need ample lighting to shoot videos in this mode. The regular videos captured by the phone are also impressive in terms of details, colours and smoothness.For selfies, Samsung is continuing with an 8MP f/1.7 shooter at front. However, the S9 duo remains among the very few phones to offer autofocus functionality for the selfie camera. This certainly adds to the quality of the image, which is quite good in daylight or even poorly-lit scenarios, thanks to the screen flash (samples in the gallery above). And if you want to spruce up your selfies, there’s the new AR Emoji. Not much different from Apple’s Animojis (at least in terms of the idea, if not the tech and execution), the feature lets you create a virtual 3D avatar of yourself that tracks your facial movements. However, unlike Apple’s TrueDepth camera system, the Chaebol is only utilising the front camera and machine learning (to map out more than 100 facial features) to enable this functionality. The device even lets you customise your AR Emoji and also creates some GIFs once the avatar is made. While initially, these avatars are fun to create and you can share them via WhatsApp, etc., they seem gimmicky once the novelty factor wears off.
    When the S9/S9+ are kept next to their predecessors, you could find it tough to tell them apart. Not that it’s a bad thing, as Samsung has popularised the glass-based design with metallic reinforcement along the edges. Add to it the Infinity Display up front which curves towards the sides, and the Samsung Galaxy S9+ is a stunning smartphone. Another factor distinguishing the device from the crowd is its Coral Blue and Lilac Purple hues along with the regular black or grey options. On noticing closely however, the S9 duo feature even slimmer bezels at the top and bottom as compared to their previous avatars. With the display panel turned off, the smartphone seems to have a full-screen front as it seamlessly blends with the bezels which cleverly hide the sensors, and only the earpiece and the front-facing camera is visible up top. The placement of ports and controls remains the same and thankfully, that means there’s a 3.5mm socket at the base. Sadly, the device retains a dedicated button to launch the Bixby smart assistant, and the key can’t be mapped to anything else. Thankfully, Samsung has addressed the biggest gripe we had with its last year’s flagships – the positioning of the fingerprint scanner. On the Samsung Galaxy S9+, the scanner is now conveniently located beneath the camera module, making it easier to reach along with ensuring that the sensors don’t get smudged. The camera module is accompanied by the LED flash and a heart-rate sensors scan is used to unlock the smartphone, since it can work with less light. However, the downside is that intelligent scan isn’t as fast as facial unlock on many smartphones.  The rear panel of the Galaxy S9+ is a shiny slab of glass, which looks really eye-pleasing with its light-reflecting characteristics, but gathers fingerprints and smudges. The good thing however, is that even though it’s smooth, the phone doesn’t feel slippery even after long sessions of usage. Samsung is also thoughtfully bundling a soft transparent case to protect it. I used the handset without the case for a couple of days to get the in-hand feel and the glass didn’t get scratched. However, using a case is advisable to make sure the sheen can stay for long periods.  While the Samsung Galaxy S9+ is marginally thicker than its predecessor – 8.5mm vs 8.1mm, it doesn’t seem that way, thanks to curved edges at the front and back. In fact, the device also weighs more at 185g versus 173g of the S8+, and yet doesn’t feel heavy as the weight has been distributed well across the body. Ergonomically, the smartphone offers a good in-hand feel and it can even be operated single-handedly, provided one has large hands. Unlike previous smartphones with curved edges from the Korean brand, the display sloping towards the edges is much more refined and thus, reduces the chance of inadvertent touches. The Corning Gorilla Glass 5-protected display continues to offer QHD+ resolution. And while I couldn’t have thought this was possible, the Samsung Galaxy S9+’s 6.2-inch Super AMOLED panel looks even better than its previous iteration. It’s sharp, bright and vibrant, and can easily be seen under harsh sunlight. The display is also certified for Mobile HDR Premium, allowing it to offer more contrast while watching compatible videos. The always-on display feature also gets an update as there are quite a few templates to show date and time, and you can utilise just the edge screen for the same if you want.  Of course, the Galaxy S9+ continues with the dust- and water-proofing feature, all thanks to IP68 protection. The device can survive in 1.5m deep water for up to 30 minutes. Like always, Samsung’s newest flagship comes equipped with the latest and greatest. The Galaxy S9+ is powered by a 10nm Exynos 9810 processor. The SoC is clocked at 2.8GHz for the four high-end cores, while the remaining four power-efficient scores are tuned at 1.7GHz. Combined with a Mali-T880 graphics engine and 6GB of RAM, the phone is a true powerhouse. From basic tasks of switching between apps to running heavy ones, or even playing graphics-intensive games, the smartphone performs like a hot knife on butter. The thermals are also managed well. Even after an hour of playing Middle-earth: Shadow of War or CSR Racing 2, the handset doesn’t heat up. The same remains the case even while using GPS, though the phone does get slightly warm while charging, which is quite normal anyway.  Even though the performance is a delight, some lag does creep in here and there on the Samsung Galaxy S9+. While scrolling the multitasking menu or swiping left to access the Bixby screen for example, you’ll find traces of jitter creeping in. That said, the software is quite refined and hasn’t crashed on me yet. Talking about software, the Galaxy S9+ boots the latest Android 8.0 Oreo layered with the custom Samsung Experience 9.0 layer atop. As such, it’s not much different from previous iterations of the skin. The custom interface and icons can be themed the way you want. While Samsung has definitely reduced the laundry-list of features it used to offer with its software, it still continues with duplicate apps (from both Samsung and Google – two browsers, two app stores, etc.) and there are preinstalled titles from Microsoft as well.    Having said that, I liked the fact that I can access the pair of apps that were previously opened in split-screen mode directly in the multitasking menu. Speaking of which, the S9+ gets the App Pair mode from the Galaxy Note8, allowing you to automatically set two apps to open simultaneously using a single tap from the Apps Edge. Another small-but-useful feature is that when you’re using the multitasking mode in landscape orientation, then the homescreen and app menu rotate accordingly.  Bixby has also got some updates on the S9+. And while it’s no Google Assistant, it does come in handy in quite a few scenarios. For Bixby Vision, the camera now comes with nine preset modes, letting you translate text, scan a QR code or get the calorie information for the food in front. All of these are useful, since normally, you’d need separate apps for similar functionality.   On the storage side of things, the Samsung Galaxy S9+ ships with 64GB of memory (there’s a 256GB storage variant as well). End users will get around 50.5GB for their personal use, and if that’s not enough, one can always slide in a microSD card of up to 400GB to add more.  Fuelling the Samsung Galaxy S9+ is a 3,500mAh battery, which is the same capacity as its predecessor. It ensures that the device can comfortably last an entire working day, but if you’re a heavy user, it’d require juicing up by night. With my usage of streaming music via Bluetooth, watching YouTube videos for an hour, using 4G for messaging on WhatsApp and browsing, and of course, a few calls, the device had less than 10 percent left by the end of the day. On an average, the phone is able to offer about four hours of screen-on time. This is when the screen was pushing 1,080 x 2,160 pixels and wasn’t set at QHD+ resolution. In our video loop test however, it gave impressive results as it drained just 10 percent in an hour of HD video playback with both brightness and volume levels at 50 percent.   You can, of course, use the battery saving modes to prolong usage time as and when required. With the bundled charger, the S9+ can be juiced up from 10 to 100 percent in about 90 minutes. The phone also supports fast charging with the optional wireless charger. Complementing the immersive display for multimedia lovers are stereo speakers tuned by AKG. While one speaker is placed at the bottom, the earpiece doubles up as another, offering loud sound output. The audio is also much richer thanks to Dolby support.  The Samsung Galaxy S9+ comes with a full suite of connectivity options, ranging from dual-SIM support (the secondary slot is hybrid) to Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, NFC and GPS. It supports 4G VoLTE with Carrier Aggregation (CA) to offer faster data speeds, and thanks to Bluetooth 5.0, it can also stream music to two devices at the same time. Is the Samsung Galaxy S9+ perfect? No Is it the best Android smartphone one can buy? Without a doubt. It’s a great all-rounder that impresses in almost every aspect and doesn’t miss out on anything crucial feature either. If you’re in the market for a flagship smartphone, then you should know that the Galaxy S9+ is more affordable than the iPhone X (review), which costs nearly a lakh for the base model. While the iPhone X will certainly make more sense for those who are invested heavily in the Apple ecosystem and/or want a no-fuss smartphone, the S9+ surely gets my recommendation for its price and features like Dual Aperture and Super slow-mo video recording. Another strong contender in the Android category is the Google Pixel 2 XL (review), which is still slightly better in terms of the camera capabilities, and also the software (as it comes with stock Android and promises regular updates). However, if you’re looking for an all-rounder smartphone that won’t leave you wanting for more, then the Samsung Galaxy S9+ is a better choice.         Photos by Raj Rout"
2268,30,32615,4,5,2018-07-19,,32615,Prateek Pandey -,Vivo NEX review: ahead of the curve in more ways than one,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/vivo-nex-review?pid=32615," “Our two cents on the futuristic Vivo NEX Raise your hand if you’ve grown up watching sci-fi movies like Minority Report, where smartphones were made up of nothing more than a thin sheen of glass. Well, I’m here to tell you that the smartphone from the future is here, and it hasn’t been manufactured by the Apples of the world. Instead, the device I’m referring to has been constructed by Vivo, a company better known for its selfie-centric offerings. The smartphone in question is the Vivo NEX, and the device is packed to the brim with a variety of next-gen features and top-notch specs.  It goes without saying that Vivo’s NEX is a monumental leap in smartphone innovation. But, the NEX is understandably not without its flaws.  The fact that the Vivo NEX is a truly bezel-less smartphone, and yet doesn’t ship with a notch is a feat in itself. Unlike most other manufacturers, the company’s decision to innovate, not ape has resulted in one of the best-looking flagships you’ll possibly see this year. You could spin the NEX any way you want, look at it from the top or the bottom, the smartphone just looks gorgeous from all angles. That being said, the most captivating bit of the smartphone’s design is arguably it’s 6.59-inch display, which makes up over 91-percent of the smartphone’s front. For comparison, here’s a picture of the Vivo NEX with the Apple iPhone X (review) and the OnePlus 6 (review).  Right off the bat, you’ll notice that unlike other flagships, the display on the Vivo NEX isn’t marred by the presence of a fingerprint sensor, a notch or even a secondary camera module. To do so, Vivo had to go back to the drawing board and after what I can only guess as months of experimenting, the company unveiled the Apex Concept at MWC this year. The NEX builds upon the same principles which made the Apex Concept the talk of the town and ships with an under-the-display fingerprint sensor, a pop-out selfie camera, and a piezoelectric speaker. Let’s address each of these features individually.Vivo has been working on an under-the-display fingerprint sensor for quite some time now. The brand initially partnered with Qualcomm last year to bring this tech to the masses. However, somewhere down the line, the deal fell through and Vivo instead partnered with Synaptics and used the company’s optical sensor on its X21 smartphone. History lesson aside, the fingerprint sensor onboard the Vivo NEX is a lot more polished than what we saw on its predecessor, the X21. For the unit to work, the sensor sees through the gaps between the pixels on the NEX’s AMOLED panel and captures a reflection of the user’s fingerprint. The sensor does take some time getting used to, and even though Vivo has made some improvements to it, it’s still not as quick or accurate as a physical fingerprint sensor. That being said, I’ll take the occasional delay in favour of a truly bezel-less display any day There’s no mistaking it – the NEX is a beautiful flagship, but after you’ve spent some time with it, the smartphone will seem like most other premium devices in the market. I’ve been using the handset for over a week and although I still admire its sleek bezels, they don’t wow me anymore. However, the novelty of opening the smartphone’s front camera still hasn’t worn off, and it’s what makes the NEX ‘cool’. So, every time you open the camera app and switch to the front camera, the secondary shooter will pop out from inside the smartphone’s chassis. You can also choose from three different sound presets to add a dramatic effect whenever the selfie camera is opening or retracting back inside the phone.Although the pop-out selfie camera is quite cool, it does come with some caveats. There’s the obvious concern about the module’s longevity, since it is using mechanical parts which could wear out after some time. Now, Vivo does have some measures set in place to avoid such a scenario and you’ll get a warning if you open the front camera frequently. Moreover, should the camera app fail or crash and the selfie camera is stuck, you can push it back inside with a little bit of force. The company even claims that the external housing for the selfie camera has been constructed using stainless steel and that the unit can be ‘lifted’ 50,000 times without failing. Everything considered, only time will tell how well-oiled the mechanical parts inside the Vivo NEX are, but it’s always going to play at the back of someone’s mind who clicks a lot of selfies.  Lastly, the Vivo NEX doesn’t ship with a traditional earpiece and instead, uses the screen of the smartphone to project sound. Vivo calls this technology ‘sound casting’ and it does work, though the in-call volumes were a bit too low for my liking and I had to ask the person on the other end to repeat what they’d said on several occasions. The back of the Vivo NEX is stunning too, mind you. The smartphone sports a glass-back design which features a matrix pattern that shimmers and exhibits different shades of a rainbow when light strikes it at an angle. Suffice it to say, you’ll attract a few eyeballs whenever you take the smartphone out of your pockets on a bright sunny dayDespite its sleek bezels, the Vivo NEX is still a big smartphone which coupled with its slippery glass back, make it a nightmare to use with just one hand. Moreover, the smartphone is a lot more delicate compared to other offerings owing to the presence of motorised components as well as the lack of any IP certification. Therefore, I’d recommend you keep the smartphone wrapped in a case if you want to avoid frequent trips to the service centre.  The NEX’s massive 6.59-inch FHD+ display is an eye-candy and the panel flaunts wide viewing angles. Moreover, since the tech backing the smartphone’s display is Super AMOLED, you’ll get all the usual benefits associated with it, including deep blacks, good contrast and vivid colours. What’s more, there’s little-to-no backlit bleeding either and the panel gets plenty bright under direct sunlight too. Lastly, I must admit, the NEX is the first smartphone which has compelled me to use Android’s split-screen mode. You’ll get plenty of screen real-estate with the smartphone which is spacious enough to fit two apps on the same pane comfortably. Unfortunately, only a handful of applications can be opened in split-screen mode at the moment, so you can’t Netflix and WhatsApp on the NEX at the same time. Cool quotient aside, how good is the pop-out selfie camera on the NEX? Well, Vivo knows a thing or two about selfies, considering how the brand has a range of selfie-centric smartphones available in India. Spec-wise, it’s an 8MP unit with f/2.0 aperture which clicks really good selfies, when there’s ample light around. That said, I did notice that the shooter softens the skin tones and removes blemishes even when you’re not clicking pictures in beauty mode. I didn’t have any problems with that since the end result was quite appealing. However, if you like to click authentic, true to life selfies, then you might have to look elsewhere.  Moving on, the performance of the selfie shooter in low light is admirable too and although the NEX lacks a dedicated LED flash module for the front shooter, the smartphone makes up for it by offering screen lighting. You’ll also get some neat parlour tricks with the NEX’s selfie camera too, such as the ability to take portraits with studio lighting effects and so on. Interestingly, choosing a lighting effect also adds an artificial bokeh to the images. For those wondering, the cut-out doesn’t seem unnatural, however you will notice some soft edges along the borders of your selfie. All in all, the selfie-shooter on the Vivo NEX is excellent, but do bear in mind that unlike other smartphones, the pop-out shooter is a clear tell whenever you’re clicking selfies, especially if you’ve got the sound effects enabled. It might not be a deal-breaker for some, but rest assured, you will get some looks every now and then if you’re taking pictures with the NEX in public places.  The primary camera setup of the NEX comprises dual 12MP and 5MP shooters with f/1.8 and f/2.4 aperture respectively. The main shooter makes use of a Sony IMX363 sensor and also comes with 4-axis OIS, which should come in handy when you’re shooting videos. As far as the image quality is concerned, it’s right up there with the best of the best and the smartphone manages to take crisp photos with rich colours in broad daylight. The dynamic range is outstanding too and the built-in HDR mode adds just the right amount of contrast to the images without making them too saturated. Along the same lines, the portrait mode does well to differentiate between the subject and the background too, resulting in attractive pictures with a nice, blurry background.             That said, what impressed me the most is the camera’s performance in lowlight scenarios. Without a shadow of doubt, the NEX is among the top three smartphones when it comes to clicking pictures in dimly lit environments and the device manages to squeeze out colours from dark areas quite comfortably. You will notice a considerable amount of noise in the images, but that’s the case with all smartphone cameras.  Talking about the camera interface, the NEX’s camera app is nothing out of the ordinary. You can swipe left or right to switch between different modes and access the camera settings by clicking the cog wheel located towards the top right, above the viewfinder. As is the case with most other flagships, the NEX too comes bundled with AI smarts using which, the smartphone can automatically detect the scene. While it’s up for debate how much AI processing (if any at all) actually goes into shooting the images, the end result is what matters and the smartphone unquestionably delivers on that front. At the end of the day, the NEX is a smartphone and a flagship at that. So, if you were curious about the specs, you’ll get the usual array of a Snapdragon 845 processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of built-in, non-expandable storage with the device. Unsurprisingly, the NEX performs like a champ and opens applications or games in the blink of an eye. Graphically demanding titles like PUBG and Asphalt 8 ran without any jitters and the device managed to retain over a dozen apps in memory, making multitasking on the smartphone all that better. Moreover, thanks to its ginormous display, gaming on the smartphone is an enjoyable experience too, as your fingers don’t have to struggle for space.  I was greatly impressed with how well the smartphone handled thermals too and even after hours of continuous gaming, the NEX’s chassis stayed cool to the touch. On the software side of things, the Vivo NEX boots Android Oreo with a skin of the company’s proprietary FunTouch OS on top. It’s a far cry from stock Android, but the skin does come bundled with some really nice features. For starters, I absolutely loved using gesture-based navigation on the smartphone, as the controls were intuitive and responded well to the touch. Moreover, since the smartphone is a bit clunky to use with just one hand, you can easily enable the one-handed mode by swiping inwards from the edge of the display and retracing the move back to the edge of the panel.  As is the case with most other Chinese skins, you’ll be able to customise the UI on the NEX to your liking by choosing from a plethora of themes available with the iTheme app. Everything considered, FunTouch OS has some neat features, but at the end of the day, you’ll either love using it, or you’ll install a custom launcher to make the experience more stock-like.  Now, the NEX wouldn’t be a 2018 flagship if it didn’t ship with AI. With that in mind, the smartphone comes with a solitary button on the left fascia, tapping which brings up the Google Lens. You can long-press the button to invoke the Google Assistant too, though much like what Samsung has done with its recent flagships, Vivo doesn’t let you reprogram the key to open a different application. That being said, you at least get the option to turn off the Google Lens functionality from within the settings. The NEX is among the rare breed of flagships which still ship with a headphone jack. Besides having the convenience of plugging in any 3.5mm headphones you might have lying around, the audio output from the Vivo NEX is excellent, thanks in no small part to the built-in V1 Hi-Fi DAC. Paired with the right set of headphones, the NEX makes a strong case against carrying a DAP with your smartphone at the same time.  Unfortunately, the mono speaker located at the bottom of the smartphone is not going to replace a dedicated Bluetooth speaker, even a cheap one at that. It gets sufficiently loud, however, there’s noticeably less richness in the sound output as compared to say, the iPhone X or the Galaxy S9+.   In the battery department, the NEX’s 4,000mAh pack comfortably saw me through the end of a heavy day which involved a lot of messaging, browsing my social media feeds, clicking a ton of selfies, listening to songs on Apple Music and some Netflix. The smartphone charges rapidly too, thanks to the addition of a 22W brick which takes about ten minutes to give the handset a six percent charge. The Vivo NEX easily takes the cake for the most exciting smartphone I’ve reviewed in a while. The device is a glimpse into the future and is a testament to the fact that smartphone innovation has in fact not gone down the drain. What’s more, the NEX scores big in three key areas and is equipped with great cameras, offers rapid fast performance and a day-long battery life too.  Consequently, the NEX is the most expensive smartphone to come out of Vivo’s stables and has been priced at (justifiably, if I may add)  Rs 44,990. But, for all its innovations, the NEX is not without flaws and one cannot overlook the fact that the smartphone is a delicate darling, as it features motorised components and doesn’t ship with any sort of IP certification. Furthermore, the NEX doesn’t come with features like wireless charging, has a relatively slower fingerprint sensor as compared to other flagships and is poor at relaying calls clearly too. These may or may not be deal breakers for you depending upon your usage, but if you’re willing to live with these trade-offs, the NEX comes across as a flagship worth taking a second look at.  That’s not to say that it doesn’t face any competition, especially if you don’t mind the notch. You could save a bunch on the OnePlus 6 or even the recently-launched ASUS ZenFone 5Z (review), both of which offer similar performance, and feature stunning glass-sandwich designs… though lose out on the imaging front. If pricing isn’t the determining factor for your purchase, then there are other premium flagships as well, including the Samsung Galaxy S9+ (review) and the Huawei P20 Pro (review). Lest I forget, the recently-launched OPPO Find X (first impressions) also comes with a sliding-camera mechanism to deliver a truly bezel-less experience albeit commands a premium worth Rs 59,990.   Everything considered, the NEX is a sign of the changing times, and we can’t wait to see how other manufacturers will take Vivo’s approach forward. "
2394,30,32657,4,5,2018-09-06,,32657,Ketaki Bhojnagarwala -,Vivo V11 Pro review: a capable mid-ranger packed with flagship extras,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/vivo-v11-pro-review?pid=32657," Technology can go from cutting edge to mainstream in the blink of an eye, and there’s no better example of this than our smartphones. Features like face unlock, pop-up cameras and all-screen displays – initially relegated to flagships and concepts – now make an appearance even on affordable devices. Vivo, which pioneered the in-display fingerprint sensor with the X21 (review) and carried it forward with the NEX (review), is now bringing this tech to the mid-range with the V11 Pro. Packing in some solid specs and goodies like a water drop notch, face unlock and a 25MP AI selfie camera, the V11 Pro is quite the package. I’ve used the phone for over a week, and here’s what you need to know about the device.With so many smartphones looking like they came off an iPhone X production line, it’s unusual to find a device that can hold its own on the design front. The Vivo V11 Pro has no problems in this department. From the fullscreen display to the illuminated in-display fingerprint scanner to the ombre back panel – it’s crafted to make heads turn. The V11 Pro is available in Gold and Starry Night colour options, but the latter is what I’d choose any day. The panel is a gradiented midnight blue, and the subtle sparkle makes for a realistic starry effect. I was pleasantly surprised to find two SIM card slots and a dedicated microSD card slot on the device. Disappointingly, Vivo has chosen to go with the older micro-USB standard for the V11 Pro, but the good news is that the company doesn’t skimp on a 3.5mm audio jack. The V11 Pro is a big phone, with a 6.41-inch display that can make one-handed usage next to impossible. Vivo’s cut down on the bezels significantly, with just a thin sliver at the chin. The water drop notch at the top is far less noticeable than traditional notches, and displays the status bar on either side, along with select notification icons. The notch blends seamlessly into Vivo’s own apps, but third-party apps aren’t optimised for it, so you have a coloured bar at the top that cuts off some of some screen real estate. On most apps, the colour of the bar matches (or at least tries to match) the colour scheme of the respective app, so it doesn’t appear too obtrusive. The Super AMOLED 19:9 screen features full HD+ resolution, and displays rich, saturated colours. The OLED panel is what enables the fingerprint sensor to work, and illuminates the sensor as soon as you pick it up. The V11 Pro also has an always-on display feature, which displays the time, date and select notification icons. You can enable this in settings.  The fingerprint sensor is set up the conventional way, and you can choose from a series of effects that appear when you unlock the phone. A fingerprint sensor that sits right in the display feels like a page out of the future, but in real life I found the experience to be less than satisfactory. You need to apply pressure to unlock the phone, but you can’t press too lightly or too hard – it has to be just right, and for some reason I couldn’t get it right on several occasions. Because the fingerprint sensor is located on the screen, you need to make sure your finger is positioned correctly – the phone never unlocked if I tried with the tip or sides of my finger. Add to that the slight delay it takes for the screen to unlock, and I found myself wishing Vivo had opted for a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor instead. The good news though is that the Vivo V11 Pro also comes with face unlock, which I can vouch works seamlessly. It’s instantaneous, and works at an angle, in the dark or even if you’re wearing sunglasses.The V11 Pro carries forward the AI selfie camera of its predecessor, the V9 (review). The camera takes stunning selfies and can make anyone look good – and I say that as a sleep-deprived mom of a six-month old. Even though I turned the beauty mode off, it’s obvious that Vivo is applying some beautification effects, because I couldn’t see my dark circles in any of the photos I snapped. The camera also features a Portrait mode, which creates a bokeh effect with a blurred background. You can choose from various lighting effects like Natural, Studio, Stereo, Monochrome, etc while using Portrait mode. The rear camera consists of a 12MP f/1.8 unit paired with a 5MP depth sensor in a vertical setup. Both the front and rear cameras feature Vivo’s AI tech, which automatically recognises the scene and enables a suitable shooting mode. The rear camera produces sharp and detailed images in daylight, especially for close-ups. The backlit HDR mode works well for the most part, but tends to create artificial results in harsh lighting. In low light, images look washed out and grainy. The portrait mode on the rear camera works well, although I noticed visible softening around the edges. The bottomline is that the cameras aren’t for purists, but for the average user who wants an Instagram-worthy shot, you’ll be more than satisfied with what the Vivo V11 Pro offers.  On the software side of things you get Vivo’s FunTouch OS 4.5 atop Android 8.1 Oreo. While I’m not the biggest fan of FunTouch, it offers some useful features like gestures for navigation, split-screen mode and one-handed mode. The split-screen mode was particularly useful, displaying a floating icon for notifications from apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and messages. Tapping on the icon while you’re using another app opens the respective app in split-screen mode. It works seamlessly and is a great way to multi-task too.   Powering the V11 Pro is a Snapdragon 660 SoC, paired with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Out of the box, my unit had about 52GB of free space. You can bump up the storage via microSD, and also connect a flash drive via USB OTG. The smartphone fares well in day-to-day performance, and I didn’t notice any app crashes or freezes during my usage, even with multiple apps running in the background. The V11 Pro handled gaming well enough, but I did notice a few jitters and frame drops during PUBG gameplay. The 3,400mAh battery on the device offers ample juice to get you through an entire day. In my personal usage, the phone lasted me a day and a half on most occasions. In our battery drain test, the V11 Pro lasted a total of 14.5 hours.  As far as mid-range smartphones go, the Vivo V11 Pro is a well-rounded offering. Honestly speaking, my only gripe with the phone was the glitchy fingerprint sensor, and even that’s offset by the presence of face unlock. The competition for the V11 Pro includes devices like the OPPO F9 Pro (first impressions) and the Nokia 7 Plus (review), which offer similar features in the same price band. The POCO F1 (review) though, is the one Vivo should be worried about. Packing in flagship specs like a Snapdragon 845 SoC and 6GB of RAM at a starting price of Rs 20,999, it pretty much decimates the competition. That said, the POCO F1, like any new Xiaomi device, isn’t easily available, and that’s where the V11 Pro has a distinct advantage. Which one you ultimately choose is up to you, but either way, you won’t be disappointed.    Photos by Raj Rout"
2261,30,32277,3.5,5,2018-03-23,,32277,Prateek Pandey -,Vivo V9 review: the stunning display and awesome selfies take it a notch above,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/vivo-v9-review?pid=32277," “The Vivo V9 offers a gorgeous display and impressive specsSmartphones with bezel-less designs are here to stay, though manufacturers still need to engineer a way to relocate the selfie camera and other sensors for a truly bezel-less appearance. So far, the closest we’ve come to a truly bezel-less smartphone has been the Apex concept phone demoed by Chinese tech giant Vivo at its MWC press conference this year. However, it still might be a while until the Apex concept phone sees light of day. A more mainstream approach we’ve seen in this department is by the Cupertino giant Apple and its iPhone X (review). The company has managed to make all but the top of the smartphone bezel-less and has housed all the necessary sensors and components inside a notch at the very top. Nowadays, more and more Android manufacturers are following Apple’s footsteps and the most recent smartphone to ship with a notch is the Vivo V9. In fact, the Vivo V9 is the first notch-toting Android phone to land in India. So, is the device yet another affordable iPhone X clone or is there more to it than meets the eye? Let’s find out in this review of the Vivo V9.  There’s no denying the fact that the V9’s design is heavily influenced by the iPhone X. However, once you look past that, you’ll have what is essentially a well built and a rather good-looking smartphone. As far as the materials used in the construction are concerned, the V9 is fashioned out of plastic, and the back of the device features a glossy finish, which is a treat to look at. The experience doesn’t last all that long though since the back of the smartphone is a fingerprint magnet and smudges really easily. I’d also like to mention that the device is a tad bit slippery, but thanks to Vivo’s excellent weight distribution, the V9 doesn’t feel unwieldy in the hand. On the contrary, the smartphone offers excellent ergonomics and one-handed usability which is a rarity, considering the smartphone’s rather large display. Speaking of which, the Vivo V9 ships with a 6.3-inch FHD+ IPS display which simply put, feels other-worldly. The combination of a nearly bezel-less panel, solid viewing angles, and accurate colours make the display of the V9 arguably its best feature and over the course of my review, I found myself using the smartphone more over my laptop to watch movies and stream videos. The display boasts adequate peak and minimum brightness levels too and even ships with a built-in blue light filter software to reduce the strain on your eyes, which is bound to happen since you’ll spend the better part of your day staring at the smartphone’s gorgeous display. Oh, and the notch? Well, I barely noticed it after setting up the smartphone and playing with it for a few hours. To me, the added screen real-estate and a superior screen-to-body ratio offer a lot more value. Moreover, even though most applications don’t leverage the smartphone’s full display right now, the scenery will change in the future since the next iteration of Android dubbed Android P allows developers to program apps specifically for notch-based smartphones. As it stands, the unique 19:9 aspect ratio of the display makes it so that the majority of the content when viewed on the screen gets cropped. Therefore, you’ll be gaming and watching videos on a significantly smaller screen which is a bummer, though that’s a compromise you’ll have to make with almost every notch-based Android smartphone in the market.   One key difference between the design of the Vivo V9 and the iPhone X is that the former ships with a fingerprint sensor for biometric authentication whereas the latter does not. In traditional Vivo fashion, the fingerprint sensor on the V9 is extremely accurate and it unlocks the smartphone in the blink of an eye. Moreover, the smartphone also comes with face unlock too, which works well in a well-lit room, albeit is a bit iffy when there’s not sufficient light around  All in all, Vivo has managed to knock the ball out of the park with the design and the display of the V9. Despite using plastic, the smartphone easily matches up to some other high-end offerings in terms of the in-hand feel and the display is just really pretty to look at. The only flaw I can think of is that the display doesn’t merge seamlessly with the back of the smartphone and instead, rests on top of a plastic trim. However, I didn’t give much thought to it after using the smartphone for a day or two.  Let’s get the obvious out of the way first – the 24MP selfie camera on the Vivo V9 is incredible. If you like to look at all the blemishes on your face at a microscopic level, then the V9 is the phone for you. In all seriousness, the smartphone captures some of the most detailed selfies I’ve ever seen, which coupled with its built-in beauty mode ensures that you never have to go to a salon for a makeover ever again. While the smartphone doesn’t feature an LED flash module upfront, you do get the option of turning on the screen flash which lights up the smartphone’s 6.3-inch display to give you some good-looking night-time selfies. You also get the option of clicking selfies in Bokeh mode, which was absent on the V7+ I reviewed a while back. As far as the quality of the portraits is concerned, the smartphone manages to separate the subject from the background really well, but the edges turned out a tad bit soft.  As far as the specs of the rear camera are concerned, the Vivo V9 ships with a pair of 16MP and 5MP sensors at the back with f/2.0 and f/2.4 aperture respectively. In terms of quality, I must say, the V9 might be one of the best affordable smartphones I’ve used for casual photography. If you don’t like to play with complicated camera settings just want a smartphone which clicks nice photos, then the Vivo V9 is a solid option which doesn’t break the bank. Over the course of my review period, I clicked a bunch of photos with the smartphone and was amazed by the handset’s built-in HDR mode.  As can be seen from the sample images, the details in photos with the HDR setting turned on are significantly better, the colours look more natural and the shadows and the highlights in a scene pop out as well. Moreover, the V9’s rear camera managed to retain a lot of details even when I clicked pictures in lowlight. You also get the option of clicking pictures in bokeh mode owing to the presence of two sensors at the back. Much like the selfie-bokeh shots I took with the smartphone, the rear bokeh shots also turn out well, albeit have soft edges. Last but not the least, the smartphone also ships with an ‘AR stickers’ mode which overlays funky stickers on the subject.  The good news? The Vivo V9 ships with Android Oreo v8.1 out of the box. The bad news? The heavy custom skin on top of Android Oreo is a far cry from stock Android. Now, depending on how you like your dessert served, you might fancy the makeover Vivo has given to Android Oreo. Unfortunately, I am not a big fan of the skin and during my review, I noticed that the UI transitions got significantly better once I switched to Nova launcher. In terms of features, the smartphone has an edge over the competition’s Android Nougat offerings since the V9 supports functions like Picture-in-Picture mode which are specific to Android Oreo. Other than that, most of the software features are same across previous Vivo smartphones, including support for theming, smart split and a game mode which enhances a user’s gaming experience by giving them the option to automatically block/take calls and messages while gaming. Spec-heads will be delighted to hear that the V9 is powered by a Snapdragon 626 processor which works alongside 4GB of RAM. For the uninitiated, the SD626 chip comes as the successor to the Snapdragon 625 processor and offers a 10 percent bump in performance. Moreover, similar to its predecessor, the SD626 processor strikes a good balance between performance and battery life too, which I’ll talk more about in a later part of this review. In terms of daily usage, the Vivo V9 managed to surpass my expectations and didn’t stumble even when I was juggling between a plethora of applications. That said, I did notice a bit of lag when I was browsing through the feed on some demanding applications like Facebook and Snapchat.  On the flip side, cranking up the graphics settings to max on games like Unkilled and Respawnables didn’t result in any frame drops and the smartphone managed to keep the temperature under control too. Moreover, thanks to the smartphone’s 64GB of built-in, user-expandable memory, you can download all the apps you’d like and not risk running out of storage anytime soon. Unfortunately, the positioning of the speaker is a bit of a letdown and makes it almost impossible to enjoy in-game audio.  In the battery department, the Vivo V9 ships with a non-removable 3,260mAh cell which thanks to the smartphone’s battery-efficient processor, easily saw me through the end of a day. The only downside is that the smartphone doesn’t feature quick charging and therefore, you’ll have to plug the device overnight to ensure you wake up to 100 percent charge levels in the morning. Priced at Rs 22,990, the Vivo V9 is a solid smartphone which brings a lot of interesting features to the table, including a gorgeous display, impressive battery life, good performance and capable cameras on both, the front as well as the back. However, the smartphone market, especially the affordable segment at that has become extremely competitive over the years and for almost Rs 5K less, you can get your hands on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (review) which offers significantly better performance, a better build owing to its unibody metal design, a beefier battery and a comparable if not better rear camera.  With that said, the fact that the Vivo V9 ships with Android Oreo out of the box is a huge plus and I’m certain that the smartphone’s front camera is also slightly better than what you get with the Redmi Note 5 Pro. Moreover, it’s a lot easier to get your hands on the V9 over the Redmi Note 5 Pro, which is almost always out of stock. Had Vivo priced its offering more competitively, I would’ve given my recommendation to the V9. However, as it stands, I feel that the Redmi Note 5 Pro offers a much better value for your money.  "
2269,30,32488,3.5,5,2018-05-29,,32488,Nitansh Rastogi -,Vivo X21 review: a bold step forward towards the era of all-screen smartphones,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/vivo-x21-review?pid=32488," The Latin meaning of the word Vivo is “full of life“, and if we take a look at the growth of the smartphone brand bearing this moniker, it’s easy to draw parallels. The manufacturer is still quite young in the smartphone industry, and yet, has an impressive portfolio of smartphones. Vivo is also among the fastest-growing brands in India, thanks to its extensive retail presence and focus on the latest trends like selfies and bezel-free displays. But now the phonemaker is taking its biggest leap in the Indian phone market. Not only is it entering the premium territory, but it’s also bringing a feature that has never made it to commercial products so far – the under-display fingerprint scanner. But is that one feature enough to make the new Vivo X21 stand out from the crowd? That’s what I intend to find out in this review. Vivo has been making bezel-less phones for quite a while. The brand first adopted the tall 18:9 display ratio with the V7+ (review), a phone that was launched last year in September. Then the brand upped the ante and launched the notch-toting V9 (review). The new Vivo X21 seems to be pushing the boundaries even further. The X21 sports minimal bezels, a cut-out up top and a chin at the bottom. All that, combined with rounded corners and curved edges makes the X21 among the sexiest smartphones in the market.While the handset has a thickness of 7.4mm, its edges are tapered and give the impression that it’s slimmer. Tipping the scales at 156.2g, the Vivo X21 is quite lightweight too. All this means that the smartphone not only has the looks, but is ergonomic too. Despite its ultra-wide screen measuring 6.28-inches, it’s not difficult to use the phone with a single hand. If you have large hands, you won’t have any trouble reaching the corners of the display either. The Vivo X21 has a glass finish at the back, which lends a premium appeal to the smartphone, and thankfully, isn’t as much of a fingerprint magnet as smartphones with glass panels. That said, the back is still susceptible to scratches and nicks. The phone does come bundled with a protective TPU cover. The aluminium frame also provides strength to the smartphone.The 6.28-inch display on the X21 is a full HD+ affair with a 19:9 aspect ratio. The Super AMOLED panel offers brilliant colours and impressive brightness levels, and is quite legible even outdoors. The screen is sharp and makes for an immersive experience while watching movies, reading e-books and playing games. No, we aren’t ignoring the notch – and our opinion about it hasn’t changed. It’s a distraction, and is noticeable especially while viewing Instagram Stories or WhatsApp Status, since it overlaps with content. The same isn’t apparent while viewing videos as they don’t take up the entire screen. While the phone doesn’t give you the option to disable the notch, it doesn’t try to open apps in full-screen mode by default. However, you’ll still see some apps and content (like stories) opening in full screen and spoiling the experience. Another odd thing is that you can’t stretch YouTube videos to make use of the larger real estate, and there are noticeable black bars on the top and bottom.  Thanks to the AMOLED panel, the Vivo X21 also offers an always-on display, letting you see the date and time, along with the battery status. You can customise the look and type of the clock or even choose a background, though this feature only offers missed notifications for calls, messages and WhatsApp, and not email or from other apps.  The Vivo X21 follows conventional placement for ports and controls, except for the SIM card slot, which strangely enough, has been placed on the base (in fact, it took me a while to figure out where it’s located while trying to pop in my SIM). Another grouse with the handset is the fact that it sticks to the old micro-USB standard for charging and data transfers. We’ve been hearing about under-the-screen / invisible fingerprint scanners for quite a while now. From Apple to Samsung, many brands have been rumoured to incorporate this feature in their offerings in order to offer all-screen fronts. However, it looks like Vivo has beaten much bigger rivals in this area. Not only did the brand showcase this technology first with a prototype back in June 2017 at MWC Shanghai, it also became the world’s first manufacturer to launch a commercial smartphone with an under-display fingerprint reader.  So how does it work? Developed by Synaptics, the sensor captures the reflection of the fingerprint between and through the OLED panels to authenticate the user. But the real question is – is it a big deal? Well, from the design perspective, it certainly is. A few things that normally stop phonemakers from offering a full-screen fascia include the front camera, the proximity and ambient sensors and the front fingerprint scanner. Of course, manufacturers can choose to place the biometric reader at the back, but that placement isn’t that useful. They can opt for the face unlock as well, a technology that has evolved over time to become really handy and fast as well. However, the flip side is that face unlock isn’t as secure, and doesn’t work in all situations either. Therefore, the Vivo X21’s in-screen fingerprint scanner, comes across as an interesting option, and one that can possibly make way for more phones with all-screen fronts. Having said that, the under-display fingerprint reader has ways to go. First up, it requires up to a minute to set up a fingerprint, as compared to conventional fingerprint sensors, which can be set up within 10 to 15 seconds. Secondly, while the under-display fingerprint scanner on the X21 is accurate, it isn’t as fast as regular fingerprint readers. You’ll need to press hard on the designated area to unlock the smartphone – akin to iPhone’s 3D Touch – and even then, it might not work. Even after a week with the smartphone, I never figured out the ideal level of pressure to be applied with my thumb to unlock the phone. However, I must say that the animation while unlocking the phone is quite cool and you can customise it too. The scanner can work in different conditions as well, including under direct sunlight. It’s also triggered automatically when you have to use apps that require fingerprint authentication, while using payment apps or while transacting on the Google Play Store for example.   If you don’t like unlocking the X21 in this manner, then you can enable the face unlock feature, which is incredibly fast. It’s secure too and doesn’t work when one’s eyes are closed. In fact, I was quite surprised by its speed and the fact that it can even work in dim settings. It recognised me even when I was wearing sunglasses, though it struggles under harsh lighting.  The Vivo X21 features a dual-camera setup with a 12-megapixel f/1.8 primary snapper and a 5MP depth sensor. Interestingly enough, that seems to be a downgrade from the V9 (review), which offers 16-meg primary shooter. The camera on the X21 comes with features such as phase detection autofocus and dual-pixel autofocus technology for locking focus quickly and better low-light capabilities. For selfies, Vivo has offered a 12-meg shooter on the front of its latest smartphone. The camera interface is filled to the brim with modes and options. In the portrait orientation, you’ll find the shutter button, effects, the ability to switch to the front camera and the option to preview captured images. Above that, you’ll find different modes such as photo, video, AR stickers, pro, and panorama, among others. Up top, there are toggles for the flash and the HDR mode, along with options to enable the portrait mode, live photo, as well as access to settings.   The Vivo X21 is a capable shooter that should serve your purposes in various situations. Images taken in ample light show a high level of detail and natural colour reproduction. The HDR mode is quite effective too and makes the shot all the more pleasing. The Portrait mode is impressive, with edges being detected well and separated well from the background, and you even get an option to customise the level of blur by tweaking the aperture. You can get some depth-of-field effects with the primary snapper as well. Images taken in poor lighting are also quite impressive in terms of detail, though noise is visible when the images are viewed in full resolution. Of course, the captured selfies are quite detailed and offer vibrant colours, although the beautify mode seem to be quite aggressive. You can get a software-based bokeh mode with the front camera too, and while it’s artificial, the X21 tries to do a good job in ensuring that the subject stands out from the rest of the background. Take a look at the camera samples of the Vivo X21 (click here to view full-size images Overall, the X21’s camera prowess won’t disappoint, but falls short of the competition such as the OnePlus 6 (camera review) and Honor 10. The Vivo X21 comes with the heavily-skinned FunTouch OS, which is based on Android 8.1 Oreo. The custom interface comes with a lot of bloatware such as Facebook, WPS Office and Amazon Shopping, though the good thing is that you can uninstall the apps you don’t need. The interface is different from Android in more ways than one. For instance, swiping from the top only brings the notification bar, and the control centre (quick toggles) pop up by swiping from the bottom. Similarly, the split-screen option isn’t present in the multitasking bar, and you can access it by using a three-finger swipe on the app or going to the control centre and selecting ‘Multiple tasks’.    That’s not to say that the skin doesn’t come with any useful options. Along with apps like iManager, it also comes with a Game Mode, which blocks all notifications and even gives you an option to route calls to the speaker to let you play distraction-free. The good thing is that you can add apps like Netflix in this mode too to ensure that you can catch up on your favourite movie or TV show without any distractions. Another useful option is to open messaging apps in the split-screen by default, in case you get a notification. The app shows up as a floating icon and clicking on it opens in the split screen.  If you want to enjoy the full screen experience, then you can enable gestures instead of using the on-screen navigation bar. These are not much different than the gestures on Android P – swipe from the bottom to return to the homescreen, swipe from the bottom and pause to access recent apps, and so on and so forth. However, considering that the smartphone’s control centre is initiated by swiping from the bottom, it becomes quite confusing when you enable navigation gestures. In this case, the control center can be brought up by swiping from the left, which takes some getting used to.    Powering the show on the Vivo X21 is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 660 SoC, which comes with a 2.2GHz octa-core processor and Adreno 512 graphics. While the SD660 SoC hasn’t been utilised by many phonemakers, it’s one of the most powerful chips in the upper mid-range, and that shows in the performance of the smartphone. The phone flies through any task thrown at it, be it navigation or running heavy apps or games. Coupled with 6 gigs of RAM, the hardware can handle multiple tasks with ease. Howver, the phone doesn’t seem to keep the last state of apps in its memory for long periods of time, and if you open one from the multitasking menu, the app will restart.  Playing Asphalt 8: Airborne or the popular PUBG game on the Vivo X21 is a delight, and the phone runs them smoothly. There are no frame drops and the graphics are rendered smoothly as well. The handset also manages to keep thermals under check, and doesn’t heat up even after playing games for 30 to 40 minutes continuously. However, the performance isn’t all smooth and there’s some trace of lag here and there, though I’d blame the heavy FunTouch OS for that. The X21 comes with 128GB of in-built memory, which can be topped up by another 256GB via a microSD card. However, you’ll need to compromise on the dual-SIM functionality to extend the storage.  The smartphone comes fuelled by a 3,200mAh battery, which might not seem much, but ensures that the phone doesn’t give up on you in the middle of the day. Even with heavy usage of streaming podcasts, watching videos, and using GPS, apart for calls and messages, the Vivo X21 can easily continue to the next working day on a single charge. In the 91mobiles test, the smartphone was able to run a 720p video on loop for about 14 hours, with both the brightness and volume levels set at 50 percent and only cellular network enabled. However, my only gripe is that the phone doesn’t support fast charging and takes more than two and a half hours to charge fully with the bundled adapter. There’s no doubt that the Vivo X21 helps put the Chinese brand on the global map. In an era where it’s hard to differentiate between smartphones basis their specs, the smartphone brings a meaningful differentiation to the table. But with the price tag of Rs 35,990, that’s not enough to make it stand apart from the competition, especially when its rivals include affordable flagships such as the Honor 10 (review) and OnePlus 6 (review). The X21 boasts a gorgeous design with a full-screen display, capable cameras and a long-lasting battery, but it can’t take on the OP6, which comes with the all-powerful Snapdragon 845 chipset. The Honor 10 is also a solid flagship with a compact design. Add to it the fact that the X21 doesn’t seem to be much different from the Vivo V9, which also comes with a notch display, but doesn’t sport as powerful internals and (of course), misses out on the under-display fingerprint scanner.  While the brand makes the futuristic under-the-screen fingerprint scanner a reality, the feature is still first gen, and needs refinement before becoming mainstream. All said and done, the Vivo X21 is certainly an exciting smartphone and even though it may or may not set the cash registers ringing for the brand, it suggests that the Chinese brand can innovate well (as the retractable camera-toting Apex concept would suggest).

2405,30,32182,,,2018-08-08,,32182,Prateek Pandey -,Xiaomi Mi A2 review: chasing Utopia,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-mi-a2-review?pid=32182," “The Xiaomi Redmi 5 is the most affordable bezel-less smartphone to come out of the company’s stables” It’s no secret that consumers looking for an affordable smartphone these days are spoilt for choice. Take offerings from the Chinese tech giant Xiaomi for instance. The company recently announced the Redmi Note 5 (review) and the Redmi Note 5 Pro (review), both of which were excellently received by consumers and critics alike. Now, less than a month later, the company has launched an even lower-priced smartphone in the form of the Redmi 5 (first impressions), which takes the brand’s tally up to three sub-Rs 15k smartphones in just the first quarter of 2018.  Now, we have already established that the Redmi Note 5 duo are excellent smartphones, but how good is the company’s latest offering, the Redmi 5? Should you buy it over the slightly more expensive Redmi Note 5? And how does it stack up against the competition? I intend on answering those questions and many others in this review. Stay with me. A trend which started with Xiaomi’s flagship smartphone, the Mi Mix, has now made its way over to the company’s budget offerings. You guessed it, I am talking about the Redmi 5’s bezel-less design which immediately gives the smartphone an edge over the competitor’s bezel-laden offerings. With that said, while Xiaomi has increased the screen-to-body ratio of the smartphone, the company has refrained from making any changes to the Redmi 5’s blueprint. In fact, from the back, you’d be hard-pressed to tell the difference between the Redmi Note 5, the Redmi 5 and the Redmi Note 4.  Be that as it may, the Redmi 5’s familiar design still feels solid and as far as the construction is concerned, the smartphone employs a mix of plastic and metal in its design. The frame of the smartphone has been constructed out of plastic, whereas the majority of the phone’s rear panel is metal, with the exception of two small sections on the top and the bottom which house the antenna bands. The smartphone feels really sleek and premium in the hand too, which is why I didn’t slap a case on my unit, even though the company bundles one with the retail packaging of the device. Moreover, thanks to its outstanding ergonomics and one-handed usability, I didn’t drop the Redmi 5 even once over the course of my review period.Your primary means of interacting with the Xiaomi Redmi 5 will be via its 5.7-inch, 18:9 aspect ratio, HD+ display. Since it’s a 720p panel stretched across a 5.7-inch canvas, you will be able to see some pixels here and there. On the flip side, the display has decent viewing angles and gets adequately bright (and dim) under direct sunlight. Moreover, you also get the option of changing the colour temperature of the display from within the settings as per your taste. I preferred the tone of the display on my unit of the Redmi 5 from the get-go and therefore, didn’t tweak it further.  Even though the Redmi 5 is a budget offering, Xiaomi has included a fingerprint sensor for biometric authentication which can be found towards the back of the device. During my testing, the sensor worked flawlessly and unlocked the smartphone in a jiffy every time I placed my index finger on it.  The cameras on the Xiaomi Redmi 5 are a bit of a sore point. In terms of specs, the handset features 12MP and 5MP sensors on the back and the front respectively. There’s a dedicated flash module present for both the camera sensors too, which helps with lowlight photography. Unfortunately, I wasn’t too impressed with the quality of the images shot from the Redmi 5. In situations with ample lighting, the smartphone manages to deliver decent quality pics with natural-looking colours. However, the smartphone takes a while to latch on to the subject and even then, the macro shots are often blurred. The low-light performance of the smartphone is nothing to write home about either, and the images I clicked with the device had substantial grain in them.    The smartphone’s front camera performance is average at best too. Selfies taken in a well-lit room had soft edges and were over-exposed. At night, despite using the dedicated selfie flash, most of the selfies I clicked still had significant noise in them.The Xiaomi Redmi 5 is powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 450 processor which works alongside either 2GB, 3GB or 4GB of RAM, depending upon which variant you opt for. Correspondingly, you’ll get either 16GB, 32GB or 64GB of built-in storage with the phone which can be further expanded by means of a microSD card. I had the 3GB / 32GB variant for review. As far as the performance is concerned, I was pleasantly surprised with the Snapdragon 450’s capabilities. Having previously reviewed the Redmi 5A which shipped with a Snapdragon 425 processor, I can confidently say that those upgrading to the Redmi 5 will observe a significant bump in the performance. Navigating through the UI was noticeably better on the Redmi 5, as was opening and closing applications. Moreover, my gaming sessions on the smartphone weren’t just limited to some PvP battles in Clash Royale and I could run more demanding titles like Unkilled too, albeit with slightly toned-down graphics settings.  Having said that, bear in mind that the Xiaomi Redmi 5 is a budget smartphone at the end of the day and therefore, you will notice a drop in speed if you push the smartphone too hard. Moreover, the smartphone struggles to keep applications in memory too and since the load times for certain applications is quite high, you will have to take a note of not opening certain apps together. For instance, during my usage, I made a mental note to not open Onefootball and Snapchat together, since both the are fairly resource-hungry applications. Another thing I’d like to point out is that while the smartphone managed to stay cool during day-to-day usage, the temperatures spiked to an uncomfortable number when the phone was put on charge.  Speaking of which, the Redmi 5 delivers excellent battery life, despite shipping with just a 3,300mAh cell. During my usage, I was easily able to get through the end of a day with heavy testing. Moreover, the smartphone recharges its battery fairly quickly.  The Redmi 5 runs MIUI v9 with Android Nougat as its base. My experience with the software on Xiaomi smartphones has been a bit of a rollercoaster ride. Initially, I wasn’t a fan of the custom platform, but Xiaomi has refined its UI quite a bit over the last year and the company keeps updating the OS with some nifty tweaks. This time around, it’s the presence of App Vault, an all-in-one aggregator which can be accessed by swiping left on the homescreen. Through App Vault, users will be able to view their calendar events, keep tabs on the latest cricket scores and even book cabs from Ola without having to install the application. Other than that, the rest of the software features on the Redmi 5, including support for theming and running two instances of an app at the same time can be found on other smartphones by the company too. The Xiaomi Redmi 5 is a solid smartphone and for the price, gets a lot of things right. The handset offers stable performance, boasts an impressive battery life and is perfect for buyers who want a bezel-less smartphone which doesn’t break the bank. The smartphone starts at Rs 7,999 for the 2GB RAM model and the price goes up to Rs 8,999 and Rs 10,999 for the 3GB and 4GB RAM models respectively. And therein lies the problem. You see, instead of spending Rs 10,999 on the Redmi 5’s top-tier variant, one could instead just go for the Redmi Note 5 which is priced similarly, and ships with a faster processor, a better display, better battery life and much better cameras.  Furthermore, if you are willing to compromise on the Redmi 5’s bezel-less design, then you can pick up the Redmi Y1 (review) instead, which ships with a significantly better selfie camera and is more or less the same in terms of core performance. The Infinix Hot S3 (review) is another solid option to consider, thanks to its bezel-less display, 20MP front camera and 4,000mAh battery. All in all, while I do feel that the Redmi 5 brings a lot of nifty features to the table, the smartphone is eclipsed by its own siblings.    "
2405,30,32182,,,2018-08-08,,32182,Prateek Pandey -,Xiaomi Mi A2 review: chasing Utopia,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-mi-a2-review?pid=32182," “Xiaomi’s latest affordable handset has a lot going for it, making it a perfect smartphone for buyers on a budget” Xiaomi has a reputation for making bang-for-buck smartphones and the company’s offerings have propelled the brand to the very top in the Indian smartphone industry. However, did you know that the first product to come off the company’s stables was not a smartphone but instead, a custom ROM by the name of MIUI? Back in the day, Xiaomi’s take on Android was going like hotcakes and even to this date, the company’s custom platform comes preloaded on a majority of its offerings.  That said, the market’s affinity for a smartphone with a near-stock OS has grown exponentially over the years and many prospective buyers longed for a smartphone from the company which shipped without MIUI. To cater to this segment, last year, the company announced an Android One mid-ranger in partnership with Google, dubbed the Mi A1 (review). That device rocked our boat with its capabilities and camera prowess, and turned out to be a bestseller for Xiaomi as well. Now, the company has announced the successor to the smartphone in the form of the Mi A2 (first impressions) which comes with an updated design and better internals. I’ve spent a few days with the smartphone and here’s what I make of it. And since its cameras form the mainstay, I’m going to jump straight into the phone’s imaging capabilities before I delve into the other aspects.  The Xiaomi Mi A1 was fondly called the ‘’poor man’s DSLR” when it was launched, as the handset took excellent photos. A year later, the smartphone’s successor takes its legacy forward by offering what I believe to be the best cameras on a smartphone priced south of Rs 20K. But, before I dive into any more details, let’s talk specs. Towards the back, the Xiaomi Mi A2 sports a dual camera setup with 12MP and 20MP sensors, both with f/1.75 apertures. The primary 12MP shooter utilises a Sony IMX486 sensor whereas the assisting 20MP shooter makes use of a Sony IMX 376 module. On the front, the handset comes equipped with a 20MP f/2.2 aperture selfie camera that makes use of Sony’s IMX 376 sensor.And while we’re here, let’s talk about the smartphone’s camera app too. Despite being an Android One device, the Mi A2 makes use of a custom camera app, which allows you to switch between different modes like Panorama, Manual, and Portrait by swiping left and right. The shutter button can be found at the bottom of the viewfinder, sandwiched between a quick-access shortcut for the gallery and a toggle to switch between the front and the rear cameras.   Related read: Xiaomi Mi A2 camera samples Now, as far as the quality of the images is concerned, the Xiaomi Mi A2 clicks stunning images in broad daylight. The cameras capture an abundance of details, the colours feel vibrant and even without turning on the built-in HDR mode, you’ll find sufficient dynamic range in the shots. That said, with the mode enabled, you’ll notice that the colours feel a lot punchier but the overall essence of the shot is preserved and the picture doesn’t seem unnatural. If you like to get close to your subjects, then you can achieve a crisp picture with a nice depth-of-field with the smartphone too. Moreover, thanks to the presence of two sensors at the back, you can click some really nice portraits with well-defined boundaries as well. Here are a few samples.iaomi claims that the cameras on the Mi A2 make use of ‘pixel binning’ technology to enhance the quality of the images shot under unfavourable lighting. Now, you must have noticed that pictures clicked in a dimly-lit environment often have grain and noise in them. Therefore, by means of pixel binning, the Xiaomi Mi A2’s 20MP assisting shooter combines (bins) the data from four pixels into one, which in turn increases the surface area for light to impact on. The resulting 5MP image is then converted back into a 20MP image by means of software interpolation. As per Xiaomi, the 20MP selfie shooter also makes use of the same technology Techno mumbo-jumbo aside, do the images look any better? Well, the answer isn’t as black and white as I’d like it to be. Although pixel binning does shed a light on the subject (quite literally), it also makes the images more grainy. As can be seen from the sample shots I’ve attached, while my face is a lot clearer on the second image, there’s also significantly more noise. If you do prefer the results obtained by pixel binning and were wondering how to replicate the same on your Mi A2, then head over to the pro mode in the camera application and switch the lens from ‘regular’ to ‘night mode.I don’t know about you, but my smartphone gallery almost always has more selfies than landscapes and thanks to the Mi A2’s fantastic selfie shooter, the number of selfies I took in a day shot up dramatically. Under ideal lighting conditions, the smartphone’s 20MP front shooter takes excellent selfies which are rich in detail and colours. The selfie portrait mode does a good job of blurring the background of the subject and as a bonus, it can focus simultaneously on two faces too. Moreover, thanks to the inclusion of a dedicated LED flash module, the quality of selfies taken at night doesn’t nosedive either. Simply put, the cameras on the Mi A2 are outstanding and the smartphone can easily rival some pricier offerings from the competition’s stables.For software, the Xiaomi Mi A2 runs a stock version of Android Oreo from the get-go. Since the handset is part of Google’s Android One initiative, you will get a no-frills Android experience from the device. As a matter of fact, outside of Google’s suite of necessary apps, you’ll only get four other pre-loaded apps on the smartphone from Xiaomi. Moreover, there’s just one gesture supported by the smartphone upon boot, which launches the camera from any screen if you double-tap the power button quickly. Everything considered, I’m sure the Mi A2’s no-nonsense software will find a lot of takers. I know most of you are here to see whether the handset can run PUBG or not. Well, the short answer is yes. Underneath its metal chassis, the Mi A2 is backed by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor which works alongside 4GB of RAM and 64GB of built-in, non-expandable storage. That said, Xiaomi will be bringing the 6GB RAM variant of the smartphone to the Indian shores too, which comes with 128GB of internal storage. As far as my overall impressions of the handset’s performance are concerned, I’m quite impressed with the smartphone. During my week-long review, I never came across any instance of lag or stutter on the phone. The handset comfortably managed to breeze through my usual array of social media apps running in the background, along with a few tabs of Chrome and Apple Music running simultaneously too. To satiate my gaming needs, I ran PUBG and the recently announced Asphalt 9: Legends on the smartphone. Both the titles ran without any hiccups, but I did have to tone the graphics settings down to medium on PUBG to achieve playable frame rates. All in all, Xiaomi’s Mi A2 is an excellent performer and will easily last you a while without showing any signs of slowing down. Interestingly, while the smartphone’s chassis did get warm when I was clicking a lot of pictures, the handset remained cool to the touch when I was gaming. I’ll say this right out the gate – I’m not a fan of the Xiaomi Mi A2’s design. Although the smartphone makes use of a unibody metal build which offers an excellent in-hand feel, the design of the smartphone doesn’t really excite. Don’t get me wrong, coming from the Xiaomi Mi A1, you’ll find a day-and-night difference in the smartphone’s style. In fact, the new phone is much slimmer and has a curvier rear as compared to its predecessor. However, the Mi A2 looks almost the same as many other Xiaomi handsets launched this year with its curvy back, vertically aligned dual-cameras, a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and the ‘MI’ branding at the bottom.  Now, I can look past the design similarities of the Mi A2, but what I can’t get over is the handset’s pronounced camera bump. Blame it on the slimmer body, but every time I look at it, the protrusion reminds me of Black Eyed Peas famous song My Humps. Only this time, the hump isn’t ‘lovely’ and makes it tough to use the smartphone when it’s kept flat on a surface. Moreover, you also risk scratching the glass protecting the handset’s camera module. Suffice it to say, I would’ve liked Xiaomi to take a different route with the Mi A2’s design.  I was peeved at Xiaomi’s decision to omit the headphone jack from the smartphone too. Yup, the Mi A2 doesn’t come with a 3.5mm headset port, and as you can imagine, it’s not good news for an audiophile like me. Now, to the company’s credit, the handset does feature a built-in 10V amp, which paves way for an excellent audio experience provided you have the right set of earphones or headphones. Moreover, there is a USB Type-C to 3.5mm adapter bundled with the retail unit of the handset. But, the reliance on an adapter to listen to music is surely not going to sit well with serious audiophiles. On the positive side, the Xiaomi Mi A2 does sport an IR blaster on the top, which comes in handy when you’re too lazy to reach for the TV’s remote to change a channel. Moreover, the handset’s fingerprint sensor is rapid too and it manages to scan the fingerprint, recognise it and unlock the smartphone, all in under a second.  Display-wise, the Xiaomi Mi A2 is rocking a 5.99-inch FHD+ IPS panel with an aspect ratio of 18:9. The screen boasts excellent viewing angles albeit exhibits slightly muted colours. Moreover, since the Mi A2 is an Android One smartphone, you cannot tweak the display from within the settings menu. That being said, I was satisfied with the panel’s legibility in broad daylight and there was no noticeable colour shift when I tilted the display and viewed it from an angle either. The Xiaomi Mi A2 sips juice from a 3,010mAh battery which is just a hair shy of its predecessor’s 3,080mAh cell. However, the Mi A2 is sporting a significantly bigger display this time around and consequently, the smartphone barely managed to see me through the end of a day. During my usage, I was getting just around three hours of screen on time which included playing casual games like Clash Royale, browsing through my social media feeds, listening to music and watching videos on YouTube. Moreover, in our standard 91mobiles battery test, the handset managed to play a 720p video on loop for a just little over ten hours, which is an average result.   On the bright side, the Mi A2 is the first phone in India to ship with support for Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4.0. Unfortunately, the bundled wall charger maxes out at 2A and therefore, you’ll have to invest in a third-party charger if you want to leverage the smartphone’s uber-fast charging speeds. It must be noted however, that there isn’t even a single QC4.0-compatible adapter in the Indian market, as of writing this review.   The Mi A2 sports a bottom-firing speaker, which gets sufficiently loud. Therefore, you don’t have to fuss about connecting the phone to a Bluetooth speaker to enjoy Netflix. Speaking of which, there’s Bluetooth v5.0 onboard, so you should get better range and bandwidth if you’re connected to a device which supports the same. If you prefer to go the wired route, then the smartphone’s built-in 10V amplifier will go along nicely with your headphones. The Xiaomi Mi A2 retails for Rs 16,999 and faces stiff competition from mainly three smartphones currently available in India – the 6GB RAM variant of the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 (review), the company’s own Redmi Note 5 Pro (review) and the recently-launched Honor Play (first impressions). Now, the Mi A2 is backed by a superior processor than both the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 and therefore, it should fare better in the longer run. That said, performance-hungry users might be better off with the Honor Play, which ships with Huawei’s flagship Kirin 970 SoC. On the software side of things, the Mi A2 regains its lead as the smartphone is a certified Android One device, which means that the handset will get guaranteed updates for the next two years, including the latest Android 9.0 Pie. Camera-wise, you could pick up either of the four smartphones and be content with your decision. However, I felt that the images I clicked with the Mi A2 were a tad bit better than what the competition had to offer. That being said, the Mi A2’s battery life left me wanting for more and I wasn’t thrilled with the company’s decision to axe the headphone jack either. Lest I forget, the smartphone’s camera bump is aesthetically unappealing too.  Now, if you can look past these quibbles, then Xiaomi’s Mi A2 comes out on top when compared to the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1. However, the Honor Play makes things difficult for the new smartphone, as it seemingly offers better performance, expandable storage and a more powerful battery. That said, we’re yet to review the Honor Play and a clearer picture will only emerge after we’re done with that. The Mi A2’s camera capabilities, stock Android and the promise of timely platform updates are clear winners for sure, and if these aspects appeal to you, you can go ahead and pick up the latest from Xiaomi — it won’t disappoint you. "

Now, we have already established that the Redmi Note 5 duo are excellent smartphones, but how good is the company’s latest offering, the Redmi 5? Should you buy it over the slightly more expensive Redmi Note 5? And how does it stack up against the competition? I intend on answering those questions and many others in this review. Stay with me. A trend which started with Xiaomi’s flagship smartphone, the Mi Mix, has now made its way over to the company’s budget offerings. You guessed it, I am talking about the Redmi 5’s bezel-less design which immediately gives the smartphone an edge over the competitor’s bezel-laden offerings.

Since it’s a 720p panel stretched across a 5.7-inch canvas, you will be able to see some pixels here and there. On the flip side, the display has decent viewing angles and gets adequately bright (and dim) under direct sunlight.

I preferred the tone of the display on my unit of the Redmi 5 from the get-go and therefore, didn’t tweak it further.

In terms of specs, the handset features 12MP and 5MP sensors on the back and the front respectively. There’s a dedicated flash module present for both the camera sensors too, which helps with lowlight photography. Unfortunately, I wasn’t too impressed with the quality of the images shot from the Redmi 5. In situations with ample lighting, the smartphone manages to deliver decent quality pics with natural-looking colours. However, the smartphone takes a while to latch on to the subject and even then, the macro shots are often blurred. The low-light performance of the smartphone is nothing to write home about either, and the images I clicked with the device had substantial grain in them.    The smartphone’s front camera performance is average at best too. Selfies taken in a well-lit room had soft edges and were over-exposed. At night, despite using the dedicated selfie flash, most of the selfies I clicked still had significant noise in them.The Xiaomi Redmi 5 is powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 450 processor which works alongside either 2GB, 3GB or 4GB of RAM, depending upon which variant you opt for. Correspondingly, you’ll get either 16GB, 32GB or 64GB of built-in storage with the phone which can be further expanded by means of a microSD card. I had the 3GB / 32GB variant for review. As far as the performance is concerned, I was pleasantly surprised with the Snapdragon 450’s capabilities. Having previously reviewed the Redmi 5A which shipped with a Snapdragon 425 processor, I can confidently say that those upgrading to the Redmi 5 will observe a significant bump in the performance.

Now that we have spent some time with the new offering from the company, here’s a detailed review of the Redmi 6 Pro.  If you look at the back of the handset, you will find that the company has retained the exact same design from the Redmi Note 5 Pro on the Redmi 6 Pro. There is a vertically-stacked dual camera module on the top left, with the LED flash sandwiched in between the lenses. The fingerprint sensor is placed right in the middle, where it is easily accessible. Even though the handset’s body is primarily made out of plastic, the Redmi 6 Pro feels sturdy in the hand. The volume rocker and power button are located on the right spine of the handset, while the SIM card slot can be found on the left. There is a micro-USB charging port at the bottom with holes on both sides. On the top, you’ll find the IR blaster and the headphone jack. Much like some of the other smartphones launched this year, the Redmi 6 Pro offers a large screen in a compact factor, thanks to a slim bezel design. The cutout at the top of the display houses the front camera as well as the earpiece. Notably, the bezels on the left, right, and bottom of the display are still thicker than you would find on some other handsets that claim to offer bezel-less designs.I found no issues in accessing the buttons on the handset and the phone doesn’t feel slippery or heavy in the hand either. Except for the notch, the design offered by the Redmi 6 Pro feels slightly boring, especially when we consider that some of the mid-range handsets are now offering a premium glass sandwich designs at affordable prices. Here’s a closer look at the design. The Redmi 6 Pro features a 5.84-inch full HD+ (2,280 x 1,080 pixels) IPS LCD display with a taller-than-usual aspect ratio of 19:9. I found the display to be vibrant but slightly oversaturated. The viewing angles are good, and the images as well as text, appear crisp on the display. While this observation is getting slightly old, it is important to point out that the screen cut-out never feels like much of an issue and when you are watching videos on YouTube app, the notch doesn’t come in the way as it is covered up by a neat uniform bezel.  Further, the taller-than-usual aspect ratio makes it noticeably easier to handle multitasking. The maximum brightness level offered by the handset’s screen is impressive and makes it easy to use even outdoors under bright sunlight. The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro comes with a dual-camera module at the rear, consisting of a 12MP primary sensor with a f/2.2 aperture and a secondary 5MP f/2.2 depth sensor, accompanied by an LED flash. At the front, the phone has a 5MP camera for selfies and video calls. Having spent some time clicking pictures in both daylight as well as poor lighting conditions, I can safely say that the camera performance offered by the Redmi 6 Pro is good for its price range. However, for what it’s worth, the low light performance and selfie camera still leave room for improvement as there are some exposure and detail issues in these conditions. In the default camera app, you get the option to click the image in Portrait, Square, Panorama, and manual modes. In the manual mode, you can adjust ISO and white balance to take better images and apart from regular video shooting mode, there is a short video mode that allows you to shoot small video clips of just 10 seconds.  There are tons of customisation options that allow you to click pictures with the fingerprint sensor and show grid lines among other things. You can check out the camera gallery below to figure out the quality of images by yourself.he new Redmi handset runs Android Oreo-based MIUI 9 out of the box and comes with all the features that you might expect out of a Xiaomi phone. Our Chinese unit came out of the box filled with some bloatware but users can expect other features like dual apps, lite mode, and Full Screen Display, which will make way to units across regions, if and when the handset is launched outside China I found the overall user experience offered by the Redmi 6 Pro to be fairly clean and did not face any stutter issues while navigating through the platform.Moving to the hardware aspect, the new Redmi handset is powered by Snapdragon 625 SoC coupled with Adreno 506 GPU and either 3GB or 4GB of RAM, depending upon the variant. As you might have guessed, Xiaomi is trying to serve old wine in a new-ish bottle over here. Xiaomi has offered the same processor in the Redmi Note 4, Redmi Note 5, Mi A1, and Mi Max 2 earlier. Worth mentioning that our unit comes with 3GB of RAM.  The smartphone handled some graphically demanding games like PUBG and Injustice 2 relatively well. I did not face any heating issues but there were occasional hiccups, though not far too often to ruin the experience. The Second Space feature allows you to install apps and keep pictures separately for security. If we talk about the AI-based Face Unlock feature, the handset manages to offer convenience but we are not too sure about the security. This is because we managed to unlock the handset even in poor lighting conditions as well as with part of our face covered. Due to the presence of the notch, apps and games are usually displayed with a black strip on that side of the screen. Oddly enough, when you try to take a screenshot in these apps and games, the screen grab also features a thick black strip, which is not the case with other phones that come with the notch display design.  The Redmi 6 Pro packs a rather massive 4,000mAh battery. Given this particular specification, it should not come as a surprise that the handset easily manages to last beyond a day under regular as well as heavy use. To give you further perspective, in our HD video loop test, the handset managed to last around 20 hours.   Effectively, this all means that the smartphone from Xiaomi won’t disappoint you if you are heading out for a road trip and planning to catch up on a TV series or watch a movie or two. At this point, we would seriously appreciate if all phones would offer this kind of battery life across price ranges.  The Redmi 6 Pro can be described as a horse for all courses. The handset looks good, comes with the trendy notch design, and packs a massive battery. Although Snapdragon 625 feels like a dated processor at this point, the SoC gets the job done. Currently, the 3GB RAM and 4GB RAM variants of the smartphone are retailing for CNY 1,199 (roughly Rs 12,300) and CNY 1,299 (roughly Rs 13,300), respectively in China. If launched in India around the same price, the handset will be competing against the likes of the Realme 1 (review) and the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 (review), both of which feature better processors. In fact, at that price, the Redmi 6 Pro could even go up against its own sibling, the popular Redmi Note 5 Pro. We will update this review as and when Xiaomi decides to launch the Redmi 6 Pro in India officially.   Photos by Raj Rout"
2413,30,32331,,,2018-09-25,,32331,Shekhar Thakran -,Xiaomi Redmi 6 review: holds substance but lacks style,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-6-review?pid=32331," “The face unlock feature on the Redmi 6 is fairly reliable and quick to function as well” Xiaomi’s Redmi series has taken the affordable smartphone segment in India market by storm in the last couple of years, as the brand continues to push out handsets that offer the best value for money in their respective price segments. For a really long time, there was no real competition to the phones offered by the Redmi series, but this comfortable lead has recently been threatened by some other brands like Realme and ASUS. In this competitive environment, does the brand’s latest entry, the Xiaomi Redmi 6, have what it takes to retain the top spot? Read our detailed review to get the answer.  Even as almost every other brand is now trying to incorporate glass sandwich designs on their smartphones, Xiaomi wants to stick to the basics. The Redmi 6 comes with the same design language as most other handsets in the affordable price segment by the company. A majority of the handset’s body has been made out of plastic and unfortunately, the phone does not feel premium in the hand or from a distance. On the positive side, the dual camera setup at the back does not protrude much from the phone’s body and is placed on the top left side. The fingerprint sensor is placed slightly below the camera module, towards the centre. We can assure you that you will face no discomfort in reaching the fingerprint sensor with your index finger, even when using the phone with a single hand The speaker grille is located below the ‘Mi’ logo towards the lower side at the back, which proves to be an issue at times when you are watching videos or listening to music as you cannot put the phone on its back. Similar to many other phones, you get the volume rocker and the power button on the right spine of the phone, and the SIM card slot on the left side along with dedicated microSD card slot. The micro-USB charging port occupies the bottom side of the phone, whereas the 3.5mm audio jack is placed on the top of the handset. Here   In terms of ergonomics, the Redmi 6 is easy to hold in one hand and does not feel heavy. The volume rocker and power buttons are tactile and easily accessible too. Adopting the 18:9 display standard, the Redmi 6 ships with a 5.45-inch HD+ (1,440 x 720 pixels) IPS LCD panel. Having said that, the bezels on the top and bottom of the display cannot be described as slim by any means. The top bezel notably comes with an LED notification light on the left side. As far as the display quality is concerned, the panel looks vibrant and sharp for the most part. The peak brightness level ensures that the handset remains usable in outdoor conditions but is not extremely impressive. The viewing angles are good and you will not face any issues in this department. If you are the sort of person who watches a lot of multimedia content on the phone, the Redmi 6’s display is among the best in the affordable price range. As mentioned earlier, the Redmi 6 comes with a rear-facing dual camera setup that consists of a primary 12MP sensor and a 5MP secondary sensor, assisted by an LED flash module. In our time with the smartphone, we found that the Redmi 6 managed to take decent shots, though the phone was largely dependent on lighting conditions to produce good results. The default camera app offers various modes, including Portrait, Square, Panorama, and Manual. The manual mode essentially allows users to adjust the white balance and ISO levels to help them click pictures as per their liking.The Portrait mode, as you might have guessed, allows the handset to click pictures with a focus on the subject and blur the background to achieve a bokeh effect. Notably, this feature is available with both the front and rear camera setups. In our testing, the portrait mode did not produce particularly impressive results but someone who is looking for this feature at a pocket-friendly price, this is a welcome addition. You can also click pictures in HDR mode, with the option provided right up front in the camera app. At the front, you get a 5MP sensor with f/2.2 aperture lens and 1.12um pixels size. The pictures taken by the front camera were not particularly impressive in indoor conditions but the phone manages to take decent images outdoors.
     see in the samples shared above, the images clicked by the Redmi 6 in low-light conditions had considerable noise and grain. Keeping in mind that we are talking about an affordable segment phone, we can give this particular aspect a pass.  Xiaomi Redmi 6 runs Android 8.1 Oreo-based MIUI 9.6 out of the box. If you are familiar with the company’s mobile software interface, you would find yourself just at home with the new handset. There are utility tools and some pre-installed apps but the platform comes across fairly clutter-free and without much bloatware.  For security, apart from the fingerprint sensor, the handset provides a face unlock feature. We found this feature to be really quick to function. Additionally, the face unlock is also reliable as it does not unlock the handset if your eyes are closed. There are some other features like Full screen display and Second Space, which allow you to make use of gestures for associated functionalities and provide separate space for privacy, respectively. The smartphone is powered by a Helio P22 SoC, coupled with 3GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of built-in storage. We did not face any issues with the performance offered by the Redmi 6 and there were no lags or hiccups navigating through the platform. Light apps and games were handled well by the smartphone but demanding games like PUBG and Injustice 2 posed difficulties for the Redmi 6, even at the lowest graphics settings.  We are usually impressed by the battery backup offered by the Xiaomi smartphones in general and the Redmi 6 continues this positive trend. Despite packing a not-so-massive 3,000mAh battery, the handset managed to last around 16 hours in our HD video loop test. However, it took us around three hours to charge the phone from zero to 100 percent.   For those who are constantly on the go and fear running out of charge, the Redmi 6 can prove to be a worthy companion. In our daily use, we managed to go through a full day on a single charge with medium usage, but heavy users might have to find the charger before the end of the day. The Xiaomi Redmi 6 brings along some interesting features like a dual camera setup, an 18:9 HD+ display, and an impressive battery backup for a starting price of Rs 7,999. If we compare the handset with its direct rival, the Realme 2 (review), which is price Rs 1,000 higher, you get a better design and battery backup with the latter. Considering that the Realme 2 comes with a notch design, which is increasingly finding favour among prospective buyers, and thin bezels around the display, it might win over some users from Xiaomi. It would be interesting to see if Xiaomi brings a radical design shift to its handsets in the coming months as this is the only aspect where it seems to be losing ground to the new entrants.

The Xiaomi Redmi 6 brings along some interesting features like a dual camera setup, an 18:9 HD+ display, and an impressive battery backup for a starting price of Rs 7,999. If we compare the handset with its direct rival, the Realme 2 (review), which is price Rs 1,000 higher, you get a better design and battery backup with the latter. Considering that the Realme 2 comes with a notch design, which is increasingly finding favour among prospective buyers, and thin bezels around the display, it might win over some users from Xiaomi. It would be interesting to see if Xiaomi brings a radical design shift to its handsets in the coming months as this is the only aspect where it seems to be losing ground to the new entrants.

2413,30,32331,,,2018-09-25,,"Overall, the rear cameras offer solid results across different shooting conditions. The images turn out crisp and natural, and you also get an HDR mode which is quite effective, without being too obtrusive or making the images look artificial. Low-light shots turned out quite good too, and don’t show too much noise. On the flip side, the default camera app on the Redmi Note 5 Pro doesn’t offer an option to shoot video at 4K, and this is surprising considering the chipset supports it. I wouldn’t really hold this against the Pro though. Here are some images shot using the Redmi Note 5 Pro One new feature worth mentioning is App Vault, which gets its own dedicated panel that pops out when you swipe right from the main home screen. App Vault gives you a bunch of customisable cards, which include shortcuts to apps and tasks, notes, cricket scores, and calendar. It even integrates Ola, allowing you to book cabs directly without needing the Ola app. Thanks to AI capabilities, the device will also get face unlock capabilities via an OTA update, which will be rolled out in March. ",Shekhar Thakran -,Xiaomi Redmi 6 review: holds substance but lacks style,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-6-review?pid=32331," “The face unlock feature on the Redmi 6 is fairly reliable and quick to function as well” Xiaomi’s Redmi series has taken the affordable smartphone segment in India market by storm in the last couple of years, as the brand continues to push out handsets that offer the best value for money in their respective price segments. For a really long time, there was no real competition to the phones offered by the Redmi series, but this comfortable lead has recently been threatened by some other brands like Realme and ASUS. In this competitive environment, does the brand’s latest entry, the Xiaomi Redmi 6, have what it takes to retain the top spot? Read our detailed review to get the answer.  Even as almost every other brand is now trying to incorporate glass sandwich designs on their smartphones, Xiaomi wants to stick to the basics. The Redmi 6 comes with the same design language as most other handsets in the affordable price segment by the company. A majority of the handset’s body has been made out of plastic and unfortunately, the phone does not feel premium in the hand or from a distance. On the positive side, the dual camera setup at the back does not protrude much from the phone’s body and is placed on the top left side. The fingerprint sensor is placed slightly below the camera module, towards the centre. We can assure you that you will face no discomfort in reaching the fingerprint sensor with your index finger, even when using the phone with a single hand The speaker grille is located below the ‘Mi’ logo towards the lower side at the back, which proves to be an issue at times when you are watching videos or listening to music as you cannot put the phone on its back. Similar to many other phones, you get the volume rocker and the power button on the right spine of the phone, and the SIM card slot on the left side along with dedicated microSD card slot. The micro-USB charging port occupies the bottom side of the phone, whereas the 3.5mm audio jack is placed on the top of the handset. Here   In terms of ergonomics, the Redmi 6 is easy to hold in one hand and does not feel heavy. The volume rocker and power buttons are tactile and easily accessible too. Adopting the 18:9 display standard, the Redmi 6 ships with a 5.45-inch HD+ (1,440 x 720 pixels) IPS LCD panel. Having said that, the bezels on the top and bottom of the display cannot be described as slim by any means. The top bezel notably comes with an LED notification light on the left side. As far as the display quality is concerned, the panel looks vibrant and sharp for the most part. The peak brightness level ensures that the handset remains usable in outdoor conditions but is not extremely impressive. The viewing angles are good and you will not face any issues in this department. If you are the sort of person who watches a lot of multimedia content on the phone, the Redmi 6’s display is among the best in the affordable price range. As mentioned earlier, the Redmi 6 comes with a rear-facing dual camera setup that consists of a primary 12MP sensor and a 5MP secondary sensor, assisted by an LED flash module. In our time with the smartphone, we found that the Redmi 6 managed to take decent shots, though the phone was largely dependent on lighting conditions to produce good results. The default camera app offers various modes, including Portrait, Square, Panorama, and Manual. The manual mode essentially allows users to adjust the white balance and ISO levels to help them click pictures as per their liking.The Portrait mode, as you might have guessed, allows the handset to click pictures with a focus on the subject and blur the background to achieve a bokeh effect. Notably, this feature is available with both the front and rear camera setups. In our testing, the portrait mode did not produce particularly impressive results but someone who is looking for this feature at a pocket-friendly price, this is a welcome addition. You can also click pictures in HDR mode, with the option provided right up front in the camera app. At the front, you get a 5MP sensor with f/2.2 aperture lens and 1.12um pixels size. The pictures taken by the front camera were not particularly impressive in indoor conditions but the phone manages to take decent images outdoors.
     see in the samples shared above, the images clicked by the Redmi 6 in low-light conditions had considerable noise and grain. Keeping in mind that we are talking about an affordable segment phone, we can give this particular aspect a pass.  Xiaomi Redmi 6 runs Android 8.1 Oreo-based MIUI 9.6 out of the box. If you are familiar with the company’s mobile software interface, you would find yourself just at home with the new handset. There are utility tools and some pre-installed apps but the platform comes across fairly clutter-free and without much bloatware.  For security, apart from the fingerprint sensor, the handset provides a face unlock feature. We found this feature to be really quick to function. Additionally, the face unlock is also reliable as it does not unlock the handset if your eyes are closed. There are some other features like Full screen display and Second Space, which allow you to make use of gestures for associated functionalities and provide separate space for privacy, respectively. The smartphone is powered by a Helio P22 SoC, coupled with 3GB of RAM and either 32GB or 64GB of built-in storage. We did not face any issues with the performance offered by the Redmi 6 and there were no lags or hiccups navigating through the platform. Light apps and games were handled well by the smartphone but demanding games like PUBG and Injustice 2 posed difficulties for the Redmi 6, even at the lowest graphics settings.  We are usually impressed by the battery backup offered by the Xiaomi smartphones in general and the Redmi 6 continues this positive trend. Despite packing a not-so-massive 3,000mAh battery, the handset managed to last around 16 hours in our HD video loop test. However, it took us around three hours to charge the phone from zero to 100 percent.   For those who are constantly on the go and fear running out of charge, the Redmi 6 can prove to be a worthy companion. In our daily use, we managed to go through a full day on a single charge with medium usage, but heavy users might have to find the charger before the end of the day.

2417,30,32967,,,2018-09-21,,32967,Prateek Pandey -,Xiaomi Redmi 6A review: a worthy upgrade,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-6a-review?pid=32967," “We put Xiaomi’s latest budget smartphone, the Redmi 6A, through its paces” The numbers don’t lie – budget-conscious buyers just cannot resist the siren call of Xiaomi’s Redmi series of smartphones. The company’s wallet-friendly offerings have sold in the millions and recently, the brand announced two more devices to take the tally up even further. Dubbed the Redmi 6 (first impressions) and the Redmi 6A, the smartphones come as successors to last year’s Redmi 5 and Redmi 5A, albeit with one important difference. After a really long time, Xiaomi has decided to opt for a MediaTek chip instead of Qualcomm’s trusty ol’ Snapdragon 400-series.  Now, when I reviewed the Redmi 5A last year, I was immensely pleased with the smartphone’s competitive pricing, and one could snag one up for as low as Rs 3,999. So then, is the pricier Redmi 6A worth the extra bucks you spend on it? Well, that’s what I’m here to find out. Stay with me. Design-wise, Xiaomi seemingly went back to the drawing board as the Redmi 6A looks drastically different from its predecessor, the 5A. The handset now features more prominent curves towards the back, which don’t just enhance the smartphone’s overall looks but also pave way for excellent one-handed usage too. During my testing, I noticed that the smartphone nestled comfortably in my palms and owing to the presence of chamfered edges and rounded corners, the phone didn’t bite even when I gripped it tightly.  Flip the smartphone and you’ll find noticeable changes in the display department too. Unlike last year’s model, the Redmi 6A has gotten the bezel-less treatment and the smartphone ships with a tall, narrow frame with an aspect ratio of 18:9. Therefore, not only do buyers get a bigger 5.45-inch IPS display with the smartphone, but there’s a slight bump in the resolution as well. While the Redmi 5A’s display shipped boasted HD resolution, the 6A’s panel ships with HD+ resolution, which means you’ll get more pixels along the smartphone’s vertical edge.  That said, the pixel density of the 6A’s display remains the same as its predecessor and consequently, the overall sharpness of the panel remains unchanged too. Regardless, the Redmi 6A offers a much better media consumption experience, solely because of its bigger display which is ideal for enjoying movies and videos. Unfortunately, much like last year’s model, the Redmi 6A also lacks a fingerprint sensor. However, the company more than makes up for it by shipping the smartphone with a face unlock feature. Now, before you scoff at the idea of face recognition on a budget smartphone, hear me out. Not only did the Redmi 6A recognise my face in a jiffy, but I couldn’t fool the smartphone by using my portraits either. What’s more, unlike some other budget-oriented smartphones, I couldn’t unlock the Redmi 6A with my eyes closed. All in all, I had no problems relying on the Redmi 6A’s facial recognition to secure my personal files and data.   The Xiaomi Redmi 6A draws parallels to its predecessor in the camera department. Similar to last year’s model, the Redmi 6A also features solitary 13MP and 5MP shooters on the back and the front respectively. Consequently, you’ll be hard-pressed to tell if an image has been shot from the Redmi 5A or the Redmi 6A, just by looking at it with the naked eye. However, if you put the images under the microscope, then you’ll notice that the Redmi 6A has a slightly better dynamic range as it captures more details in the shadows. All in all, for the price you pay for the smartphone, the Redmi 6A’s rear camera will not disappoint you. 
    The quality of selfies you’ll get with the Redmi 6A isn’t all that different from the 5A either. Under ideal lighting scenarios, you might be able to get away with a decent looking picture, but upon zooming in, you’ll find noticeable softening and grain in the pictures. What’s more, despite not sporting a dual-camera setup on the front, the handset will let you snap a portrait selfie. Unfortunately, the ‘blur effect’ isn’t as smooth as I’d like it to be and there’s noticeable softening around the subject’s edges when the pictures are clicked using the portrait modeXiaomi has done more than just give the Redmi 6A a cosmetic overhaul, mind you. Underneath the smartphone’s plastic chassis, you’ll now get a brand-new, entry-level, 12nm processor from MediaTek, dubbed the Helio A22 chip. The processor features four physical cores which can turbo up to 2GHz and the company claims that the chip is almost 37 percent faster and 48 percent more battery-efficient than the Snapdragon 425 processor powering last year’s Redmi 5A. My review unit of the smartphone shipped with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of built-in, user-expandable storage, but buyers can also pick the device in a 2GB / 32GB configuration as well.  Now, as far as the performance is concerned, I was quite content with the Redmi 6A. I’ll have to hand it to Xiaomi here as the smartphone didn’t stutter or lag all that much, despite shipping with 2GB of RAM. The UI animations felt fluid and the smartphone didn’t struggle when I was multitasking between CPU-intensive applications like Google Chrome and Apple Music either. You’ll obviously find faults with the processor if you push it too hard but for casual smartphone users, the Redmi 6A offers little-to-no compromises in the performance department.  As for gaming, the smartphone managed to run light games like Clash Royale, Hoppenhelm and Ping Pong King without breaking a sweat. Sure, the games do take a while to load but its smooth sailing once they’re in the memory. I even managed to run PUBG on the smartphone and got a few kills, albeit at the lowest graphics settings. That said, the game was far from playable and I was experiencing a lot of frame drops during intense battles. Therefore, I’d recommend buyers avoid running intensive games on the smartphone as they’ll probably crack open the smartphone in frustration. Software-wise, the Xiaomi Redmi 6A boots Android Oreo v8.0 with MIUI v9 on top. In contrast, the Redmi 5A booted Android Nougat from the get-go. Now, if this isn’t your first rodeo with a Xiaomi smartphone, then you’ll know what to expect from the software – in-depth customisation features, support for gestures and the ability to run two versions of the same application. That being said, my favourite utility bundled with the software is the ‘second-space’ feature, which basically lets you install different sets of apps and add different accounts on the same smartphone. Think, separate users for Windows ported to Android.    Despite being fuelled by a relatively small 3,000mAh battery, the Xiaomi Redmi 6A managed to see me through the end of a busy day easily. My usage included some light gaming, listening to music on Apple Music, browsing social media apps like Instagram and Twitter and, texting my friends on WhatsApp. Despite pushing the smartphone’s battery to its limits, I managed to come back home with around 20 percent juice still left in the tank.  The Xiaomi Redmi 6A brings a host of improvements which make it a solid upgrade over its predecessor. For its asking price of Rs 5,999 for the 16GB storage model, the handset offers solid performance, good battery life, and a stylish design. You can go for the higher-end model as well, though that only offers twice the storage without increasing the RAM capacity, unlike earlier.   In terms of the competition, the Redmi 6A seems to have a clear advantage against the likes of the Infinix Smart 2 (first impressions) and 10.or D2 (first impressions).  Now, Xiaomi has numerous smartphones priced under Rs 10K and for every Rs 1,000 increment in your budget, you can get a slightly better smartphone than the Redmi 6A. All said and done, if you don’t have a flexible budget and have your sights set on the smartphone, then the Redmi 6A will not disappoint you."

2426,30,30121,,,2018-02-14,,30121,Nitansh Rastogi -,Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 review: old wine in a bezel-less bottle,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-note-5-review?pid=30121," For the past two years, Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 4 has ranked number one in 91mobiles’ list of the most popular phones in the country. In fact, both the Redmi Note 3 and Note 4 (review) were awarded the budget phone of the year title in 2016 and 2017 respectively. And there’s no denying that the Redmi series has played an instrumental role in making Xiaomi the number one smartphone manufacturer in India in Q4 2017. And now that 2018 is here, the Chinese giant is introducing the latest smartphone in the range – the Redmi Note 5. As noted in our first impressions, the newest offering from the brand has big shoes to fill, as it not only has to carry the legacy forward but also has to ward off increasing competition in the segment. Perhaps that’s why Xiaomi adopted a two-pronged strategy this time, by launching the Redmi Note 5 and Redmi Note 5 Pro together. While the former was unveiled in its home market back in December 2017 as the Redmi 5 Plus and brought a bezel-less display for the first time in the series, the latter is a global launch in the subcontinent and brings enviable specs such as dual cameras and up to 6GB RAM.  While we’ll be talking about the Redmi Note 5 Pro separately, it’s now time to take a deep dive into the spiritual successor of the company’s best-selling smartphone in India – the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5. The Redmi Note 5 seems to be the perfect example of “don’t fix it, if it ain’t broke” mantra. While the smartphone joins the modern trend of bezel-free displays, its spec sheet is largely identical to its predecessor. That means that you get the same innards, a similar camera setup and similar battery capacity. In a spec-obsessed market like India, that’s certainly a risky strategy. But based on our experience with the smartphone for about a week, we believe it has paid off. Here’s why we think so. Xiaomi was the first mainstream brand to make bezel-less displays a reality with the Mi Mix, and now it’s bringing them to the budget category. Having said that, the company hasn’t played around with the design much. The Redmi Note 5 just seems to be an elongated Redmi Note 3 or Redmi Note 4 with lower width. The Note 5 also is slimmer at 8.1mm as compared to 8.5mm waist of its predecessor. And while it seems to have added 15g weight to tip the scales at 180g, the weight has been well-distributed across the body. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 flaunts a tall 18:9 display up front, with minimal bezels on the top and bottom. One difference between the previous Redmi Note smartphones and the Redmi Note 5 is the fact that the latter ditches capacitive buttons for virtual navigation keys. Otherwise, the placement of ports and controls remains same as its previous iteration. Sadly, that means that the device continues with the micro-USB port for charging and data transfers, which doesn’t seem to be future-ready as more and more phones are offering bi-directional USB Type-C ports.While the design of the Redmi Note 5’s might seem unoriginal in today’s time, it certainly is solid. The metal-clad unibody construction also lends it class. Our review unit comes in an all-black hue, but the handset will also be available in gold, rose gold and Lake Blue options. The rear panel houses the primary camera at the centre in the top, with an LED flash and a fingerprint sensor below. Sadly, the back has a smooth finish and becomes quite slippery when the palms are sweaty.Thanks to the ultra-wide aspect ratio, the Note 5 display panel measures 6-inches diagonally (5.99-inches, to be precise). The IPS screen bears a resolution of 1,080 x 2,160 pixels, which results in crisp text and images. The colour reproduction is also accurate and eye-pleasing, and we didn’t find any issues in using it outdoors. It’s being protected by an unspecified layer of Corning Gorilla Glass.  While Android has reached version 8, Xiaomi’s proprietary skin MIUI continues to be a step ahead (quite literally) at v9. However, it runs atop the previous edition of Android, i.e. 7.1 Nougat. MIUI is one of the most refined Android-based platforms out there, offering a slew of features on top of Google’s OS, while keeping the interface clutter-free. You get a unified homescreen and app drawer, and customised icons. The latest version of MIUI brings a lot of changes behind-the-scenes, such as better app launch times, dynamic resource allocation, cache management, etc. And it totally lives up to its lightning fast tagline. It surely seems to be smoother and more refined than the previous iterations of Xiaomi’s proprietary UI. Earlier available for the Mi Max 2 (review), the newest version of MIUI also offers split-screen functionality, allowing you to open two apps together in perfect squares, thanks to 18:9 aspect ratio. In terms of visual changes, the biggest inclusion is the left-most screen in the homescreen. Dubbed App Vault, it offers app shortcuts, lets you book an Ola cab directly, displays calendar events, among other things – kind of a cross between OnePlus’ Shelf feature and YU’s Around screen. There are hardly any preloaded apps on the smartphone, except for Amazon, Hungama and WPS Office.    While the Redmi Note 4 offered a 13MP camera, its successor sports a 12MP camera. However, it has bigger pixels (1.25μm vs 1.12μm), but a smaller aperture of f/2.2 (as compared f/2.0 aperture). It’s supplemented by a dual-tone LED flash to assist in low-light conditions. At the front, the phone features an 8MP selfie camera. The camera interface is simple, with just the basic options up front, and the remaining modes hidden under options. These include usual modes such as panorama and manual (you can only tweak ISO and exposure, however), as well as scene detection, tilt-shift, etc  Coming to the camera performance, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 locks the focus on the subject quickly thanks to PDAF. Although, the shutter speed isn’t the best. Quality-wise, long shots offer an incredible level of details and images show natural colours. The HDR mode also proves to be quite effective and adds life to stills. In close-ups, the device manages to offer sharp results without any noise. Sadly, like most cameras, its Achilles’ heel is dim lighting, where it struggles badly. While the flash comes in handy in such situation, the pictures show a lot of grain. The same story continues in the selfie camera as well, though you get a flash at the front as well. Take a dekko at the camera samples of the Redmi Note 5.Check out the full-resolution camera samples of the Redmi Note 5 here . The videos shot by the Note 5 are quite good, if your hands are stable enough as it lacks any sort of stabilisation. Overall, the Redmi Note 5 offers a good camera setup. But it falls behind the rivals such as the Honor 9 Lite and 10.or G flaunt dual rear cameras (with the former having a pair of sensors at the front as well) offering interesting features such as depth-of-field effect. As aforementioned, the internals of the Redmi Note 5 are exactly same as its previous avatar. While the Snapdragon 625 is a reliable chipset which balances performance and battery efficiency quite well, it’s more than a year old and Qualcomm’s SD6xx series has already seen newer additions such as the SD630, SD6363 and SD660. As a matter of fact, the Note 5’s own sibling, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro draws power from Snapdragon 636 chipset. Having said that, during our use, the smartphone performed quite well, even while playing high-end games like Asphalt 8: Airborne and Hitman Sniper. The graphics were smooth and there were no frame drops either, though we did notice slight jitter here and there while racing in Asphalt 8. The good thing however, is the fact that the device maintains its cool even after long sessions of gaming, and using intensive tasks such as GPS.  Unlike the Redmi Note 4, the base variant of the Redmi Note 5 ships with 3GB of RAM, while the higher-end model features 4 gigs of RAM. We reviewed the latter, and were able to switch between multiple apps in a jiffy. Based on the RAM variant, the device will offer 32GB or 64GB of storage onboard. In our review unit, the smartphone had around 55GB of space left after accounting for OS and other resources.  Connectivity-wise, the smartphone offers support dual-SIM cards, with the secondary being a hybrid slot. The phone offers 4G VoLTE, Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi and GPS. One of the biggest highlights for the devices in the Redmi Note series is the battery life. The same remains the case with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5, which draws power from the 4,000mAh battery. Charged at 100 percent at 8 in the morning, it was easily able to continue till the next day even with the use of 4G, GPS, streaming podcasts, using camera along with around 30 minutes of voice calls. We were able to get around 5 hours of screen-on time, which is quite impressive. In the 91mobiles battery test, the phone played a 720p video on loop for more than 20 hours, with only cellular connectivity enabled, and both brightness and volume levels set at 50 percent.   Strangely enough, like previous offerings in the Redmi series, Xiaomi isn’t offering quick charge functionality with the Redmi Note 5. The device ships with a 2A charger, which takes a little over two hours to juice it up fully. If you already own a Redmi Note 4, there’s a little reason to upgrade to its forerunner unless you want a bezel-less form factor. But if you really want to change your phone, we’d suggest going for the Redmi Note 5 Pro, which offers better internals and dual cameras at a slightly higher price point. For others, like every Redmi smartphone, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 is a solid value-for-money offering with dependable performance, decent cameras and a great battery life – in a futuristic avatar with minimal bezels at the fascia. The 3GB RAM variant is priced the same as the last year’s base model – Rs 9,999, while the higher-end version will retail at Rs 11,999.  Unlike previous years however, Xiaomi’s Redmi Note series isn’t a trendsetter, and it’s actually trailing the competition. It’s toughest rival is the Honor 9 Lite (review), which not only brings a bezel-less display and a stand-out glass-sandwich design, but also offers a quad-camera setup. That said, Xiaomi’s latest scores in the battery department when compared to Honor’s offering. Another competitor is the 10.or G, which offers almost the same specs as the Redmi Note 5, but adds dual rear cameras to the mix.  All said and done, none of the competitors can match the brand equity that Xiaomi has built in such a short span of time, and if you are looking for a smartphone priced under Rs 12,000, the Redmi Note 5 is hard to ignore.

2240,30,30121,,,2018-02-14,,30121,Nitansh Rastogi -,Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 review: old wine in a bezel-less bottle,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-note-5-review?pid=30121," 30 million units shipped in 2018. Around 30 percent market share. The numero uno phonemaker in India for the past five quarters.
These aren’t some throwaway numbers, and the fact that a brand has been able to achieve them within just five years of its foray into the country, makes them all the more impressive.  Well, you must’ve guessed by now that I’m talking about Xiaomi, a brand which made its debut in India with the Mi 3 back in July 2014 – and hasn’t looked back ever since. And the series that has played an instrumental role in bringing the Apple of China – as it’s lovingly referred to – to such an enviable position is the Redmi Note range. Right from its inception, the devices in the lineup have brought powerful specs at mid-budget price points. With the Redmi Note 5 (review), the brand switched to the dual-device strategy as it launched the Redmi Note 5 Pro (review) alongside. But considering the rise in competition from players like ASUS and Honor, as well as from new-age companies like Realme, Xiaomi has gone ahead and launched the Redmi Note 6 Pro (first impressions) just nine months after the launch of the Note 5 Pro in the subcontinent. On paper, the device seems to be a spitting image of its predecessor, so you must be wondering what exactly the latest offering brings to the table. Well, that’s what I’m here to tell you, so let’s begin.  
Xiaomi’s Redmi Note series isn’t known for its design language, and the Note 6 Pro doesn’t try to change that fact either. The Note 5 duo joined the bezel-less bandwagon, and its successor goes a step further (if you consider a higher screen-to-body ratio, and not from the uniform design standpoint) by opting for a notch display.  And as pointed out in our first impressions, the result seems to be a mishmash of the Redmi Note 5 Pro and Redmi 6 Pro. As compared to its predecessor, the Redmi Note 6 Pro features a curvier back, which makes it easier to hold and you get a larger display in almost the same footprint. While the handset isn’t really slim at 8.3mm, the curved edges make it seem quite sleek. The phone also seems to have distributed its 182g weight well, and doesn’t seem bulky. Another interesting thing is that Xiaomi has listened to our prayers, and utilised a P2i nano-coating to make the Note 6 Pro splash resistant. While our review unit comes in black, you can also opt for the rose gold, blue or red hues.   Pictured here: Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro vs Redmi Note 5 Pro  
In terms of controls, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro sticks to the convention, almost to a fault. That’s because, it continues with a micro-USB port for charging and data transfers, which is odd considering Type-C is quickly becoming the norm. Flip to the back, and you’ll find a similar protruding dual-camera setup as the Note 5 Pro, 6 Pro (review) and Y2 (review). There’s a fingerprint scanner as well, which works like a charm, though you might need to use it less often than you might expect, all thanks to the face unlock functionality. While there’s no dedicated setup for face authentication, the feature works well, though it isn’t the fastest we’ve come across. Face unlock also struggles in low light and doesn’t work when you have sunglasses on.Display-wise, the Note 6 Pro ships with a 6.24-inch notch-toting screen with full HD+ resolution and 19:9 aspect ratio. The IPS panel offers punchy colours with ample brightness levels. For protection against scratches and minor nicks, the screen is protected by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass. Like most phones that come with a display notch, you can disable the cut-out from settings. Sadly however, I feel that Xiaomi could’ve tried to keep the cut-out narrower than it is (even though the brand might not be following the trend of waterdrop notches), as currently, it’s sizeable and hard to miss. You can tweak the screen contrast and set it to automatic, increased or standard, and tweak colours between default, warm and cool, from the settings menu. If I had to name one USP of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, it’s probably the dual-camera setups on the rear as well as the front – making it the first phone from the brand’s stables to flaunt four shooters. However, in terms of the specs, there isn’t much of a difference from the Redmi Note 5 Pro. At the back, you get 12-megapixel snapper paired with a 5MP depth-sensing unit. Look beyond resolution though, and you’ll notice that the primary camera now has a bigger pixel size of 1.4µm (vs 1.25µm) and wider aperture of f/1.9 (vs f/2.2). For selfies, the handset sports a 20MP sensor along with a 2MP camera. Both pair of shooters offer the portrait mode. To lock the focus quickly on the subject, the device also comes with dual-pixel autofocus technology, which works quite well.   
In terms of the camera interface, the viewfinder is quite minimal with a large circular shutter button sandwiched between the preview screen and front camera toggle at the bottom in the portrait orientation. Above it, you’ll find various modes such as video, portrait, panorama and manual. Up top, you’ll find the toggles for flash, HDR and AI mode along with various real-time colour effects and more options such as a timer, group selfie, etc. Speaking of artificial intelligence in the camera, the phone also comes with AI Portrait 2.0 and AI Scene Detection that can detect up to 32 scenes (the feature can identify up to 12 scenes for the selfie shooter), with the brand claiming that five of them are specifically customised for the country.  o is the Redmi Note 6 Pro the best camera phone you could find under Rs 15k? Well, I’d certainly say so. Images taken in daylight have an impressive dynamic range with punchy colours and a high level of detail as well. And if you enable the HDR mode, then the results look even better. Thanks to the bigger aperture and pixel size, the device manages to impress in dim environments too. Pictures taken during low light have a minimal amount of noise and offer good details as well. The portrait mode is also quite effective and does a good job in separating the subject from the background. While it’s not perfect – as sometimes the edges aren’t separated well enough – but it’s surely among the best depth effects we’ve come across in this category. As far as selfies are concerned, the 20MP shooter works quite well to offer great results with vibrant colours, although they aren’t as sharp as I’d have liked them to be. The 2MP depth sensor however, is much better than the software-based bokeh effect as it offers really impressive portrait selfies. As they say a picture is worth a thousand words, take a dekko at the camera samples of the Note 6 Pro Now you must’ve noticed that I haven’t talked about the AI mode of Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 6 Pro. Well, that’s because, it seems more of a gimmick at this point. Not only does it work in very few scenarios (like only being able to recognise buildings or clouds), but also doesn’t make a meaningful difference to the end result. Here’s a comparison between the normal and AI mode.   Note 6 Pro goes up directly against the Realme 2 Pro, and in terms of imaging, the former fares better against the 16MP primary snapper of the latter. The Xiaomi handset is able to reproduce vivid colours and slightly better details too, both in well-lit situations as well as low lighting.   In comparison to the Mi A2 as well, the pictures taken by the Note 6 Pro look more pleasing to the eyes. However, the A2 will have an advantage in poorly-lit conditions thanks to its super-pixel technology.                 With regards to videos, the Note 6 Pro can capture 1080p videos that are quite good and smooth as well, thanks to the EIS (electronic image stabilisation). And if you’re bummed that there’s no 4k support, then fret not, you just need to download a third-party camera app to get that capability.  
If you were wondering how exactly the Note 6 Pro is similar to its previous iteration, then this section is what you’re looking for. Under the hood, the 6th-gen Note handset is fuelled by the Snapdragon 636 chipset, which is paired with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM. The combination has proved to be quite solid ever since the Redmi Note 5 Pro became the first phone in the subcontinent to come with the SD636 chip (in February this year). Sadly however, a lot seems to have changed in this duration. Not only can you find more powerful SoCs in this segment now, but mobile gaming has found new legs in the form of PUBG. So it’s certainly odd to see that the device can only play the game in low graphics settings, considering we’ve seen the SD636 being able to run it in medium settings on other phones. If you want to know how good the performance in real-life is, then it’s worth noting that it’s extremely smooth. You’ll rarely come across any lag, and multitasking is swift as well.  
That’s also because the phone boots MIUI 10, which is well optimised. The custom Android platform does run on top of the older iteration of Android, i.e. 8.1 Oreo, but it does come with a lot of features and customisations that should appeal to both newbies and power users alike. Perhaps my only grouse would be the fact that Xiaomi prompts the user to install a lot of third-party apps (apart from preloaded apps like Facebook and Opera Mini). Not to forget that the brand has been accused of pushing ads even on system settings, though I haven’t noticed that on my unit as of yet. Then there’s duplication of apps that we’ve pointed out in case of Samsung phones earlier. You get four browsers on the phone, the default one, Google Chrome, UC Browser and Opera Mini – and that’s not all. For some reason, when you open a link, the Note 6 Pro doesn’t even offer the option to open it in Chrome.    Taking care of storage is 64GB of memory onboard, which offers around 52GB space out of the box. You can of course, expand it further with the use of a microSD card. However, that means that you’ll need to forego the secondary SIM slot. While the phone offers the usual connectivity options, one feature that deserves a shout-out is Wi-Fi passthrough. This basically lets you turn the phone into a hotspot, with the phone getting its connectivity from a Wi-Fi network. In simpler terms, you can share the same Wi-Fi network that the Redmi Note 6 Pro is connected to, with other devices as well. While this feature may not be useful in regular day-to-day usage, it could turn out to be really handy in certain scenarios – in hotels that impose a limit on the number of devices connecting to the in-room Wi-Fi for example.   
The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro continues the long-standing legacy of the series by offering an impressive battery life. The device packs in a 4,000mAh battery, which can last almost two days off a single charge. As per our battery tests, the phone lasted a whopping 21 hours while playing an HD video on loop with only the cellular network on and both the brightness and volume levels set at 50 percent. The device supports Quick Charge 3.0, but sadly, there’s no fast charger bundled with the phone. It takes around an hour and a half to juice up the phone with the supplied 2A adapter. 
If you’ve been following the review till now, it’s evident that Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 6 Pro is a solid smartphone with no real shortcoming as such. Even if you consider it an iterative upgrade, you just get a better package for the same asking price of Rs 13,999 (the higher-end 6GB RAM variant will set you back by Rs 15,999). My contention isn’t whether the handset is good or not, but the fact that buying a Xiaomi phone isn’t an eyes-closed decision anymore. While earlier, the offerings from the Apple of China were easily the best recommendations across segments, that no longer seems to be true. Let’s take a look at the competition for the Redmi Note 6 Pro closely: Without a doubt, the Realme 2 Pro (review) is among the most powerful devices priced below Rs 15,000, thanks to the Snapdragon 660 chipset, dual rear cameras, up to 8GB RAM and a 3,500mAh battery. The base variant of the Realme handset is priced exactly the same as the Redmi Note 6 Pro, and also seems to be a better buy for those who clamour for power.  
The newly-launched 8X (first impressions) is also a solid offering in this segment as it offers one of the largest displays (6.5-inches) and features a 12nm Kirin 710 SoC. Couple that with a strong 3,750mAh battery and an attractive design, and the Note 6 Pro doesn’t seem as alluring anymore. 
In my opinion, the Note 6 Pro will face a lot of competition from its own sibling as well. Not only is the Mi A2 (review) a part of Android One, but also draws power from a superior Snapdragon 660 SoC, even though it’s priced Rs 2k higher than the base variant of the Redmi Note 6 Pro. That said, if battery life is important, then its 3,000mAh cell won’t stand a chance against 4,000mAh pack of the Redmi Note 6 Pro. 
Of course, I can go on and on to include the likes of the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 (review), Motorola One Power (review) and more, but it’s clear that Xiaomi’s offering isn’t the only option to go for in this category. You could also choose to wait for the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2, which is expected to land in the country soon.  
That’s not to say that you shouldn’t buy the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, unless of course, you are using the Note 5 Pro already. If you’re looking for a solid all-rounder on a budget, then Xiaomi’s latest should definitely be among your consideration set, though it might not be at the very top anymore. However, if you buy the Note 6 Pro during the Black Friday sale (Rs 12,999 for the 4GB RAM model, and Rs 14,999 for the 6GB RAM version), then you can really get more bang for your buck.

While there’s no dedicated setup for face authentication, the feature works well, though it isn’t the fastest we’ve come across. Face unlock also struggles in low light and doesn’t work when you have sunglasses on.Display-wise, the Note 6 Pro ships with a 6.24-inch notch-toting screen with full HD+ resolution and 19:9 aspect ratio. The IPS panel offers punchy colours with ample brightness levels. For protection against scratches and minor nicks, the screen is protected by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass. Like most phones that come with a display notch, you can disable the cut-out from settings. Sadly however, I feel that Xiaomi could’ve tried to keep the cut-out narrower than it is (even though the brand might not be following the trend of waterdrop notches), as currently, it’s sizeable and hard to miss. You can tweak the screen contrast and set it to automatic, increased or standard, and tweak colours between default, warm and cool, from the settings menu. If I had to name one USP of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, it’s probably the dual-camera setups on the rear as well as the front – making it the first phone from the brand’s stables to flaunt four shooters. However, in terms of the specs, there isn’t much of a difference from the Redmi Note 5 Pro. At the back, you get 12-megapixel snapper paired with a 5MP depth-sensing unit. Look beyond resolution though, and you’ll notice that the primary camera now has a bigger pixel size of 1.4µm (vs 1.25µm) and wider aperture of f/1.9 (vs f/2.2). For selfies, the handset sports a 20MP sensor along with a 2MP camera. Both pair of shooters offer the portrait mode. To lock the focus quickly on the subject, the device also comes with dual-pixel autofocus technology, which works quite well.   
In terms of the camera interface, the viewfinder is quite minimal with a large circular shutter button sandwiched between the preview screen and front camera toggle at the bottom in the portrait orientation. Above it, you’ll find various modes such as video, portrait, panorama and manual. Up top, you’ll find the toggles for flash, HDR and AI mode along with various real-time colour effects and more options such as a timer, group selfie, etc. Speaking of artificial intelligence in the camera, the phone also comes with AI Portrait 2.0 and AI Scene Detection that can detect up to 32 scenes (the feature can identify up to 12 scenes for the selfie shooter), with the brand claiming that five of them are specifically customised for the country.  o is the Redmi Note 6 Pro the best camera phone you could find under Rs 15k? Well, I’d certainly say so. Images taken in daylight have an impressive dynamic range with punchy colours and a high level of detail as well. And if you enable the HDR mode, then the results look even better. Thanks to the bigger aperture and pixel size, the device manages to impress in dim environments too. Pictures taken during low light have a minimal amount of noise and offer good details as well. The portrait mode is also quite effective and does a good job in separating the subject from the background. While it’s not perfect – as sometimes the edges aren’t separated well enough – but it’s surely among the best depth effects we’ve come across in this category. As far as selfies are concerned, the 20MP shooter works quite well to offer great results with vibrant colours, although they aren’t as sharp as I’d have liked them to be. The 2MP depth sensor however, is much better than the software-based bokeh effect as it offers really impressive portrait selfies. As they say a picture is worth a thousand words, take a dekko at the camera samples of the Note 6 Pro Now you must’ve noticed that I haven’t talked about the AI mode of Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 6 Pro. Well, that’s because, it seems more of a gimmick at this point. Not only does it work in very few scenarios (like only being able to recognise buildings or clouds), but also doesn’t make a meaningful difference to the end result. Here’s a comparison between the normal and AI mode.   Note 6 Pro goes up directly against the Realme 2 Pro, and in terms of imaging, the former fares better against the 16MP primary snapper of the latter. The Xiaomi handset is able to reproduce vivid colours and slightly better details too, both in well-lit situations as well as low lighting.   In comparison to the Mi A2 as well, the pictures taken by the Note 6 Pro look more pleasing to the eyes. However, the A2 will have an advantage in poorly-lit conditions thanks to its super-pixel technology.                 With regards to videos, the Note 6 Pro can capture 1080p videos that are quite good and smooth as well, thanks to the EIS (electronic image stabilisation). And if you’re bummed that there’s no 4k support, then fret not, you just need to download a third-party camera app to get that capability.  
If you were wondering how exactly the Note 6 Pro is similar to its previous iteration, then this section is what you’re looking for. Under the hood, the 6th-gen Note handset is fuelled by the Snapdragon 636 chipset, which is paired with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM. The combination has proved to be quite solid ever since the Redmi Note 5 Pro became the first phone in the subcontinent to come with the SD636 chip (in February this year). Sadly however, a lot seems to have changed in this duration. Not only can you find more powerful SoCs in this segment now, but mobile gaming has found new legs in the form of PUBG. So it’s certainly odd to see that the device can only play the game in low graphics settings, considering we’ve seen the SD636 being able to run it in medium settings on other phones. If you want to know how good the performance in real-life is, then it’s worth noting that it’s extremely smooth. You’ll rarely come across any lag, and multitasking is swift as well.  
That’s also because the phone boots MIUI 10, which is well optimised. The custom Android platform does run on top of the older iteration of Android, i.e. 8.1 Oreo, but it does come with a lot of features and customisations that should appeal to both newbies and power users alike. Perhaps my only grouse would be the fact that Xiaomi prompts the user to install a lot of third-party apps (apart from preloaded apps like Facebook and Opera Mini). Not to forget that the brand has been accused of pushing ads even on system settings, though I haven’t noticed that on my unit as of yet. Then there’s duplication of apps that we’ve pointed out in case of Samsung phones earlier. You get four browsers on the phone, the default one, Google Chrome, UC Browser and Opera Mini – and that’s not all. For some reason, when you open a link, the Note 6 Pro doesn’t even offer the option to open it in Chrome.    Taking care of storage is 64GB of memory onboard, which offers around 52GB space out of the box. You can of course, expand it further with the use of a microSD card. However, that means that you’ll need to forego the secondary SIM slot. While the phone offers the usual connectivity options, one feature that deserves a shout-out is Wi-Fi passthrough. This basically lets you turn the phone into a hotspot, with the phone getting its connectivity from a Wi-Fi network. In simpler terms, you can share the same Wi-Fi network that the Redmi Note 6 Pro is connected to, with other devices as well. While this feature may not be useful in regular day-to-day usage, it could turn out to be really handy in certain scenarios – in hotels that impose a limit on the number of devices connecting to the in-room Wi-Fi for example.   
The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro continues the long-standing legacy of the series by offering an impressive battery life. The device packs in a 4,000mAh battery, which can last almost two days off a single charge. As per our battery tests, the phone lasted a whopping 21 hours while playing an HD video on loop with only the cellular network on and both the brightness and volume levels set at 50 percent. The device supports Quick Charge 3.0, but sadly, there’s no fast charger bundled with the phone. It takes around an hour and a half to juice up the phone with the supplied 2A adapter. 
If you’ve been following the review till now, it’s evident that Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 6 Pro is a solid smartphone with no real shortcoming as such. Even if you consider it an iterative upgrade, you just get a better package for the same asking price of Rs 13,999 (the higher-end 6GB RAM variant will set you back by Rs 15,999). My contention isn’t whether the handset is good or not, but the fact that buying a Xiaomi phone isn’t an eyes-closed decision anymore. While earlier, the offerings from the Apple of China were easily the best recommendations across segments, that no longer seems to be true. Let’s take a look at the competition for the Redmi Note 6 Pro closely: Without a doubt, the Realme 2 Pro (review) is among the most powerful devices priced below Rs 15,000, thanks to the Snapdragon 660 chipset, dual rear cameras, up to 8GB RAM and a 3,500mAh battery. The base variant of the Realme handset is priced exactly the same as the Redmi Note 6 Pro, and also seems to be a better buy for those who clamour for power.  
The newly-launched 8X (first impressions) is also a solid offering in this segment as it offers one of the largest displays (6.5-inches) and features a 12nm Kirin 710 SoC. Couple that with a strong 3,750mAh battery and an attractive design, and the Note 6 Pro doesn’t seem as alluring anymore. 
In my opinion, the Note 6 Pro will face a lot of competition from its own sibling as well. Not only is the Mi A2 (review) a part of Android One, but also draws power from a superior Snapdragon 660 SoC, even though it’s priced Rs 2k higher than the base variant of the Redmi Note 6 Pro. That said, if battery life is important, then its 3,000mAh cell won’t stand a chance against 4,000mAh pack of the Redmi Note 6 Pro. 
Of course, I can go on and on to include the likes of the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 (review), Motorola One Power (review) and more, but it’s clear that Xiaomi’s offering isn’t the only option to go for in this category. You could also choose to wait for the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2, which is expected to land in the country soon.  
That’s not to say that you shouldn’t buy the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, unless of course, you are using the Note 5 Pro already. If you’re looking for a solid all-rounder on a budget, then Xiaomi’s latest should definitely be among your consideration set, though it might not be at the very top anymore. However, if you buy the Note 6 Pro during the Black Friday sale (Rs 12,999 for the 4GB RAM model, and Rs 14,999 for the 6GB RAM version), then you can really get more bang for your buck.

2240,30,32195,,,2018-02-14,,32195,Nitansh Rastogi -,Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 review: old wine in a bezel-less bottle,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-note-5-review?pid=32195," 30 million units shipped in 2018. Around 30 percent market share. The numero uno phonemaker in India for the past five quarters.
These aren’t some throwaway numbers, and the fact that a brand has been able to achieve them within just five years of its foray into the country, makes them all the more impressive.  Well, you must’ve guessed by now that I’m talking about Xiaomi, a brand which made its debut in India with the Mi 3 back in July 2014 – and hasn’t looked back ever since. And the series that has played an instrumental role in bringing the Apple of China – as it’s lovingly referred to – to such an enviable position is the Redmi Note range. Right from its inception, the devices in the lineup have brought powerful specs at mid-budget price points. With the Redmi Note 5 (review), the brand switched to the dual-device strategy as it launched the Redmi Note 5 Pro (review) alongside. But considering the rise in competition from players like ASUS and Honor, as well as from new-age companies like Realme, Xiaomi has gone ahead and launched the Redmi Note 6 Pro (first impressions) just nine months after the launch of the Note 5 Pro in the subcontinent. On paper, the device seems to be a spitting image of its predecessor, so you must be wondering what exactly the latest offering brings to the table. Well, that’s what I’m here to tell you, so let’s begin.  
Xiaomi’s Redmi Note series isn’t known for its design language, and the Note 6 Pro doesn’t try to change that fact either. The Note 5 duo joined the bezel-less bandwagon, and its successor goes a step further (if you consider a higher screen-to-body ratio, and not from the uniform design standpoint) by opting for a notch display.  And as pointed out in our first impressions, the result seems to be a mishmash of the Redmi Note 5 Pro and Redmi 6 Pro. As compared to its predecessor, the Redmi Note 6 Pro features a curvier back, which makes it easier to hold and you get a larger display in almost the same footprint. While the handset isn’t really slim at 8.3mm, the curved edges make it seem quite sleek. The phone also seems to have distributed its 182g weight well, and doesn’t seem bulky. Another interesting thing is that Xiaomi has listened to our prayers, and utilised a P2i nano-coating to make the Note 6 Pro splash resistant. While our review unit comes in black, you can also opt for the rose gold, blue or red hues.   Pictured here: Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro vs Redmi Note 5 Pro  
In terms of controls, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro sticks to the convention, almost to a fault. That’s because, it continues with a micro-USB port for charging and data transfers, which is odd considering Type-C is quickly becoming the norm. Flip to the back, and you’ll find a similar protruding dual-camera setup as the Note 5 Pro, 6 Pro (review) and Y2 (review). There’s a fingerprint scanner as well, which works like a charm, though you might need to use it less often than you might expect, all thanks to the face unlock functionality.

As they say a picture is worth a thousand words, take a dekko at the camera samples of the Note 6 Pro Now you must’ve noticed that I haven’t talked about the AI mode of Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 6 Pro. Well, that’s because, it seems more of a gimmick at this point. Not only does it work in very few scenarios (like only being able to recognise buildings or clouds), but also doesn’t make a meaningful difference to the end result. Here’s a comparison between the normal and AI mode.   Note 6 Pro goes up directly against the Realme 2 Pro, and in terms of imaging, the former fares better against the 16MP primary snapper of the latter. The Xiaomi handset is able to reproduce vivid colours and slightly better details too, both in well-lit situations as well as low lighting.   In comparison to the Mi A2 as well, the pictures taken by the Note 6 Pro look more pleasing to the eyes. However, the A2 will have an advantage in poorly-lit conditions thanks to its super-pixel technology.                 With regards to videos, the Note 6 Pro can capture 1080p videos that are quite good and smooth as well, thanks to the EIS (electronic image stabilisation). And if you’re bummed that there’s no 4k support, then fret not, you just need to download a third-party camera app to get that capability.  
If you were wondering how exactly the Note 6 Pro is similar to its previous iteration, then this section is what you’re looking for. Under the hood, the 6th-gen Note handset is fuelled by the Snapdragon 636 chipset, which is paired with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM. The combination has proved to be quite solid ever since the Redmi Note 5 Pro became the first phone in the subcontinent to come with the SD636 chip (in February this year). Sadly however, a lot seems to have changed in this duration. Not only can you find more powerful SoCs in this segment now, but mobile gaming has found new legs in the form of PUBG. So it’s certainly odd to see that the device can only play the game in low graphics settings, considering we’ve seen the SD636 being able to run it in medium settings on other phones. If you want to know how good the performance in real-life is, then it’s worth noting that it’s extremely smooth. You’ll rarely come across any lag, and multitasking is swift as well.  
That’s also because the phone boots MIUI 10, which is well optimised. The custom Android platform does run on top of the older iteration of Android, i.e. 8.1 Oreo, but it does come with a lot of features and customisations that should appeal to both newbies and power users alike. Perhaps my only grouse would be the fact that Xiaomi prompts the user to install a lot of third-party apps (apart from preloaded apps like Facebook and Opera Mini). Not to forget that the brand has been accused of pushing ads even on system settings, though I haven’t noticed that on my unit as of yet. Then there’s duplication of apps that we’ve pointed out in case of Samsung phones earlier. You get four browsers on the phone, the default one, Google Chrome, UC Browser and Opera Mini – and that’s not all. For some reason, when you open a link, the Note 6 Pro doesn’t even offer the option to open it in Chrome.    Taking care of storage is 64GB of memory onboard, which offers around 52GB space out of the box. You can of course, expand it further with the use of a microSD card. However, that means that you’ll need to forego the secondary SIM slot. While the phone offers the usual connectivity options, one feature that deserves a shout-out is Wi-Fi passthrough. This basically lets you turn the phone into a hotspot, with the phone getting its connectivity from a Wi-Fi network. In simpler terms, you can share the same Wi-Fi network that the Redmi Note 6 Pro is connected to, with other devices as well. While this feature may not be useful in regular day-to-day usage, it could turn out to be really handy in certain scenarios – in hotels that impose a limit on the number of devices connecting to the in-room Wi-Fi for example.   
The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro continues the long-standing legacy of the series by offering an impressive battery life. The device packs in a 4,000mAh battery, which can last almost two days off a single charge. As per our battery tests, the phone lasted a whopping 21 hours while playing an HD video on loop with only the cellular network on and both the brightness and volume levels set at 50 percent. The device supports Quick Charge 3.0, but sadly, there’s no fast charger bundled with the phone. It takes around an hour and a half to juice up the phone with the supplied 2A adapter. 
If you’ve been following the review till now, it’s evident that Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 6 Pro is a solid smartphone with no real shortcoming as such. Even if you consider it an iterative upgrade, you just get a better package for the same asking price of Rs 13,999 (the higher-end 6GB RAM variant will set you back by Rs 15,999). My contention isn’t whether the handset is good or not, but the fact that buying a Xiaomi phone isn’t an eyes-closed decision anymore. While earlier, the offerings from the Apple of China were easily the best recommendations across segments, that no longer seems to be true. Let’s take a look at the competition for the Redmi Note 6 Pro closely: Without a doubt, the Realme 2 Pro (review) is among the most powerful devices priced below Rs 15,000, thanks to the Snapdragon 660 chipset, dual rear cameras, up to 8GB RAM and a 3,500mAh battery. The base variant of the Realme handset is priced exactly the same as the Redmi Note 6 Pro, and also seems to be a better buy for those who clamour for power.  
The newly-launched 8X (first impressions) is also a solid offering in this segment as it offers one of the largest displays (6.5-inches) and features a 12nm Kirin 710 SoC. Couple that with a strong 3,750mAh battery and an attractive design, and the Note 6 Pro doesn’t seem as alluring anymore. 
In my opinion, the Note 6 Pro will face a lot of competition from its own sibling as well. Not only is the Mi A2 (review) a part of Android One, but also draws power from a superior Snapdragon 660 SoC, even though it’s priced Rs 2k higher than the base variant of the Redmi Note 6 Pro. That said, if battery life is important, then its 3,000mAh cell won’t stand a chance against 4,000mAh pack of the Redmi Note 6 Pro. 
Of course, I can go on and on to include the likes of the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 (review), Motorola One Power (review) and more, but it’s clear that Xiaomi’s offering isn’t the only option to go for in this category. You could also choose to wait for the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2, which is expected to land in the country soon.  
That’s not to say that you shouldn’t buy the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, unless of course, you are using the Note 5 Pro already. If you’re looking for a solid all-rounder on a budget, then Xiaomi’s latest should definitely be among your consideration set, though it might not be at the very top anymore. However, if you buy the Note 6 Pro during the Black Friday sale (Rs 12,999 for the 4GB RAM model, and Rs 14,999 for the 6GB RAM version), then you can really get more bang for your buck.

2240,30,32195,,,2018-02-14,,32195,Nitansh Rastogi -,Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 review: old wine in a bezel-less bottle,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-note-5-review?pid=32195," 30 million units shipped in 2018. Around 30 percent market share. The numero uno phonemaker in India for the past five quarters.
These aren’t some throwaway numbers, and the fact that a brand has been able to achieve them within just five years of its foray into the country, makes them all the more impressive.  Well, you must’ve guessed by now that I’m talking about Xiaomi, a brand which made its debut in India with the Mi 3 back in July 2014 – and hasn’t looked back ever since. And the series that has played an instrumental role in bringing the Apple of China – as it’s lovingly referred to – to such an enviable position is the Redmi Note range. Right from its inception, the devices in the lineup have brought powerful specs at mid-budget price points. With the Redmi Note 5 (review), the brand switched to the dual-device strategy as it launched the Redmi Note 5 Pro (review) alongside. But considering the rise in competition from players like ASUS and Honor, as well as from new-age companies like Realme, Xiaomi has gone ahead and launched the Redmi Note 6 Pro (first impressions) just nine months after the launch of the Note 5 Pro in the subcontinent. On paper, the device seems to be a spitting image of its predecessor, so you must be wondering what exactly the latest offering brings to the table. Well, that’s what I’m here to tell you, so let’s begin.  
Xiaomi’s Redmi Note series isn’t known for its design language, and the Note 6 Pro doesn’t try to change that fact either. The Note 5 duo joined the bezel-less bandwagon, and its successor goes a step further (if you consider a higher screen-to-body ratio, and not from the uniform design standpoint) by opting for a notch display.  And as pointed out in our first impressions, the result seems to be a mishmash of the Redmi Note 5 Pro and Redmi 6 Pro. As compared to its predecessor, the Redmi Note 6 Pro features a curvier back, which makes it easier to hold and you get a larger display in almost the same footprint. While the handset isn’t really slim at 8.3mm, the curved edges make it seem quite sleek. The phone also seems to have distributed its 182g weight well, and doesn’t seem bulky. Another interesting thing is that Xiaomi has listened to our prayers, and utilised a P2i nano-coating to make the Note 6 Pro splash resistant. While our review unit comes in black, you can also opt for the rose gold, blue or red hues.   Pictured here: Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro vs Redmi Note 5 Pro  
In terms of controls, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro sticks to the convention, almost to a fault. That’s because, it continues with a micro-USB port for charging and data transfers, which is odd considering Type-C is quickly becoming the norm. Flip to the back, and you’ll find a similar protruding dual-camera setup as the Note 5 Pro, 6 Pro (review) and Y2 (review). There’s a fingerprint scanner as well, which works like a charm, though you might need to use it less often than you might expect, all thanks to the face unlock functionality. While there’s no dedicated setup for face authentication, the feature works well, though it isn’t the fastest we’ve come across. Face unlock also struggles in low light and doesn’t work when you have sunglasses on.Display-wise, the Note 6 Pro ships with a 6.24-inch notch-toting screen with full HD+ resolution and 19:9 aspect ratio. The IPS panel offers punchy colours with ample brightness levels. For protection against scratches and minor nicks, the screen is protected by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass. Like most phones that come with a display notch, you can disable the cut-out from settings. Sadly however, I feel that Xiaomi could’ve tried to keep the cut-out narrower than it is (even though the brand might not be following the trend of waterdrop notches), as currently, it’s sizeable and hard to miss. You can tweak the screen contrast and set it to automatic, increased or standard, and tweak colours between default, warm and cool, from the settings menu. If I had to name one USP of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, it’s probably the dual-camera setups on the rear as well as the front – making it the first phone from the brand’s stables to flaunt four shooters. However, in terms of the specs, there isn’t much of a difference from the Redmi Note 5 Pro. At the back, you get 12-megapixel snapper paired with a 5MP depth-sensing unit. Look beyond resolution though, and you’ll notice that the primary camera now has a bigger pixel size of 1.4µm (vs 1.25µm) and wider aperture of f/1.9 (vs f/2.2). For selfies, the handset sports a 20MP sensor along with a 2MP camera. Both pair of shooters offer the portrait mode. To lock the focus quickly on the subject, the device also comes with dual-pixel autofocus technology, which works quite well.   
In terms of the camera interface, the viewfinder is quite minimal with a large circular shutter button sandwiched between the preview screen and front camera toggle at the bottom in the portrait orientation. Above it, you’ll find various modes such as video, portrait, panorama and manual. Up top, you’ll find the toggles for flash, HDR and AI mode along with various real-time colour effects and more options such as a timer, group selfie, etc. Speaking of artificial intelligence in the camera, the phone also comes with AI Portrait 2.0 and AI Scene Detection that can detect up to 32 scenes (the feature can identify up to 12 scenes for the selfie shooter), with the brand claiming that five of them are specifically customised for the country.  o is the Redmi Note 6 Pro the best camera phone you could find under Rs 15k? Well, I’d certainly say so. Images taken in daylight have an impressive dynamic range with punchy colours and a high level of detail as well. And if you enable the HDR mode, then the results look even better. Thanks to the bigger aperture and pixel size, the device manages to impress in dim environments too. Pictures taken during low light have a minimal amount of noise and offer good details as well. The portrait mode is also quite effective and does a good job in separating the subject from the background. While it’s not perfect – as sometimes the edges aren’t separated well enough – but it’s surely among the best depth effects we’ve come across in this category. As far as selfies are concerned, the 20MP shooter works quite well to offer great results with vibrant colours, although they aren’t as sharp as I’d have liked them to be.

However, that means that you’ll need to forego the secondary SIM slot. While the phone offers the usual connectivity options, one feature that deserves a shout-out is Wi-Fi passthrough. This basically lets you turn the phone into a hotspot, with the phone getting its connectivity from a Wi-Fi network. In simpler terms, you can share the same Wi-Fi network that the Redmi Note 6 Pro is connected to, with other devices as well. While this feature may not be useful in regular day-to-day usage, it could turn out to be really handy in certain scenarios – in hotels that impose a limit on the number of devices connecting to the in-room Wi-Fi for example.   
The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro continues the long-standing legacy of the series by offering an impressive battery life. The device packs in a 4,000mAh battery, which can last almost two days off a single charge. As per our battery tests, the phone lasted a whopping 21 hours while playing an HD video on loop with only the cellular network on and both the brightness and volume levels set at 50 percent. The device supports Quick Charge 3.0, but sadly, there’s no fast charger bundled with the phone. It takes around an hour and a half to juice up the phone with the supplied 2A adapter. 
If you’ve been following the review till now, it’s evident that Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 6 Pro is a solid smartphone with no real shortcoming as such. Even if you consider it an iterative upgrade, you just get a better package for the same asking price of Rs 13,999 (the higher-end 6GB RAM variant will set you back by Rs 15,999). My contention isn’t whether the handset is good or not, but the fact that buying a Xiaomi phone isn’t an eyes-closed decision anymore. While earlier, the offerings from the Apple of China were easily the best recommendations across segments, that no longer seems to be true. Let’s take a look at the competition for the Redmi Note 6 Pro closely: Without a doubt, the Realme 2 Pro (review) is among the most powerful devices priced below Rs 15,000, thanks to the Snapdragon 660 chipset, dual rear cameras, up to 8GB RAM and a 3,500mAh battery. The base variant of the Realme handset is priced exactly the same as the Redmi Note 6 Pro, and also seems to be a better buy for those who clamour for power.  
The newly-launched 8X (first impressions) is also a solid offering in this segment as it offers one of the largest displays (6.5-inches) and features a 12nm Kirin 710 SoC. Couple that with a strong 3,750mAh battery and an attractive design, and the Note 6 Pro doesn’t seem as alluring anymore. 
In my opinion, the Note 6 Pro will face a lot of competition from its own sibling as well. Not only is the Mi A2 (review) a part of Android One, but also draws power from a superior Snapdragon 660 SoC, even though it’s priced Rs 2k higher than the base variant of the Redmi Note 6 Pro. That said, if battery life is important, then its 3,000mAh cell won’t stand a chance against 4,000mAh pack of the Redmi Note 6 Pro. 
Of course, I can go on and on to include the likes of the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 (review), Motorola One Power (review) and more, but it’s clear that Xiaomi’s offering isn’t the only option to go for in this category. You could also choose to wait for the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2, which is expected to land in the country soon.  
That’s not to say that you shouldn’t buy the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, unless of course, you are using the Note 5 Pro already. If you’re looking for a solid all-rounder on a budget, then Xiaomi’s latest should definitely be among your consideration set, though it might not be at the very top anymore. However, if you buy the Note 6 Pro during the Black Friday sale (Rs 12,999 for the 4GB RAM model, and Rs 14,999 for the 6GB RAM version), then you can really get more bang for your buck.

2240,30,32195,,,2018-02-14,,32195,Nitansh Rastogi -,Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 review: old wine in a bezel-less bottle,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-note-5-review?pid=32195," 30 million units shipped in 2018. Around 30 percent market share. The numero uno phonemaker in India for the past five quarters.
These aren’t some throwaway numbers, and the fact that a brand has been able to achieve them within just five years of its foray into the country, makes them all the more impressive.  Well, you must’ve guessed by now that I’m talking about Xiaomi, a brand which made its debut in India with the Mi 3 back in July 2014 – and hasn’t looked back ever since. And the series that has played an instrumental role in bringing the Apple of China – as it’s lovingly referred to – to such an enviable position is the Redmi Note range. Right from its inception, the devices in the lineup have brought powerful specs at mid-budget price points. With the Redmi Note 5 (review), the brand switched to the dual-device strategy as it launched the Redmi Note 5 Pro (review) alongside. But considering the rise in competition from players like ASUS and Honor, as well as from new-age companies like Realme, Xiaomi has gone ahead and launched the Redmi Note 6 Pro (first impressions) just nine months after the launch of the Note 5 Pro in the subcontinent. On paper, the device seems to be a spitting image of its predecessor, so you must be wondering what exactly the latest offering brings to the table. Well, that’s what I’m here to tell you, so let’s begin.  
Xiaomi’s Redmi Note series isn’t known for its design language, and the Note 6 Pro doesn’t try to change that fact either. The Note 5 duo joined the bezel-less bandwagon, and its successor goes a step further (if you consider a higher screen-to-body ratio, and not from the uniform design standpoint) by opting for a notch display.  And as pointed out in our first impressions, the result seems to be a mishmash of the Redmi Note 5 Pro and Redmi 6 Pro. As compared to its predecessor, the Redmi Note 6 Pro features a curvier back, which makes it easier to hold and you get a larger display in almost the same footprint. While the handset isn’t really slim at 8.3mm, the curved edges make it seem quite sleek. The phone also seems to have distributed its 182g weight well, and doesn’t seem bulky. Another interesting thing is that Xiaomi has listened to our prayers, and utilised a P2i nano-coating to make the Note 6 Pro splash resistant. While our review unit comes in black, you can also opt for the rose gold, blue or red hues.   Pictured here: Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro vs Redmi Note 5 Pro  
In terms of controls, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro sticks to the convention, almost to a fault. That’s because, it continues with a micro-USB port for charging and data transfers, which is odd considering Type-C is quickly becoming the norm. Flip to the back, and you’ll find a similar protruding dual-camera setup as the Note 5 Pro, 6 Pro (review) and Y2 (review). There’s a fingerprint scanner as well, which works like a charm, though you might need to use it less often than you might expect, all thanks to the face unlock functionality. While there’s no dedicated setup for face authentication, the feature works well, though it isn’t the fastest we’ve come across. Face unlock also struggles in low light and doesn’t work when you have sunglasses on.Display-wise, the Note 6 Pro ships with a 6.24-inch notch-toting screen with full HD+ resolution and 19:9 aspect ratio. The IPS panel offers punchy colours with ample brightness levels. For protection against scratches and minor nicks, the screen is protected by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass. Like most phones that come with a display notch, you can disable the cut-out from settings. Sadly however, I feel that Xiaomi could’ve tried to keep the cut-out narrower than it is (even though the brand might not be following the trend of waterdrop notches), as currently, it’s sizeable and hard to miss. You can tweak the screen contrast and set it to automatic, increased or standard, and tweak colours between default, warm and cool, from the settings menu. If I had to name one USP of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, it’s probably the dual-camera setups on the rear as well as the front – making it the first phone from the brand’s stables to flaunt four shooters. However, in terms of the specs, there isn’t much of a difference from the Redmi Note 5 Pro. At the back, you get 12-megapixel snapper paired with a 5MP depth-sensing unit. Look beyond resolution though, and you’ll notice that the primary camera now has a bigger pixel size of 1.4µm (vs 1.25µm) and wider aperture of f/1.9 (vs f/2.2). For selfies, the handset sports a 20MP sensor along with a 2MP camera. Both pair of shooters offer the portrait mode. To lock the focus quickly on the subject, the device also comes with dual-pixel autofocus technology, which works quite well.   
In terms of the camera interface, the viewfinder is quite minimal with a large circular shutter button sandwiched between the preview screen and front camera toggle at the bottom in the portrait orientation. Above it, you’ll find various modes such as video, portrait, panorama and manual. Up top, you’ll find the toggles for flash, HDR and AI mode along with various real-time colour effects and more options such as a timer, group selfie, etc. Speaking of artificial intelligence in the camera, the phone also comes with AI Portrait 2.0 and AI Scene Detection that can detect up to 32 scenes (the feature can identify up to 12 scenes for the selfie shooter), with the brand claiming that five of them are specifically customised for the country.  o is the Redmi Note 6 Pro the best camera phone you could find under Rs 15k? Well, I’d certainly say so. Images taken in daylight have an impressive dynamic range with punchy colours and a high level of detail as well. And if you enable the HDR mode, then the results look even better. Thanks to the bigger aperture and pixel size, the device manages to impress in dim environments too. Pictures taken during low light have a minimal amount of noise and offer good details as well. The portrait mode is also quite effective and does a good job in separating the subject from the background. While it’s not perfect – as sometimes the edges aren’t separated well enough – but it’s surely among the best depth effects we’ve come across in this category. As far as selfies are concerned, the 20MP shooter works quite well to offer great results with vibrant colours, although they aren’t as sharp as I’d have liked them to be. The 2MP depth sensor however, is much better than the software-based bokeh effect as it offers really impressive portrait selfies. As they say a picture is worth a thousand words, take a dekko at the camera samples of the Note 6 Pro Now you must’ve noticed that I haven’t talked about the AI mode of Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 6 Pro. Well, that’s because, it seems more of a gimmick at this point. Not only does it work in very few scenarios (like only being able to recognise buildings or clouds), but also doesn’t make a meaningful difference to the end result. Here’s a comparison between the normal and AI mode.   Note 6 Pro goes up directly against the Realme 2 Pro, and in terms of imaging, the former fares better against the 16MP primary snapper of the latter. The Xiaomi handset is able to reproduce vivid colours and slightly better details too, both in well-lit situations as well as low lighting.   In comparison to the Mi A2 as well, the pictures taken by the Note 6 Pro look more pleasing to the eyes. However, the A2 will have an advantage in poorly-lit conditions thanks to its super-pixel technology.                 With regards to videos, the Note 6 Pro can capture 1080p videos that are quite good and smooth as well, thanks to the EIS (electronic image stabilisation). And if you’re bummed that there’s no 4k support, then fret not, you just need to download a third-party camera app to get that capability.  
If you were wondering how exactly the Note 6 Pro is similar to its previous iteration, then this section is what you’re looking for. Under the hood, the 6th-gen Note handset is fuelled by the Snapdragon 636 chipset, which is paired with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM. The combination has proved to be quite solid ever since the Redmi Note 5 Pro became the first phone in the subcontinent to come with the SD636 chip (in February this year). Sadly however, a lot seems to have changed in this duration. Not only can you find more powerful SoCs in this segment now, but mobile gaming has found new legs in the form of PUBG. So it’s certainly odd to see that the device can only play the game in low graphics settings, considering we’ve seen the SD636 being able to run it in medium settings on other phones. If you want to know how good the performance in real-life is, then it’s worth noting that it’s extremely smooth. You’ll rarely come across any lag, and multitasking is swift as well.  
That’s also because the phone boots MIUI 10, which is well optimised. The custom Android platform does run on top of the older iteration of Android, i.e. 8.1 Oreo, but it does come with a lot of features and customisations that should appeal to both newbies and power users alike. Perhaps my only grouse would be the fact that Xiaomi prompts the user to install a lot of third-party apps (apart from preloaded apps like Facebook and Opera Mini). Not to forget that the brand has been accused of pushing ads even on system settings, though I haven’t noticed that on my unit as of yet. Then there’s duplication of apps that we’ve pointed out in case of Samsung phones earlier. You get four browsers on the phone, the default one, Google Chrome, UC Browser and Opera Mini – and that’s not all. For some reason, when you open a link, the Note 6 Pro doesn’t even offer the option to open it in Chrome.    Taking care of storage is 64GB of memory onboard, which offers around 52GB space out of the box. You can of course, expand it further with the use of a microSD card. However, that means that you’ll need to forego the secondary SIM slot. While the phone offers the usual connectivity options, one feature that deserves a shout-out is Wi-Fi passthrough.

2240,30,32195,,,2018-02-14,,32195,Nitansh Rastogi -,Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 review: old wine in a bezel-less bottle,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-note-5-review?pid=32195," For the past two years, Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 4 has ranked number one in 91mobiles’ list of the most popular phones in the country. In fact, both the Redmi Note 3 and Note 4 (review) were awarded the budget phone of the year title in 2016 and 2017 respectively. And there’s no denying that the Redmi series has played an instrumental role in making Xiaomi the number one smartphone manufacturer in India in Q4 2017. And now that 2018 is here, the Chinese giant is introducing the latest smartphone in the range – the Redmi Note 5. As noted in our first impressions, the newest offering from the brand has big shoes to fill, as it not only has to carry the legacy forward but also has to ward off increasing competition in the segment. Perhaps that’s why Xiaomi adopted a two-pronged strategy this time, by launching the Redmi Note 5 and Redmi Note 5 Pro together. While the former was unveiled in its home market back in December 2017 as the Redmi 5 Plus and brought a bezel-less display for the first time in the series, the latter is a global launch in the subcontinent and brings enviable specs such as dual cameras and up to 6GB RAM.  While we’ll be talking about the Redmi Note 5 Pro separately, it’s now time to take a deep dive into the spiritual successor of the company’s best-selling smartphone in India – the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5. The Redmi Note 5 seems to be the perfect example of “don’t fix it, if it ain’t broke” mantra. While the smartphone joins the modern trend of bezel-free displays, its spec sheet is largely identical to its predecessor. That means that you get the same innards, a similar camera setup and similar battery capacity. In a spec-obsessed market like India, that’s certainly a risky strategy. But based on our experience with the smartphone for about a week, we believe it has paid off. Here’s why we think so. Xiaomi was the first mainstream brand to make bezel-less displays a reality with the Mi Mix, and now it’s bringing them to the budget category. Having said that, the company hasn’t played around with the design much. The Redmi Note 5 just seems to be an elongated Redmi Note 3 or Redmi Note 4 with lower width. The Note 5 also is slimmer at 8.1mm as compared to 8.5mm waist of its predecessor. And while it seems to have added 15g weight to tip the scales at 180g, the weight has been well-distributed across the body. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 flaunts a tall 18:9 display up front, with minimal bezels on the top and bottom. One difference between the previous Redmi Note smartphones and the Redmi Note 5 is the fact that the latter ditches capacitive buttons for virtual navigation keys. Otherwise, the placement of ports and controls remains same as its previous iteration. Sadly, that means that the device continues with the micro-USB port for charging and data transfers, which doesn’t seem to be future-ready as more and more phones are offering bi-directional USB Type-C ports.  While the design of the Redmi Note 5’s might seem unoriginal in today’s time, it certainly is solid. The metal-clad unibody construction also lends it class. Our review unit comes in an all-black hue, but the handset will also be available in gold, rose gold and Lake Blue options. The rear panel houses the primary camera at the centre in the top, with an LED flash and a fingerprint sensor below. Sadly, the back has a smooth finish and becomes quite slippery when the palms are sweaty. Thanks to the ultra-wide aspect ratio, the Note 5 display panel measures 6-inches diagonally (5.99-inches, to be precise). The IPS screen bears a resolution of 1,080 x 2,160 pixels, which results in crisp text and images. The colour reproduction is also accurate and eye-pleasing, and we didn’t find any issues in using it outdoors. It’s being protected by an unspecified layer of Corning Gorilla Glass.  While Android has reached version 8, Xiaomi’s proprietary skin MIUI continues to be a step ahead (quite literally) at v9. However, it runs atop the previous edition of Android, i.e. 7.1 Nougat. MIUI is one of the most refined Android-based platforms out there, offering a slew of features on top of Google’s OS, while keeping the interface clutter-free. You get a unified homescreen and app drawer, and customised icons. The latest version of MIUI brings a lot of changes behind-the-scenes, such as better app launch times, dynamic resource allocation, cache management, etc. And it totally lives up to its lightning fast tagline. It surely seems to be smoother and more refined than the previous iterations of Xiaomi’s proprietary UI. Earlier available for the Mi Max 2 (review), the newest version of MIUI also offers split-screen functionality, allowing you to open two apps together in perfect squares, thanks to 18:9 aspect ratio.  In terms of visual changes, the biggest inclusion is the left-most screen in the homescreen. Dubbed App Vault, it offers app shortcuts, lets you book an Ola cab directly, displays calendar events, among other things – kind of a cross between OnePlus’ Shelf feature and YU’s Around screen. There are hardly any preloaded apps on the smartphone, except for Amazon, Hungama and WPS Office.    While the Redmi Note 4 offered a 13MP camera, its successor sports a 12MP camera. However, it has bigger pixels (1.25μm vs 1.12μm), but a smaller aperture of f/2.2 (as compared f/2.0 aperture). It’s supplemented by a dual-tone LED flash to assist in low-light conditions. At the front, the phone features an 8MP selfie camera. The camera interface is simple, with just the basic options up front, and the remaining modes hidden under options. These include usual modes such as panorama and manual (you can only tweak ISO and exposure, however), as well as scene detection, tilt-shift, etc. Coming to the camera performance, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 locks the focus on the subject quickly thanks to PDAF. Although, the shutter speed isn’t the best. Quality-wise, long shots offer an incredible level of details and images show natural colours. The HDR mode also proves to be quite effective and adds life to stills. In close-ups, the device manages to offer sharp results without any noise. Sadly, like most cameras, its Achilles’ heel is dim lighting, where it struggles badly. While the flash comes in handy in such situation, the pictures show a lot of grain. The same story continues in the selfie camera as well, though you get a flash at the front as well. Take a dekko at the camera samples of the Redmi Note 5.   Check out the full-resolution camera samples of the Redmi Note 5 here The videos shot by the Note 5 are quite good, if your hands are stable enough as it lacks any sort of stabilisation. Overall, the Redmi Note 5 offers a good camera setup. But it falls behind the rivals such as the Honor 9 Lite and 10.or G flaunt dual rear cameras (with the former having a pair of sensors at the front as well) offering interesting features such as depth-of-field effect. As aforementioned, the internals of the Redmi Note 5 are exactly same as its previous avatar. While the Snapdragon 625 is a reliable chipset which balances performance and battery efficiency quite well, it’s more than a year old and Qualcomm’s SD6xx series has already seen newer additions such as the SD630, SD6363 and SD660. As a matter of fact, the Note 5’s own sibling, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro draws power from Snapdragon 636 chipset. Having said that, during our use, the smartphone performed quite well, even while playing high-end games like Asphalt 8: Airborne and Hitman Sniper. The graphics were smooth and there were no frame drops either, though we did notice slight jitter here and there while racing in Asphalt 8. The good thing however, is the fact that the device maintains its cool even after long sessions of gaming, and using intensive tasks such as GPS.  Unlike the Redmi Note 4, the base variant of the Redmi Note 5 ships with 3GB of RAM, while the higher-end model features 4 gigs of RAM. We reviewed the latter, and were able to switch between multiple apps in a jiffy. Based on the RAM variant, the device will offer 32GB or 64GB of storage onboard. In our review unit, the smartphone had around 55GB of space left after accounting for OS and other resources.  Connectivity-wise, the smartphone offers support dual-SIM cards, with the secondary being a hybrid slot. The phone offers 4G VoLTE, Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi and GPS. One of the biggest highlights for the devices in the Redmi Note series is the battery life. The same remains the case with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5, which draws power from the 4,000mAh battery. Charged at 100 percent at 8 in the morning, it was easily able to continue till the next day even with the use of 4G, GPS, streaming podcasts, using camera along with around 30 minutes of voice calls. We were able to get around 5 hours of screen-on time, which is quite impressive. In the 91mobiles battery test, the phone played a 720p video on loop for more than 20 hours, with only cellular connectivity enabled, and both brightness and volume levels set at 50 percent.   Strangely enough, like previous offerings in the Redmi series, Xiaomi isn’t offering quick charge functionality with the Redmi Note 5. The device ships with a 2A charger, which takes a little over two hours to juice it up fully. If you already own a Redmi Note 4, there’s a little reason to upgrade to its forerunner unless you want a bezel-less form factor. But if you really want to change your phone, we’d suggest going for the Redmi Note 5 Pro, which offers better internals and dual cameras at a slightly higher price point. For others, like every Redmi smartphone, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 is a solid value-for-money offering with dependable performance, decent cameras and a great battery life – in a futuristic avatar with minimal bezels at the fascia. The 3GB RAM variant is priced the same as the last year’s base model – Rs 9,999, while the higher-end version will retail at Rs 11,999.  Unlike previous years however, Xiaomi’s Redmi Note series isn’t a trendsetter, and it’s actually trailing the competition. It’s toughest rival is the Honor 9 Lite (review), which not only brings a bezel-less display and a stand-out glass-sandwich design, but also offers a quad-camera setup. That said, Xiaomi’s latest scores in the battery department when compared to Honor’s offering. Another competitor is the 10.or G, which offers almost the same specs as the Redmi Note 5, but adds dual rear cameras to the mix.  All said and done, none of the competitors can match the brand equity that Xiaomi has built in such a short span of time, and if you are looking for a smartphone priced under Rs 12,000, the Redmi Note 5 is hard to ignore.

While our review unit comes in black, you can also opt for the rose gold, blue or red hues.   Pictured here: Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro vs Redmi Note 5 Pro  
In terms of controls, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro sticks to the convention, almost to a fault. That’s because, it continues with a micro-USB port for charging and data transfers, which is odd considering Type-C is quickly becoming the norm. Flip to the back, and you’ll find a similar protruding dual-camera setup as the Note 5 Pro, 6 Pro (review) and Y2 (review). There’s a fingerprint scanner as well, which works like a charm, though you might need to use it less often than you might expect, all thanks to the face unlock functionality. While there’s no dedicated setup for face authentication, the feature works well, though it isn’t the fastest we’ve come across. Face unlock also struggles in low light and doesn’t work when you have sunglasses on.Display-wise, the Note 6 Pro ships with a 6.24-inch notch-toting screen with full HD+ resolution and 19:9 aspect ratio. The IPS panel offers punchy colours with ample brightness levels. For protection against scratches and minor nicks, the screen is protected by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass. Like most phones that come with a display notch, you can disable the cut-out from settings. Sadly however, I feel that Xiaomi could’ve tried to keep the cut-out narrower than it is (even though the brand might not be following the trend of waterdrop notches), as currently, it’s sizeable and hard to miss. You can tweak the screen contrast and set it to automatic, increased or standard, and tweak colours between default, warm and cool, from the settings menu. If I had to name one USP of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, it’s probably the dual-camera setups on the rear as well as the front – making it the first phone from the brand’s stables to flaunt four shooters. However, in terms of the specs, there isn’t much of a difference from the Redmi Note 5 Pro. At the back, you get 12-megapixel snapper paired with a 5MP depth-sensing unit. Look beyond resolution though, and you’ll notice that the primary camera now has a bigger pixel size of 1.4µm (vs 1.25µm) and wider aperture of f/1.9 (vs f/2.2). For selfies, the handset sports a 20MP sensor along with a 2MP camera. Both pair of shooters offer the portrait mode. To lock the focus quickly on the subject, the device also comes with dual-pixel autofocus technology, which works quite well.   
In terms of the camera interface, the viewfinder is quite minimal with a large circular shutter button sandwiched between the preview screen and front camera toggle at the bottom in the portrait orientation. Above it, you’ll find various modes such as video, portrait, panorama and manual. Up top, you’ll find the toggles for flash, HDR and AI mode along with various real-time colour effects and more options such as a timer, group selfie, etc. Speaking of artificial intelligence in the camera, the phone also comes with AI Portrait 2.0 and AI Scene Detection that can detect up to 32 scenes (the feature can identify up to 12 scenes for the selfie shooter), with the brand claiming that five of them are specifically customised for the country.  o is the Redmi Note 6 Pro the best camera phone you could find under Rs 15k? Well, I’d certainly say so. Images taken in daylight have an impressive dynamic range with punchy colours and a high level of detail as well. And if you enable the HDR mode, then the results look even better. Thanks to the bigger aperture and pixel size, the device manages to impress in dim environments too. Pictures taken during low light have a minimal amount of noise and offer good details as well. The portrait mode is also quite effective and does a good job in separating the subject from the background. While it’s not perfect – as sometimes the edges aren’t separated well enough – but it’s surely among the best depth effects we’ve come across in this category. As far as selfies are concerned, the 20MP shooter works quite well to offer great results with vibrant colours, although they aren’t as sharp as I’d have liked them to be. The 2MP depth sensor however, is much better than the software-based bokeh effect as it offers really impressive portrait selfies. As they say a picture is worth a thousand words, take a dekko at the camera samples of the Note 6 Pro Now you must’ve noticed that I haven’t talked about the AI mode of Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 6 Pro. Well, that’s because, it seems more of a gimmick at this point. Not only does it work in very few scenarios (like only being able to recognise buildings or clouds), but also doesn’t make a meaningful difference to the end result. Here’s a comparison between the normal and AI mode.   Note 6 Pro goes up directly against the Realme 2 Pro, and in terms of imaging, the former fares better against the 16MP primary snapper of the latter. The Xiaomi handset is able to reproduce vivid colours and slightly better details too, both in well-lit situations as well as low lighting.   In comparison to the Mi A2 as well, the pictures taken by the Note 6 Pro look more pleasing to the eyes. However, the A2 will have an advantage in poorly-lit conditions thanks to its super-pixel technology.                 With regards to videos, the Note 6 Pro can capture 1080p videos that are quite good and smooth as well, thanks to the EIS (electronic image stabilisation). And if you’re bummed that there’s no 4k support, then fret not, you just need to download a third-party camera app to get that capability.  
If you were wondering how exactly the Note 6 Pro is similar to its previous iteration, then this section is what you’re looking for. Under the hood, the 6th-gen Note handset is fuelled by the Snapdragon 636 chipset, which is paired with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM. The combination has proved to be quite solid ever since the Redmi Note 5 Pro became the first phone in the subcontinent to come with the SD636 chip (in February this year). Sadly however, a lot seems to have changed in this duration. Not only can you find more powerful SoCs in this segment now, but mobile gaming has found new legs in the form of PUBG. So it’s certainly odd to see that the device can only play the game in low graphics settings, considering we’ve seen the SD636 being able to run it in medium settings on other phones. If you want to know how good the performance in real-life is, then it’s worth noting that it’s extremely smooth. You’ll rarely come across any lag, and multitasking is swift as well.  
That’s also because the phone boots MIUI 10, which is well optimised. The custom Android platform does run on top of the older iteration of Android, i.e. 8.1 Oreo, but it does come with a lot of features and customisations that should appeal to both newbies and power users alike. Perhaps my only grouse would be the fact that Xiaomi prompts the user to install a lot of third-party apps (apart from preloaded apps like Facebook and Opera Mini). Not to forget that the brand has been accused of pushing ads even on system settings, though I haven’t noticed that on my unit as of yet. Then there’s duplication of apps that we’ve pointed out in case of Samsung phones earlier. You get four browsers on the phone, the default one, Google Chrome, UC Browser and Opera Mini – and that’s not all. For some reason, when you open a link, the Note 6 Pro doesn’t even offer the option to open it in Chrome.    Taking care of storage is 64GB of memory onboard, which offers around 52GB space out of the box. You can of course, expand it further with the use of a microSD card. However, that means that you’ll need to forego the secondary SIM slot. While the phone offers the usual connectivity options, one feature that deserves a shout-out is Wi-Fi passthrough. This basically lets you turn the phone into a hotspot, with the phone getting its connectivity from a Wi-Fi network. In simpler terms, you can share the same Wi-Fi network that the Redmi Note 6 Pro is connected to, with other devices as well. While this feature may not be useful in regular day-to-day usage, it could turn out to be really handy in certain scenarios – in hotels that impose a limit on the number of devices connecting to the in-room Wi-Fi for example.   
The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro continues the long-standing legacy of the series by offering an impressive battery life. The device packs in a 4,000mAh battery, which can last almost two days off a single charge. As per our battery tests, the phone lasted a whopping 21 hours while playing an HD video on loop with only the cellular network on and both the brightness and volume levels set at 50 percent. The device supports Quick Charge 3.0, but sadly, there’s no fast charger bundled with the phone. It takes around an hour and a half to juice up the phone with the supplied 2A adapter. 
If you’ve been following the review till now, it’s evident that Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 6 Pro is a solid smartphone with no real shortcoming as such. Even if you consider it an iterative upgrade, you just get a better package for the same asking price of Rs 13,999 (the higher-end 6GB RAM variant will set you back by Rs 15,999). My contention isn’t whether the handset is good or not, but the fact that buying a Xiaomi phone isn’t an eyes-closed decision anymore. While earlier, the offerings from the Apple of China were easily the best recommendations across segments, that no longer seems to be true. Let’s take a look at the competition for the Redmi Note 6 Pro closely: Without a doubt, the Realme 2 Pro (review) is among the most powerful devices priced below Rs 15,000, thanks to the Snapdragon 660 chipset, dual rear cameras, up to 8GB RAM and a 3,500mAh battery. The base variant of the Realme handset is priced exactly the same as the Redmi Note 6 Pro, and also seems to be a better buy for those who clamour for power.  
The newly-launched 8X (first impressions) is also a solid offering in this segment as it offers one of the largest displays (6.5-inches) and features a 12nm Kirin 710 SoC. Couple that with a strong 3,750mAh battery and an attractive design, and the Note 6 Pro doesn’t seem as alluring anymore. 
In my opinion, the Note 6 Pro will face a lot of competition from its own sibling as well. Not only is the Mi A2 (review) a part of Android One, but also draws power from a superior Snapdragon 660 SoC, even though it’s priced Rs 2k higher than the base variant of the Redmi Note 6 Pro. That said, if battery life is important, then its 3,000mAh cell won’t stand a chance against 4,000mAh pack of the Redmi Note 6 Pro. 
Of course, I can go on and on to include the likes of the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 (review), Motorola One Power (review) and more, but it’s clear that Xiaomi’s offering isn’t the only option to go for in this category. You could also choose to wait for the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2, which is expected to land in the country soon.  
That’s not to say that you shouldn’t buy the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, unless of course, you are using the Note 5 Pro already. If you’re looking for a solid all-rounder on a budget, then Xiaomi’s latest should definitely be among your consideration set, though it might not be at the very top anymore. However, if you buy the Note 6 Pro during the Black Friday sale (Rs 12,999 for the 4GB RAM model, and Rs 14,999 for the 6GB RAM version), then you can really get more bang for your buck.

2235,30,32954,4,5,2018-11-22,,32954,Nitansh Rastogi -,Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro review: an iterative upgrade that makes one of the best budget smartphones even better,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-note-6-pro-review?pid=32954," 30 million units shipped in 2018. Around 30 percent market share. The numero uno phonemaker in India for the past five quarters.
These aren’t some throwaway numbers, and the fact that a brand has been able to achieve them within just five years of its foray into the country, makes them all the more impressive.  Well, you must’ve guessed by now that I’m talking about Xiaomi, a brand which made its debut in India with the Mi 3 back in July 2014 – and hasn’t looked back ever since. And the series that has played an instrumental role in bringing the Apple of China – as it’s lovingly referred to – to such an enviable position is the Redmi Note range. Right from its inception, the devices in the lineup have brought powerful specs at mid-budget price points. With the Redmi Note 5 (review), the brand switched to the dual-device strategy as it launched the Redmi Note 5 Pro (review) alongside. But considering the rise in competition from players like ASUS and Honor, as well as from new-age companies like Realme, Xiaomi has gone ahead and launched the Redmi Note 6 Pro (first impressions) just nine months after the launch of the Note 5 Pro in the subcontinent. On paper, the device seems to be a spitting image of its predecessor, so you must be wondering what exactly the latest offering brings to the table. Well, that’s what I’m here to tell you, so let’s begin.  
Xiaomi’s Redmi Note series isn’t known for its design language, and the Note 6 Pro doesn’t try to change that fact either. The Note 5 duo joined the bezel-less bandwagon, and its successor goes a step further (if you consider a higher screen-to-body ratio, and not from the uniform design standpoint) by opting for a notch display.  And as pointed out in our first impressions, the result seems to be a mishmash of the Redmi Note 5 Pro and Redmi 6 Pro. As compared to its predecessor, the Redmi Note 6 Pro features a curvier back, which makes it easier to hold and you get a larger display in almost the same footprint. While the handset isn’t really slim at 8.3mm, the curved edges make it seem quite sleek. The phone also seems to have distributed its 182g weight well, and doesn’t seem bulky. Another interesting thing is that Xiaomi has listened to our prayers, and utilised a P2i nano-coating to make the Note 6 Pro splash resistant.

Well, I’d certainly say so. Images taken in daylight have an impressive dynamic range with punchy colours and a high level of detail as well. And if you enable the HDR mode, then the results look even better. Thanks to the bigger aperture and pixel size, the device manages to impress in dim environments too. Pictures taken during low light have a minimal amount of noise and offer good details as well. The portrait mode is also quite effective and does a good job in separating the subject from the background. While it’s not perfect – as sometimes the edges aren’t separated well enough – but it’s surely among the best depth effects we’ve come across in this category. As far as selfies are concerned, the 20MP shooter works quite well to offer great results with vibrant colours, although they aren’t as sharp as I’d have liked them to be. The 2MP depth sensor however, is much better than the software-based bokeh effect as it offers really impressive portrait selfies. As they say a picture is worth a thousand words, take a dekko at the camera samples of the Note 6 Pro Now you must’ve noticed that I haven’t talked about the AI mode of Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 6 Pro. Well, that’s because, it seems more of a gimmick at this point. Not only does it work in very few scenarios (like only being able to recognise buildings or clouds), but also doesn’t make a meaningful difference to the end result. Here’s a comparison between the normal and AI mode.   Note 6 Pro goes up directly against the Realme 2 Pro, and in terms of imaging, the former fares better against the 16MP primary snapper of the latter. The Xiaomi handset is able to reproduce vivid colours and slightly better details too, both in well-lit situations as well as low lighting.   In comparison to the Mi A2 as well, the pictures taken by the Note 6 Pro look more pleasing to the eyes. However, the A2 will have an advantage in poorly-lit conditions thanks to its super-pixel technology.                 With regards to videos, the Note 6 Pro can capture 1080p videos that are quite good and smooth as well, thanks to the EIS (electronic image stabilisation). And if you’re bummed that there’s no 4k support, then fret not, you just need to download a third-party camera app to get that capability.  
If you were wondering how exactly the Note 6 Pro is similar to its previous iteration, then this section is what you’re looking for. Under the hood, the 6th-gen Note handset is fuelled by the Snapdragon 636 chipset, which is paired with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM. The combination has proved to be quite solid ever since the Redmi Note 5 Pro became the first phone in the subcontinent to come with the SD636 chip (in February this year). Sadly however, a lot seems to have changed in this duration. Not only can you find more powerful SoCs in this segment now, but mobile gaming has found new legs in the form of PUBG. So it’s certainly odd to see that the device can only play the game in low graphics settings, considering we’ve seen the SD636 being able to run it in medium settings on other phones. If you want to know how good the performance in real-life is, then it’s worth noting that it’s extremely smooth. You’ll rarely come across any lag, and multitasking is swift as well.  
That’s also because the phone boots MIUI 10, which is well optimised. The custom Android platform does run on top of the older iteration of Android, i.e. 8.1 Oreo, but it does come with a lot of features and customisations that should appeal to both newbies and power users alike. Perhaps my only grouse would be the fact that Xiaomi prompts the user to install a lot of third-party apps (apart from preloaded apps like Facebook and Opera Mini). Not to forget that the brand has been accused of pushing ads even on system settings, though I haven’t noticed that on my unit as of yet. Then there’s duplication of apps that we’ve pointed out in case of Samsung phones earlier. You get four browsers on the phone, the default one, Google Chrome, UC Browser and Opera Mini – and that’s not all. For some reason, when you open a link, the Note 6 Pro doesn’t even offer the option to open it in Chrome.    Taking care of storage is 64GB of memory onboard, which offers around 52GB space out of the box. You can of course, expand it further with the use of a microSD card. However, that means that you’ll need to forego the secondary SIM slot. While the phone offers the usual connectivity options, one feature that deserves a shout-out is Wi-Fi passthrough. This basically lets you turn the phone into a hotspot, with the phone getting its connectivity from a Wi-Fi network. In simpler terms, you can share the same Wi-Fi network that the Redmi Note 6 Pro is connected to, with other devices as well. While this feature may not be useful in regular day-to-day usage, it could turn out to be really handy in certain scenarios – in hotels that impose a limit on the number of devices connecting to the in-room Wi-Fi for example.   
The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro continues the long-standing legacy of the series by offering an impressive battery life. The device packs in a 4,000mAh battery, which can last almost two days off a single charge. As per our battery tests, the phone lasted a whopping 21 hours while playing an HD video on loop with only the cellular network on and both the brightness and volume levels set at 50 percent. The device supports Quick Charge 3.0, but sadly, there’s no fast charger bundled with the phone. It takes around an hour and a half to juice up the phone with the supplied 2A adapter. 
If you’ve been following the review till now, it’s evident that Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 6 Pro is a solid smartphone with no real shortcoming as such. Even if you consider it an iterative upgrade, you just get a better package for the same asking price of Rs 13,999 (the higher-end 6GB RAM variant will set you back by Rs 15,999). My contention isn’t whether the handset is good or not, but the fact that buying a Xiaomi phone isn’t an eyes-closed decision anymore. While earlier, the offerings from the Apple of China were easily the best recommendations across segments, that no longer seems to be true. Let’s take a look at the competition for the Redmi Note 6 Pro closely: Without a doubt, the Realme 2 Pro (review) is among the most powerful devices priced below Rs 15,000, thanks to the Snapdragon 660 chipset, dual rear cameras, up to 8GB RAM and a 3,500mAh battery. The base variant of the Realme handset is priced exactly the same as the Redmi Note 6 Pro, and also seems to be a better buy for those who clamour for power.  
The newly-launched 8X (first impressions) is also a solid offering in this segment as it offers one of the largest displays (6.5-inches) and features a 12nm Kirin 710 SoC. Couple that with a strong 3,750mAh battery and an attractive design, and the Note 6 Pro doesn’t seem as alluring anymore. 
In my opinion, the Note 6 Pro will face a lot of competition from its own sibling as well. Not only is the Mi A2 (review) a part of Android One, but also draws power from a superior Snapdragon 660 SoC, even though it’s priced Rs 2k higher than the base variant of the Redmi Note 6 Pro. That said, if battery life is important, then its 3,000mAh cell won’t stand a chance against 4,000mAh pack of the Redmi Note 6 Pro. 
Of course, I can go on and on to include the likes of the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 (review), Motorola One Power (review) and more, but it’s clear that Xiaomi’s offering isn’t the only option to go for in this category. You could also choose to wait for the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2, which is expected to land in the country soon.  
That’s not to say that you shouldn’t buy the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, unless of course, you are using the Note 5 Pro already. If you’re looking for a solid all-rounder on a budget, then Xiaomi’s latest should definitely be among your consideration set, though it might not be at the very top anymore. However, if you buy the Note 6 Pro during the Black Friday sale (Rs 12,999 for the 4GB RAM model, and Rs 14,999 for the 6GB RAM version), then you can really get more bang for your buck.

2235,30,32954,4,5,2018-11-22,,32954,Nitansh Rastogi -,Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro review: an iterative upgrade that makes one of the best budget smartphones even better,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-note-6-pro-review?pid=32954," 30 million units shipped in 2018. Around 30 percent market share. The numero uno phonemaker in India for the past five quarters.
These aren’t some throwaway numbers, and the fact that a brand has been able to achieve them within just five years of its foray into the country, makes them all the more impressive.  Well, you must’ve guessed by now that I’m talking about Xiaomi, a brand which made its debut in India with the Mi 3 back in July 2014 – and hasn’t looked back ever since. And the series that has played an instrumental role in bringing the Apple of China – as it’s lovingly referred to – to such an enviable position is the Redmi Note range. Right from its inception, the devices in the lineup have brought powerful specs at mid-budget price points. With the Redmi Note 5 (review), the brand switched to the dual-device strategy as it launched the Redmi Note 5 Pro (review) alongside. But considering the rise in competition from players like ASUS and Honor, as well as from new-age companies like Realme, Xiaomi has gone ahead and launched the Redmi Note 6 Pro (first impressions) just nine months after the launch of the Note 5 Pro in the subcontinent. On paper, the device seems to be a spitting image of its predecessor, so you must be wondering what exactly the latest offering brings to the table. Well, that’s what I’m here to tell you, so let’s begin.  
Xiaomi’s Redmi Note series isn’t known for its design language, and the Note 6 Pro doesn’t try to change that fact either. The Note 5 duo joined the bezel-less bandwagon, and its successor goes a step further (if you consider a higher screen-to-body ratio, and not from the uniform design standpoint) by opting for a notch display.  And as pointed out in our first impressions, the result seems to be a mishmash of the Redmi Note 5 Pro and Redmi 6 Pro. As compared to its predecessor, the Redmi Note 6 Pro features a curvier back, which makes it easier to hold and you get a larger display in almost the same footprint. While the handset isn’t really slim at 8.3mm, the curved edges make it seem quite sleek. The phone also seems to have distributed its 182g weight well, and doesn’t seem bulky. Another interesting thing is that Xiaomi has listened to our prayers, and utilised a P2i nano-coating to make the Note 6 Pro splash resistant. While our review unit comes in black, you can also opt for the rose gold, blue or red hues.   Pictured here: Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro vs Redmi Note 5 Pro  
In terms of controls, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro sticks to the convention, almost to a fault. That’s because, it continues with a micro-USB port for charging and data transfers, which is odd considering Type-C is quickly becoming the norm. Flip to the back, and you’ll find a similar protruding dual-camera setup as the Note 5 Pro, 6 Pro (review) and Y2 (review). There’s a fingerprint scanner as well, which works like a charm, though you might need to use it less often than you might expect, all thanks to the face unlock functionality. While there’s no dedicated setup for face authentication, the feature works well, though it isn’t the fastest we’ve come across. Face unlock also struggles in low light and doesn’t work when you have sunglasses on.Display-wise, the Note 6 Pro ships with a 6.24-inch notch-toting screen with full HD+ resolution and 19:9 aspect ratio. The IPS panel offers punchy colours with ample brightness levels. For protection against scratches and minor nicks, the screen is protected by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass. Like most phones that come with a display notch, you can disable the cut-out from settings. Sadly however, I feel that Xiaomi could’ve tried to keep the cut-out narrower than it is (even though the brand might not be following the trend of waterdrop notches), as currently, it’s sizeable and hard to miss. You can tweak the screen contrast and set it to automatic, increased or standard, and tweak colours between default, warm and cool, from the settings menu. If I had to name one USP of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, it’s probably the dual-camera setups on the rear as well as the front – making it the first phone from the brand’s stables to flaunt four shooters. However, in terms of the specs, there isn’t much of a difference from the Redmi Note 5 Pro. At the back, you get 12-megapixel snapper paired with a 5MP depth-sensing unit. Look beyond resolution though, and you’ll notice that the primary camera now has a bigger pixel size of 1.4µm (vs 1.25µm) and wider aperture of f/1.9 (vs f/2.2). For selfies, the handset sports a 20MP sensor along with a 2MP camera. Both pair of shooters offer the portrait mode. To lock the focus quickly on the subject, the device also comes with dual-pixel autofocus technology, which works quite well.   
In terms of the camera interface, the viewfinder is quite minimal with a large circular shutter button sandwiched between the preview screen and front camera toggle at the bottom in the portrait orientation. Above it, you’ll find various modes such as video, portrait, panorama and manual. Up top, you’ll find the toggles for flash, HDR and AI mode along with various real-time colour effects and more options such as a timer, group selfie, etc. Speaking of artificial intelligence in the camera, the phone also comes with AI Portrait 2.0 and AI Scene Detection that can detect up to 32 scenes (the feature can identify up to 12 scenes for the selfie shooter), with the brand claiming that five of them are specifically customised for the country.  o is the Redmi Note 6 Pro the best camera phone you could find under Rs 15k?

If you want to know how good the performance in real-life is, then it’s worth noting that it’s extremely smooth. You’ll rarely come across any lag, and multitasking is swift as well.  
That’s also because the phone boots MIUI 10, which is well optimised. The custom Android platform does run on top of the older iteration of Android, i.e. 8.1 Oreo, but it does come with a lot of features and customisations that should appeal to both newbies and power users alike. Perhaps my only grouse would be the fact that Xiaomi prompts the user to install a lot of third-party apps (apart from preloaded apps like Facebook and Opera Mini). Not to forget that the brand has been accused of pushing ads even on system settings, though I haven’t noticed that on my unit as of yet. Then there’s duplication of apps that we’ve pointed out in case of Samsung phones earlier. You get four browsers on the phone, the default one, Google Chrome, UC Browser and Opera Mini – and that’s not all. For some reason, when you open a link, the Note 6 Pro doesn’t even offer the option to open it in Chrome.    Taking care of storage is 64GB of memory onboard, which offers around 52GB space out of the box. You can of course, expand it further with the use of a microSD card. However, that means that you’ll need to forego the secondary SIM slot. While the phone offers the usual connectivity options, one feature that deserves a shout-out is Wi-Fi passthrough. This basically lets you turn the phone into a hotspot, with the phone getting its connectivity from a Wi-Fi network. In simpler terms, you can share the same Wi-Fi network that the Redmi Note 6 Pro is connected to, with other devices as well. While this feature may not be useful in regular day-to-day usage, it could turn out to be really handy in certain scenarios – in hotels that impose a limit on the number of devices connecting to the in-room Wi-Fi for example.   
The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro continues the long-standing legacy of the series by offering an impressive battery life. The device packs in a 4,000mAh battery, which can last almost two days off a single charge. As per our battery tests, the phone lasted a whopping 21 hours while playing an HD video on loop with only the cellular network on and both the brightness and volume levels set at 50 percent. The device supports Quick Charge 3.0, but sadly, there’s no fast charger bundled with the phone. It takes around an hour and a half to juice up the phone with the supplied 2A adapter. 
If you’ve been following the review till now, it’s evident that Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 6 Pro is a solid smartphone with no real shortcoming as such. Even if you consider it an iterative upgrade, you just get a better package for the same asking price of Rs 13,999 (the higher-end 6GB RAM variant will set you back by Rs 15,999). My contention isn’t whether the handset is good or not, but the fact that buying a Xiaomi phone isn’t an eyes-closed decision anymore. While earlier, the offerings from the Apple of China were easily the best recommendations across segments, that no longer seems to be true. Let’s take a look at the competition for the Redmi Note 6 Pro closely: Without a doubt, the Realme 2 Pro (review) is among the most powerful devices priced below Rs 15,000, thanks to the Snapdragon 660 chipset, dual rear cameras, up to 8GB RAM and a 3,500mAh battery. The base variant of the Realme handset is priced exactly the same as the Redmi Note 6 Pro, and also seems to be a better buy for those who clamour for power.  
The newly-launched 8X (first impressions) is also a solid offering in this segment as it offers one of the largest displays (6.5-inches) and features a 12nm Kirin 710 SoC. Couple that with a strong 3,750mAh battery and an attractive design, and the Note 6 Pro doesn’t seem as alluring anymore. 
In my opinion, the Note 6 Pro will face a lot of competition from its own sibling as well. Not only is the Mi A2 (review) a part of Android One, but also draws power from a superior Snapdragon 660 SoC, even though it’s priced Rs 2k higher than the base variant of the Redmi Note 6 Pro. That said, if battery life is important, then its 3,000mAh cell won’t stand a chance against 4,000mAh pack of the Redmi Note 6 Pro. 
Of course, I can go on and on to include the likes of the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 (review), Motorola One Power (review) and more, but it’s clear that Xiaomi’s offering isn’t the only option to go for in this category. You could also choose to wait for the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2, which is expected to land in the country soon.  
That’s not to say that you shouldn’t buy the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, unless of course, you are using the Note 5 Pro already. If you’re looking for a solid all-rounder on a budget, then Xiaomi’s latest should definitely be among your consideration set, though it might not be at the very top anymore. However, if you buy the Note 6 Pro during the Black Friday sale (Rs 12,999 for the 4GB RAM model, and Rs 14,999 for the 6GB RAM version), then you can really get more bang for your buck.

2235,30,32954,4,5,2018-11-22,,32954,Nitansh Rastogi -,Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro review: an iterative upgrade that makes one of the best budget smartphones even better,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-note-6-pro-review?pid=32954," 30 million units shipped in 2018. Around 30 percent market share. The numero uno phonemaker in India for the past five quarters.
These aren’t some throwaway numbers, and the fact that a brand has been able to achieve them within just five years of its foray into the country, makes them all the more impressive.  Well, you must’ve guessed by now that I’m talking about Xiaomi, a brand which made its debut in India with the Mi 3 back in July 2014 – and hasn’t looked back ever since. And the series that has played an instrumental role in bringing the Apple of China – as it’s lovingly referred to – to such an enviable position is the Redmi Note range. Right from its inception, the devices in the lineup have brought powerful specs at mid-budget price points. With the Redmi Note 5 (review), the brand switched to the dual-device strategy as it launched the Redmi Note 5 Pro (review) alongside. But considering the rise in competition from players like ASUS and Honor, as well as from new-age companies like Realme, Xiaomi has gone ahead and launched the Redmi Note 6 Pro (first impressions) just nine months after the launch of the Note 5 Pro in the subcontinent. On paper, the device seems to be a spitting image of its predecessor, so you must be wondering what exactly the latest offering brings to the table. Well, that’s what I’m here to tell you, so let’s begin.  
Xiaomi’s Redmi Note series isn’t known for its design language, and the Note 6 Pro doesn’t try to change that fact either. The Note 5 duo joined the bezel-less bandwagon, and its successor goes a step further (if you consider a higher screen-to-body ratio, and not from the uniform design standpoint) by opting for a notch display.  And as pointed out in our first impressions, the result seems to be a mishmash of the Redmi Note 5 Pro and Redmi 6 Pro. As compared to its predecessor, the Redmi Note 6 Pro features a curvier back, which makes it easier to hold and you get a larger display in almost the same footprint. While the handset isn’t really slim at 8.3mm, the curved edges make it seem quite sleek. The phone also seems to have distributed its 182g weight well, and doesn’t seem bulky. Another interesting thing is that Xiaomi has listened to our prayers, and utilised a P2i nano-coating to make the Note 6 Pro splash resistant. While our review unit comes in black, you can also opt for the rose gold, blue or red hues.   Pictured here: Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro vs Redmi Note 5 Pro  
In terms of controls, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro sticks to the convention, almost to a fault. That’s because, it continues with a micro-USB port for charging and data transfers, which is odd considering Type-C is quickly becoming the norm. Flip to the back, and you’ll find a similar protruding dual-camera setup as the Note 5 Pro, 6 Pro (review) and Y2 (review). There’s a fingerprint scanner as well, which works like a charm, though you might need to use it less often than you might expect, all thanks to the face unlock functionality. While there’s no dedicated setup for face authentication, the feature works well, though it isn’t the fastest we’ve come across. Face unlock also struggles in low light and doesn’t work when you have sunglasses on.Display-wise, the Note 6 Pro ships with a 6.24-inch notch-toting screen with full HD+ resolution and 19:9 aspect ratio. The IPS panel offers punchy colours with ample brightness levels. For protection against scratches and minor nicks, the screen is protected by a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass. Like most phones that come with a display notch, you can disable the cut-out from settings. Sadly however, I feel that Xiaomi could’ve tried to keep the cut-out narrower than it is (even though the brand might not be following the trend of waterdrop notches), as currently, it’s sizeable and hard to miss. You can tweak the screen contrast and set it to automatic, increased or standard, and tweak colours between default, warm and cool, from the settings menu. If I had to name one USP of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, it’s probably the dual-camera setups on the rear as well as the front – making it the first phone from the brand’s stables to flaunt four shooters. However, in terms of the specs, there isn’t much of a difference from the Redmi Note 5 Pro. At the back, you get 12-megapixel snapper paired with a 5MP depth-sensing unit. Look beyond resolution though, and you’ll notice that the primary camera now has a bigger pixel size of 1.4µm (vs 1.25µm) and wider aperture of f/1.9 (vs f/2.2). For selfies, the handset sports a 20MP sensor along with a 2MP camera. Both pair of shooters offer the portrait mode. To lock the focus quickly on the subject, the device also comes with dual-pixel autofocus technology, which works quite well.   
In terms of the camera interface, the viewfinder is quite minimal with a large circular shutter button sandwiched between the preview screen and front camera toggle at the bottom in the portrait orientation. Above it, you’ll find various modes such as video, portrait, panorama and manual. Up top, you’ll find the toggles for flash, HDR and AI mode along with various real-time colour effects and more options such as a timer, group selfie, etc. Speaking of artificial intelligence in the camera, the phone also comes with AI Portrait 2.0 and AI Scene Detection that can detect up to 32 scenes (the feature can identify up to 12 scenes for the selfie shooter), with the brand claiming that five of them are specifically customised for the country.  o is the Redmi Note 6 Pro the best camera phone you could find under Rs 15k? Well, I’d certainly say so. Images taken in daylight have an impressive dynamic range with punchy colours and a high level of detail as well. And if you enable the HDR mode, then the results look even better. Thanks to the bigger aperture and pixel size, the device manages to impress in dim environments too. Pictures taken during low light have a minimal amount of noise and offer good details as well. The portrait mode is also quite effective and does a good job in separating the subject from the background. While it’s not perfect – as sometimes the edges aren’t separated well enough – but it’s surely among the best depth effects we’ve come across in this category. As far as selfies are concerned, the 20MP shooter works quite well to offer great results with vibrant colours, although they aren’t as sharp as I’d have liked them to be. The 2MP depth sensor however, is much better than the software-based bokeh effect as it offers really impressive portrait selfies. As they say a picture is worth a thousand words, take a dekko at the camera samples of the Note 6 Pro Now you must’ve noticed that I haven’t talked about the AI mode of Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 6 Pro. Well, that’s because, it seems more of a gimmick at this point. Not only does it work in very few scenarios (like only being able to recognise buildings or clouds), but also doesn’t make a meaningful difference to the end result. Here’s a comparison between the normal and AI mode.   Note 6 Pro goes up directly against the Realme 2 Pro, and in terms of imaging, the former fares better against the 16MP primary snapper of the latter. The Xiaomi handset is able to reproduce vivid colours and slightly better details too, both in well-lit situations as well as low lighting.   In comparison to the Mi A2 as well, the pictures taken by the Note 6 Pro look more pleasing to the eyes. However, the A2 will have an advantage in poorly-lit conditions thanks to its super-pixel technology.                 With regards to videos, the Note 6 Pro can capture 1080p videos that are quite good and smooth as well, thanks to the EIS (electronic image stabilisation). And if you’re bummed that there’s no 4k support, then fret not, you just need to download a third-party camera app to get that capability.  
If you were wondering how exactly the Note 6 Pro is similar to its previous iteration, then this section is what you’re looking for. Under the hood, the 6th-gen Note handset is fuelled by the Snapdragon 636 chipset, which is paired with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM. The combination has proved to be quite solid ever since the Redmi Note 5 Pro became the first phone in the subcontinent to come with the SD636 chip (in February this year). Sadly however, a lot seems to have changed in this duration. Not only can you find more powerful SoCs in this segment now, but mobile gaming has found new legs in the form of PUBG. So it’s certainly odd to see that the device can only play the game in low graphics settings, considering we’ve seen the SD636 being able to run it in medium settings on other phones. If you want to know how good the performance in real-life is, then it’s worth noting that it’s extremely smooth. You’ll rarely come across any lag, and multitasking is swift as well.

2414,30,33386,,,2019-02-08,,33386,Prateek Pandey -,Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 review: well worth your money,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-note-7-review?pid=33386," “Our two cents on the most affordable smartphone that boasts a 48MP camera, the Redmi Note 7 If there’s one smartphone manufacturer which has had an enormous impact in the Indian smartphone market, it’s undoubtedly Xiaomi. The manufacturer has all but become a household name in the country by offering buyers compelling smartphones which don’t break the bank. That said, the company recently made headlines not for selling a stock of smartphones in a matter of seconds, but for announcing that it’s spinning off its popular Redmi series into a sub brand. And the very first offering from the new sub brand is the recently announced Redmi Note 7 (first impressions). The device seems to have created ripples, all thanks to its headlining 48MP camera and loaded specs, offered at a mouth-watering price. While the phone is yet to make its way to our shores, we imported a unit from China to figure out what the hype is all about. I’ve been playing with the device for a week and I must admit, Redmi has put its best foot forward with its first offering. Here’s why. Here’s the thing – the Redmi Note 7, to me, is one of the best-looking smartphones from Xiaomi’s stables, especially when compared to the other affordable handsets from the company. I spoke at length about the handset’s stunning design in my first impressions of the device but, at the expense of sounding like a broken record, the Redmi Note 7 looks like no other Xiaomi device in the market right now. In fact, the smartphone draws parallels to pricier offerings from Huawei and Honor with its gorgeous gradient-finish back, which shimmers ever so slightly when light bounces off it.  Much like most other competing phones in the market, the Redmi Note 7 too sports a glass-sandwich design which is held together by a metal trim. But for some reason, the smartphone feels uniquely premium and it’s every bit as luxurious to hold as say, the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus (review). It is about as one-hand friendly as the S9 Plus too, which means that you’ll basically have to use the device with both hands. Now, if you’re worried about the Note 7 creating a bulge in your pockets, then fret not. The handset is relatively sleek and sports rounded corners, which ensure that the device doesn’t bite your thigh while it’s in your pocket. The smartphone has just the right amount of weight to it, but it is top-heavy. And, despite some claims about the phone being fragile, I didn’t feel that the chassis would bend easily. In fact, I mostly put away the phone in my back pocket and after inadvertently sitting on it a couple times a day for a week, I didn’t notice any bend in the smartphone’s frame.  Adding to the list of pros, the gradient finish on the smartphone doesn’t attract fingerprints, but that could be limited to the vibrant blue hue I reviewed. If you pick up the smartphone in the black colourway, your mileage could vary. What’s more, unlike most smartphones launched nowadays, the Redmi Note 7 ships with an old-fashioned capacitive fingerprint sensor, as well as a headphone jack. I am glad Redmi didn’t jump on the in-display fingerprint sensor bandwagon because as it stands, a capacitive sensor is much more accurate and responsive. During my time with the device, the sensor didn’t falter once and unlocked the phone the second I put my index finger on it.  Redmi even gives you the option to unlock the Note 7 by using face recognition, which works fine too. The method is a tad bit slower, but I found it to be more convenient, so there’s that. And lest I forget, the smartphone features a USB Type-C port for charging – talk about leaving a lasting impression. For display, the Redmi Note 7 ships with a 6.3-inch FHD+ IPS panel which sports a waterdrop notch. Therefore, not only will you be able to enjoy the smartphone’s high-res display to the fullest, you won’t have to deal with an obnoxious cutout staring at you in the face either. The panel itself is quite good, and boasts excellent viewing angles and minimal colour shift when you tilt the device. I was satisfied with the display’s peak brightness levels too, and you won’t have to squint your eyes to read messages when you’re out and about.  Now, if you’ve looked up the Redmi Note 7 online, then you’ll know that the device ships with a sealant of sorts which prevents miniscule water droplets from entering the smartphone and damaging its innards. Now, as per Redmi, the smartphone isn’t IP certified, so you’ll have to take this information with a pinch of salt. I did test the claim and sprayed the smartphone with a few sprinkles of water and it worked fine afterwards. But, I’d suggest users exercise caution when handling the phone near a pool or in the bathroom. Xiaomi is known to offer extremely good camera phones in the affordable segment, and the same is true for the company’s latest debutant too. The USP of the Redmi Note 7 is the presence of a 48MP, f/1.8 aperture sensor on the back, which has been paired with a 5MP, f/2.4 aperture depth sensor. For selfies, the smartphone comes equipped with a single 13MP front shooter. Now, unlike the Honor View 20, the Redmi Note 7 doesn’t use Sony’s IMX586 sensor and instead, employs Samsung’s ISOCELL GM1 sensor. That said, both the sensors work on the same quad-Bayer principle, wherein four adjacent pixels combine to give light a bigger surface area to impact on, thereby capturing more information whilst outputting a 12MP image. Therefore, for the most part, the 48MP sensor actually functions like a 12MP unit and you’ll have to head over to the pro mode to capture images in glorious 48MP resolution. Now, having tested the camera intensively, I can confirm that the 48MP sensor is no gimmick and you will be able to see more details in the shots upon zooming in. However, the difference between a 12MP shot and a 48MP shot is not night and day, and during my review period, I was finding it harder and harder to justify clicking images in 48MP resolution.                 Don’t get me wrong, if you’ve got a penchant for landscape photography, then the smartphone’s 48MP sensor will serve you well. But, for my usage and photography style, capitalising on the sensor’s full resolution wasn’t just pointless, but cumbersome Having said that, the Redmi Note 7 is a phenomenal pocket shooter and I was more than satisfied with the smartphone’s camera prowess. To make things easier for you to understand, I’ll try to sum up my experience with the camera in bullet points, so here we go- The Redmi Note 7 is a star performer, which should come as little surprise when you glance at the device’s specs. My test unit of the device shipped with a Snapdragon 660 processor which worked alongside 3GB of RAM and 32GB of built-in, user expandable storage. However, the smartphone will also be available in higher RAM/storage SKUs. Regardless, I didn’t find any bottlenecking issues with the smartphone’s three gigs of memory. Apps opened swiftly and the device managed to keep around five applications in memory at all times, including some resource hungry apps like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.  The gaming performance of the smartphone was excellent too and I could comfortably run PUBG Mobile on medium graphics settings. There were some frame drops every now and then but for the most part, the game ran smoothly. Flip the page over to something less demanding such as Clash Royale or Alto’s Adventure and the handset didn’t show any signs of struggle.    The Redmi Note 7 is fuelled by a 4,000mAh battery which comfortably saw me through the end of a busy work day. To give you a clearer picture, my usage involved playing two classic matches in PUBG (both of which lasted well over 25 minutes), browsing through my social media feeds, texting on WhatsApp and watching some videos on YouTube. What’s more, in our battery test, the smartphone managed to play a full HD video on loop for 15 hours, which is quite nice. Lastly, the Redmi Note 7 comes with support for fast wired charging as the device adheres to Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4.0 standard. The caveat here is that the device – at least the Chinese unit – doesn’t ship with a fast charger out-of-the-box, and you’ll have to buy one separately.   As for software, the handset ships with Xiaomi’s proprietary MIUI v10 which runs on top of Android Pie. Now, as I mentioned at the beginning of my review, the unit I’m testing has been imported from China and consequently, it shipped with a ton of bloatware. Moreover, the smartphone didn’t come with Google’s suite of applications either, so I had to manually install them. Barring that, the software experience is like any other Xiaomi phone launched in India.   Features like Dual apps, Quick ball and support for various gestures can be found on the Redmi Note 7, and you can even apply custom EQ presets for when you connect headphones or earphones to the phone. As is customary with most other phones from the company’s stables, the Redmi Note 7 too comes with support for themes which you can apply to change the overall look of the UI. I’ll update the article once I get my hands on an Indian retail unit to highlight the differences between the two firmwares, so stay tuned. Here’s where things get tricky. The pricing for the Redmi Note 7 starts at 999 Yuan (~Rs 10K) for the base variant in China and the device is expected to be launched in India next month. As is customary with Xiaomi, we can expect the phone to be priced competitively (preferably under Rs 15K ) in India, which would make it a phenomenal deal. However, if you’re in a rush to buy a new smartphone and can’t wait until the launch day, then you won’t be short on options. There are plenty of devices with enticing features in the market right now, the likes of which include the OPPO K1 (first impressions), the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M2 (review), the Samsung Galaxy M20 (review) and the Realme 2 Pro (review).  However, most of these smartphones come with their fair share of compromises – be it their cameras that can’t match up or less than fancy designs. Therefore, on the whole, the Redmi Note 7 is quite honestly the best smartphone out there in its class. It looks good, performs great, clicks excellent photos and lasts a long, long time. Redmi undoubtedly has a winner on its hands and if priced correctly, the smartphone will easily blow the competition out of the water.     "

It is about as one-hand friendly as the S9 Plus too, which means that you’ll basically have to use the device with both hands. Now, if you’re worried about the Note 7 creating a bulge in your pockets, then fret not. The handset is relatively sleek and sports rounded corners, which ensure that the device doesn’t bite your thigh while it’s in your pocket. The smartphone has just the right amount of weight to it, but it is top-heavy. And, despite some claims about the phone being fragile, I didn’t feel that the chassis would bend easily. In fact, I mostly put away the phone in my back pocket and after inadvertently sitting on it a couple times a day for a week, I didn’t notice any bend in the smartphone’s   Adding to the list of pros, the gradient finish on the smartphone doesn’t attract fingerprints, but that could be limited to the vibrant blue hue I reviewed. If you pick up the smartphone in the black colourway, your mileage could vary. What’s more, unlike most smartphones launched nowadays, the Redmi Note 7 ships with an old-fashioned capacitive fingerprint sensor, as well as a headphone jack. I am glad Redmi didn’t jump on the in-display fingerprint sensor bandwagon because as it stands, a capacitive sensor is much more accurate and responsive. During my time with the device, the sensor didn’t falter once and unlocked the phone the second I put my index finger on it. For display, the Redmi Note 7 ships with a 6.3-inch FHD+ IPS panel which sports a waterdrop notch. Therefore, not only will you be able to enjoy the smartphone’s high-res display to the fullest, you won’t have to deal with an obnoxious cutout staring at you in the face either. The panel itself is quite good, and boasts excellent viewing angles and minimal colour shift when you tilt the device. I was satisfied with the display’s peak brightness levels too, and you won’t have to squint your eyes to read messages when you’re out and about.  Now, if you’ve looked up the Redmi Note 7 online, then you’ll know that the device ships with a sealant of sorts which prevents miniscule water droplets from entering the smartphone and damaging its innards. Now, as per Redmi, the smartphone isn’t IP certified, so you’ll have to take this information with a pinch of salt. I did test the claim and sprayed the smartphone with a few sprinkles of water and it worked fine afterwards. But, I’d suggest users exercise caution when handling the phone near a pool or in the bathroom. Xiaomi is known to offer extremely good camera phones in the affordable segment, and the same is true for the company’s latest debutant too. The USP of the Redmi Note 7 is the presence of a 48MP, f/1.8 aperture sensor on the back, which has been paired with a 5MP, f/2.4 aperture depth sensor. For selfies, the smartphone comes equipped with a single 13MP front shooter. Now, unlike the Honor View 20, the Redmi Note 7 doesn’t use Sony’s IMX586 sensor and instead, employs Samsung’s ISOCELL GM1 sensor. That said, both the sensors work on the same quad-Bayer principle, wherein four adjacent pixels combine to give light a bigger surface area to impact on, thereby capturing more information whilst outputting a 12MP image.}  Therefore, for the most part, the 48MP sensor actually functions like a 12MP unit and you’ll have to head over to the pro mode to capture images in glorious 48MP resolution. Now, having tested the camera intensively, I can confirm that the 48MP sensor is no gimmick and you will be able to see more details in the shots upon zooming in. However, the difference between a 12MP shot and a 48MP shot is not night and day, and during my review period, I was finding it harder and harder to justify clicking images in 48MP resolution.  Don’t get me wrong, if you’ve got a penchant for landscape photography, then the smartphone’s 48MP sensor will serve you well. But, for my usage and photography style, capitalising on the sensor’s full resolution wasn’t just pointless, but cumbersome as well.  Having said that, the Redmi Note 7 is a phenomenal pocket shooter and I was more than satisfied with the smartphone’s camera prowess. To make things easier for you to understand, I’ll try to sum up my experience with the camera in bullet points, so here we go- The Redmi Note 7 is a star performer, which should come as little surprise when you glance at the device’s specs. My test unit of the device shipped with a Snapdragon 660 processor which worked alongside 3GB of RAM and 32GB of built-in, user expandable storage. However, the smartphone will also be available in higher RAM/storage SKUs. Regardless, I didn’t find any bottlenecking issues with the smartphone’s three gigs of memory. Apps opened swiftly and the device managed to keep around five applications in memory at all times, including some resource hungry apps like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.  The gaming performance of the smartphone was excellent too and I could comfortably run PUBG Mobile on medium graphics settings. There were some frame drops every now and then but for the most part, the game ran smoothly. Flip the page over to something less demanding such as Clash Royale or Alto’s Adventure and the handset didn’t show any signs of struggle.    The Redmi Note 7 is fuelled by a 4,000mAh battery which comfortably saw me through the end of a busy work day. To give you a clearer picture, my usage involved playing two classic matches in PUBG (both of which lasted well over 25 minutes), browsing through my social media feeds, texting on WhatsApp and watching some videos on YouTube. What’s more, in our battery test, the smartphone managed to play a full HD video on loop for 15 hours, which is quite nice. Lastly, the Redmi Note 7 comes with support for fast wired charging as the device adheres to Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4.0 standard. The caveat here is that the device – at least the Chinese unit – doesn’t ship with a fast charger out-of-the-box, and you’ll have to buy one separately.   As for software, the handset ships with Xiaomi’s proprietary MIUI v10 which runs on top of Android Pie. Now, as I mentioned at the beginning of my review, the unit I’m testing has been imported from China and consequently, it shipped with a ton of bloatware. Moreover, the smartphone didn’t come with Google’s suite of applications either, so I had to manually install them. Barring that, the software experience is like any other Xiaomi phone launched in India.   Features like Dual apps, Quick ball and support for various gestures can be found on the Redmi Note 7, and you can even apply custom EQ presets for when you connect headphones or earphones to the phone. As is customary with most other phones from the company’s stables, the Redmi Note 7 too comes with support for themes which you can apply to change the overall look of the UI. I’ll update the article once I get my hands on an Indian retail unit to highlight the differences between the two firmwares, so stay tuned. Here’s where things get tricky. The pricing for the Redmi Note 7 starts at 999 Yuan (~Rs 10K) for the base variant in China and the device is expected to be launched in India next month. As is customary with Xiaomi, we can expect the phone to be priced competitively (preferably under Rs 15K ) in India, which would make it a phenomenal deal. However, if you’re in a rush to buy a new smartphone and can’t wait until the launch day, then you won’t be short on options. There are plenty of devices with enticing features in the market right now, the likes of which include the OPPO K1 (first impressions), the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M2 (review), the Samsung Galaxy M20 (review) and the Realme 2 Pro (review).  However, most of these smartphones come with their fair share of compromises – be it their cameras that can’t match up or less than fancy designs. Therefore, on the whole, the Redmi Note 7 is quite honestly the best smartphone out there in its class. It looks good, performs great, clicks excellent photos and lasts a long, long time. Redmi undoubtedly has a winner on its hands and if priced correctly, the smartphone will easily blow the competition out of the water.     "

The manufacturer has all but become a household name in the country by offering buyers compelling smartphones which don’t break the bank. That said, the company recently made headlines not for selling a stock of smartphones in a matter of seconds, but for announcing that it’s spinning off its popular Redmi series into a sub brand. And the very first offering from the new sub brand is the recently announced Redmi Note 7 (first impressions). The device seems to have created ripples, all thanks to its headlining 48MP camera and loaded specs, offered at a mouth-watering price. While the phone is yet to make its way to our shores, we imported a unit from China to figure out what the hype is all about. I’ve been playing with the device for a week and I must admit, Redmi has put its best foot forward with its first offering. Here’s why. Here’s the thing – the Redmi Note 7, to me, is one of the best-looking smartphones from Xiaomi’s stables, especially when compared to the other affordable handsets from the company. I spoke at length about the handset’s stunning design in my first impressions of the device but, at the expense of sounding like a broken record, the Redmi Note 7 looks like no other Xiaomi device in the market right now.

For display, the Redmi Note 7 ships with a 6.3-inch FHD+ IPS panel which sports a waterdrop notch. Therefore, not only will you be able to enjoy the smartphone’s high-res display to the fullest, you won’t have to deal with an obnoxious cutout staring at you in the face either. The panel itself is quite good, and boasts excellent viewing angles and minimal colour shift when you tilt the device. I was satisfied with the display’s peak brightness levels too, and you won’t have to squint your eyes to read messages when you’re out and about.  Now, if you’ve looked up the Redmi Note 7 online, then you’ll know that the device ships with a sealant of sorts which prevents miniscule water droplets from entering the smartphone and damaging its innards. Now, as per Redmi, the smartphone isn’t IP certified, so you’ll have to take this information with a pinch of salt. I did test the claim and sprayed the smartphone with a few sprinkles of water and it worked fine afterwards. But, I’d suggest users exercise caution when handling the phone near a pool or in the bathroom. Xiaomi is known to offer extremely good camera phones in the affordable segment, and the same is true for the company’s latest debutant too. The USP of the Redmi Note 7 is the presence of a 48MP, f/1.8 aperture sensor on the back, which has been paired with a 5MP, f/2.4 aperture depth sensor. For selfies, the smartphone comes equipped with a single 13MP front shooter. Now, unlike the Honor View 20, the Redmi Note 7 doesn’t use Sony’s IMX586 sensor and instead, employs Samsung’s ISOCELL GM1 sensor. That said, both the sensors work on the same quad-Bayer principle, wherein four adjacent pixels combine to give light a bigger surface area to impact on, thereby capturing more information whilst outputting a 12MP image. Therefore, for the most part, the 48MP sensor actually functions like a 12MP unit and you’ll have to head over to the pro mode to capture images in glorious 48MP resolution. Now, having tested the camera intensively, I can confirm that the 48MP sensor is no gimmick and you will be able to see more details in the shots upon zooming in. However, the difference between a 12MP shot and a 48MP shot is not night and day, and during my review period, I was finding it harder and harder to justify clicking images in 48MP resolution.                 Don’t get me wrong, if you’ve got a penchant for landscape photography, then the smartphone’s 48MP sensor will serve you well. But, for my usage and photography style, capitalising on the sensor’s full resolution wasn’t just pointless, but cumbersome Having said that, the Redmi Note 7 is a phenomenal pocket shooter and I was more than satisfied with the smartphone’s camera prowess. To make things easier for you to understand, I’ll try to sum up my experience with the camera in bullet points, so here we go- The Redmi Note 7 is a star performer, which should come as little surprise when you glance at the device’s specs. My test unit of the device shipped with a Snapdragon 660 processor which worked alongside 3GB of RAM and 32GB of built-in, user expandable storage. However, the smartphone will also be available in higher RAM/storage SKUs. Regardless, I didn’t find any bottlenecking issues with the smartphone’s three gigs of memory. Apps opened swiftly and the device managed to keep around five applications in memory at all times, including some resource hungry apps like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.  The gaming performance of the smartphone was excellent too and I could comfortably run PUBG Mobile on medium graphics settings. There were some frame drops every now and then but for the most part, the game ran smoothly. Flip the page over to something less demanding such as Clash Royale or Alto’s Adventure and the handset didn’t show any signs of struggle.    The Redmi Note 7 is fuelled by a 4,000mAh battery which comfortably saw me through the end of a busy work day. To give you a clearer picture, my usage involved playing two classic matches in PUBG (both of which lasted well over 25 minutes), browsing through my social media feeds, texting on WhatsApp and watching some videos on YouTube. What’s more, in our battery test, the smartphone managed to play a full HD video on loop for 15 hours, which is quite nice. Lastly, the Redmi Note 7 comes with support for fast wired charging as the device adheres to Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4.0 standard. The caveat here is that the device – at least the Chinese unit – doesn’t ship with a fast charger out-of-the-box, and you’ll have to buy one separately.   As for software, the handset ships with Xiaomi’s proprietary MIUI v10 which runs on top of Android Pie. Now, as I mentioned at the beginning of my review, the unit I’m testing has been imported from China and consequently, it shipped with a ton of bloatware. Moreover, the smartphone didn’t come with Google’s suite of applications either, so I had to manually install them. Barring that, the software experience is like any other Xiaomi phone launched in India.   Features like Dual apps, Quick ball and support for various gestures can be found on the Redmi Note 7, and you can even apply custom EQ presets for when you connect headphones or earphones to the phone. As is customary with most other phones from the company’s stables, the Redmi Note 7 too comes with support for themes which you can apply to change the overall look of the UI. I’ll update the article once I get my hands on an Indian retail unit to highlight the differences between the two firmwares, so stay tuned. Here’s where things get tricky. The pricing for the Redmi Note 7 starts at 999 Yuan (~Rs 10K) for the base variant in China and the device is expected to be launched in India next month. As is customary with Xiaomi, we can expect the phone to be priced competitively (preferably under Rs 15K ) in India, which would make it a phenomenal deal. However, if you’re in a rush to buy a new smartphone and can’t wait until the launch day, then you won’t be short on options. There are plenty of devices with enticing features in the market right now, the likes of which include the OPPO K1 (first impressions), the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M2 (review), the Samsung Galaxy M20 (review) and the Realme 2 Pro (review).  However, most of these smartphones come with their fair share of compromises – be it their cameras that can’t match up or less than fancy designs. Therefore, on the whole, the Redmi Note 7 is quite honestly the best smartphone out there in its class. It looks good, performs great, clicks excellent photos and lasts a long, long time. Redmi undoubtedly has a winner on its hands and if priced correctly, the smartphone will easily blow the competition out of the water.     "
2464,30,33386,,,2019-02-08,,33386,Prateek Pandey -,Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 review: well worth your money,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-note-7-review?pid=33386," “Our two cents on the most affordable smartphone that boasts a 48MP camera, the Redmi Note 7 If there’s one smartphone manufacturer which has had an enormous impact in the Indian smartphone market, it’s undoubtedly Xiaomi. The manufacturer has all but become a household name in the country by offering buyers compelling smartphones which don’t break the bank. That said, the company recently made headlines not for selling a stock of smartphones in a matter of seconds, but for announcing that it’s spinning off its popular Redmi series into a sub brand. And the very first offering from the new sub brand is the recently announced Redmi Note 7 (first impressions). The device seems to have created ripples, all thanks to its headlining 48MP camera and loaded specs, offered at a mouth-watering price. While the phone is yet to make its way to our shores, we imported a unit from China to figure out what the hype is all about. I’ve been playing with the device for a week and I must admit, Redmi has put its best foot forward with its first offering. Here’s why. Here’s the thing – the Redmi Note 7, to me, is one of the best-looking smartphones from Xiaomi’s stables, especially when compared to the other affordable handsets from the company. I spoke at length about the handset’s stunning design in my first impressions of the device but, at the expense of sounding like a broken record, the Redmi Note 7 looks like no other Xiaomi device in the market right now. In fact, the smartphone draws parallels to pricier offerings from Huawei and Honor with its gorgeous gradient-finish back, which shimmers ever so slightly when light bounces off it.  Much like most other competing phones in the market, the Redmi Note 7 too sports a glass-sandwich design which is held together by a metal trim. But for some reason, the smartphone feels uniquely premium and it’s every bit as luxurious to hold as say, the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus (review). It is about as one-hand friendly as the S9 Plus too, which means that you’ll basically have to use the device with both hands. Now, if you’re worried about the Note 7 creating a bulge in your pockets, then fret not. The handset is relatively sleek and sports rounded corners, which ensure that the device doesn’t bite your thigh while it’s in your pocket. The smartphone has just the right amount of weight to it, but it is top-heavy. And, despite some claims about the phone being fragile, I didn’t feel that the chassis would bend easily. In fact, I mostly put away the phone in my back pocket and after inadvertently sitting on it a couple times a day for a week, I didn’t notice any bend in the smartphone’s frame.  Adding to the list of pros, the gradient finish on the smartphone doesn’t attract fingerprints, but that could be limited to the vibrant blue hue I reviewed. If you pick up the smartphone in the black colourway, your mileage could vary. What’s more, unlike most smartphones launched nowadays, the Redmi Note 7 ships with an old-fashioned capacitive fingerprint sensor, as well as a headphone jack. I am glad Redmi didn’t jump on the in-display fingerprint sensor bandwagon because as it stands, a capacitive sensor is much more accurate and responsive. During my time with the device, the sensor didn’t falter once and unlocked the phone the second I put my index finger on it.  Redmi even gives you the option to unlock the Note 7 by using face recognition, which works fine too. The method is a tad bit slower, but I found it to be more convenient, so there’s that. And lest I forget, the smartphone features a USB Type-C port for charging – talk about leaving a lasting impression.

Now, unlike the Honor View 20, the Redmi Note 7 doesn’t use Sony’s IMX586 sensor and instead, employs Samsung’s ISOCELL GM1 sensor. That said, both the sensors work on the same quad-Bayer principle, wherein four adjacent pixels combine to give light a bigger surface area to impact on, thereby capturing more information whilst outputting a 12MP image. Therefore, for the most part, the 48MP sensor actually functions like a 12MP unit and you’ll have to head over to the pro mode to capture images in glorious 48MP resolution. Now, having tested the camera intensively, I can confirm that the 48MP sensor is no gimmick and you will be able to see more details in the shots upon zooming in. However, the difference between a 12MP shot and a 48MP shot is not night and day, and during my review period, I was finding it harder and harder to justify clicking images in 48MP resolution.                 Don’t get me wrong, if you’ve got a penchant for landscape photography, then the smartphone’s 48MP sensor will serve you well. But, for my usage and photography style, capitalising on the sensor’s full resolution wasn’t just pointless, but cumbersome Having said that, the Redmi Note 7 is a phenomenal pocket shooter and I was more than satisfied with the smartphone’s camera prowess. To make things easier for you to understand, I’ll try to sum up my experience with the camera in bullet points, so here we go- The Redmi Note 7 is a star performer, which should come as little surprise when you glance at the device’s specs. My test unit of the device shipped with a Snapdragon 660 processor which worked alongside 3GB of RAM and 32GB of built-in, user expandable storage. However, the smartphone will also be available in higher RAM/storage SKUs. Regardless, I didn’t find any bottlenecking issues with the smartphone’s three gigs of memory. Apps opened swiftly and the device managed to keep around five applications in memory at all times, including some resource hungry apps like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.  The gaming performance of the smartphone was excellent too and I could comfortably run PUBG Mobile on medium graphics settings. There were some frame drops every now and then but for the most part, the game ran smoothly. Flip the page over to something less demanding such as Clash Royale or Alto’s Adventure and the handset didn’t show any signs of struggle.    The Redmi Note 7 is fuelled by a 4,000mAh battery which comfortably saw me through the end of a busy work day. To give you a clearer picture, my usage involved playing two classic matches in PUBG (both of which lasted well over 25 minutes), browsing through my social media feeds, texting on WhatsApp and watching some videos on YouTube. What’s more, in our battery test, the smartphone managed to play a full HD video on loop for 15 hours, which is quite nice. Lastly, the Redmi Note 7 comes with support for fast wired charging as the device adheres to Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4.0 standard. The caveat here is that the device – at least the Chinese unit – doesn’t ship with a fast charger out-of-the-box, and you’ll have to buy one separately.   As for software, the handset ships with Xiaomi’s proprietary MIUI v10 which runs on top of Android Pie. Now, as I mentioned at the beginning of my review, the unit I’m testing has been imported from China and consequently, it shipped with a ton of bloatware. Moreover, the smartphone didn’t come with Google’s suite of applications either, so I had to manually install them. Barring that, the software experience is like any other Xiaomi phone launched in India.   Features like Dual apps, Quick ball and support for various gestures can be found on the Redmi Note 7, and you can even apply custom EQ presets for when you connect headphones or earphones to the phone. As is customary with most other phones from the company’s stables, the Redmi Note 7 too comes with support for themes which you can apply to change the overall look of the UI. I’ll update the article once I get my hands on an Indian retail unit to highlight the differences between the two firmwares, so stay tuned. Here’s where things get tricky. The pricing for the Redmi Note 7 starts at 999 Yuan (~Rs 10K) for the base variant in China and the device is expected to be launched in India next month. As is customary with Xiaomi, we can expect the phone to be priced competitively (preferably under Rs 15K ) in India, which would make it a phenomenal deal. However, if you’re in a rush to buy a new smartphone and can’t wait until the launch day, then you won’t be short on options. There are plenty of devices with enticing features in the market right now, the likes of which include the OPPO K1 (first impressions), the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M2 (review), the Samsung Galaxy M20 (review) and the Realme 2 Pro (review).  However, most of these smartphones come with their fair share of compromises – be it their cameras that can’t match up or less than fancy designs. Therefore, on the whole, the Redmi Note 7 is quite honestly the best smartphone out there in its class. It looks good, performs great, clicks excellent photos and lasts a long, long time. Redmi undoubtedly has a winner on its hands and if priced correctly, the smartphone will easily blow the competition out of the water.     "
2464,30,33386,,,2019-02-08,,33386,Prateek Pandey -,Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 review: well worth your money,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-note-7-review?pid=33386," “Our two cents on the most affordable smartphone that boasts a 48MP camera, the Redmi Note 7 If there’s one smartphone manufacturer which has had an enormous impact in the Indian smartphone market, it’s undoubtedly Xiaomi. The manufacturer has all but become a household name in the country by offering buyers compelling smartphones which don’t break the bank. That said, the company recently made headlines not for selling a stock of smartphones in a matter of seconds, but for announcing that it’s spinning off its popular Redmi series into a sub brand. And the very first offering from the new sub brand is the recently announced Redmi Note 7 (first impressions). The device seems to have created ripples, all thanks to its headlining 48MP camera and loaded specs, offered at a mouth-watering price. While the phone is yet to make its way to our shores, we imported a unit from China to figure out what the hype is all about. I’ve been playing with the device for a week and I must admit, Redmi has put its best foot forward with its first offering. Here’s why. Here’s the thing – the Redmi Note 7, to me, is one of the best-looking smartphones from Xiaomi’s stables, especially when compared to the other affordable handsets from the company. I spoke at length about the handset’s stunning design in my first impressions of the device but, at the expense of sounding like a broken record, the Redmi Note 7 looks like no other Xiaomi device in the market right now. In fact, the smartphone draws parallels to pricier offerings from Huawei and Honor with its gorgeous gradient-finish back, which shimmers ever so slightly when light bounces off it.  Much like most other competing phones in the market, the Redmi Note 7 too sports a glass-sandwich design which is held together by a metal trim. But for some reason, the smartphone feels uniquely premium and it’s every bit as luxurious to hold as say, the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus (review). It is about as one-hand friendly as the S9 Plus too, which means that you’ll basically have to use the device with both hands. Now, if you’re worried about the Note 7 creating a bulge in your pockets, then fret not. The handset is relatively sleek and sports rounded corners, which ensure that the device doesn’t bite your thigh while it’s in your pocket. The smartphone has just the right amount of weight to it, but it is top-heavy. And, despite some claims about the phone being fragile, I didn’t feel that the chassis would bend easily. In fact, I mostly put away the phone in my back pocket and after inadvertently sitting on it a couple times a day for a week, I didn’t notice any bend in the smartphone’s frame.  Adding to the list of pros, the gradient finish on the smartphone doesn’t attract fingerprints, but that could be limited to the vibrant blue hue I reviewed. If you pick up the smartphone in the black colourway, your mileage could vary. What’s more, unlike most smartphones launched nowadays, the Redmi Note 7 ships with an old-fashioned capacitive fingerprint sensor, as well as a headphone jack. I am glad Redmi didn’t jump on the in-display fingerprint sensor bandwagon because as it stands, a capacitive sensor is much more accurate and responsive. During my time with the device, the sensor didn’t falter once and unlocked the phone the second I put my index finger on it.  Redmi even gives you the option to unlock the Note 7 by using face recognition, which works fine too. The method is a tad bit slower, but I found it to be more convenient, so there’s that. And lest I forget, the smartphone features a USB Type-C port for charging – talk about leaving a lasting impression. For display, the Redmi Note 7 ships with a 6.3-inch FHD+ IPS panel which sports a waterdrop notch. Therefore, not only will you be able to enjoy the smartphone’s high-res display to the fullest, you won’t have to deal with an obnoxious cutout staring at you in the face either. The panel itself is quite good, and boasts excellent viewing angles and minimal colour shift when you tilt the device. I was satisfied with the display’s peak brightness levels too, and you won’t have to squint your eyes to read messages when you’re out and about.  Now, if you’ve looked up the Redmi Note 7 online, then you’ll know that the device ships with a sealant of sorts which prevents miniscule water droplets from entering the smartphone and damaging its innards. Now, as per Redmi, the smartphone isn’t IP certified, so you’ll have to take this information with a pinch of salt. I did test the claim and sprayed the smartphone with a few sprinkles of water and it worked fine afterwards. But, I’d suggest users exercise caution when handling the phone near a pool or in the bathroom. Xiaomi is known to offer extremely good camera phones in the affordable segment, and the same is true for the company’s latest debutant too. The USP of the Redmi Note 7 is the presence of a 48MP, f/1.8 aperture sensor on the back, which has been paired with a 5MP, f/2.4 aperture depth sensor.

To make things easier for you to understand, I’ll try to sum up my experience with the camera in bullet points, so here we go- The Redmi Note 7 is a star performer, which should come as little surprise when you glance at the device’s specs. My test unit of the device shipped with a Snapdragon 660 processor which worked alongside 3GB of RAM and 32GB of built-in, user expandable storage. However, the smartphone will also be available in higher RAM/storage SKUs. Regardless, I didn’t find any bottlenecking issues with the smartphone’s three gigs of memory. Apps opened swiftly and the device managed to keep around five applications in memory at all times, including some resource hungry apps like Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.  The gaming performance of the smartphone was excellent too and I could comfortably run PUBG Mobile on medium graphics settings. There were some frame drops every now and then but for the most part, the game ran smoothly. Flip the page over to something less demanding such as Clash Royale or Alto’s Adventure and the handset didn’t show any signs of struggle.    The Redmi Note 7 is fuelled by a 4,000mAh battery which comfortably saw me through the end of a busy work day. To give you a clearer picture, my usage involved playing two classic matches in PUBG (both of which lasted well over 25 minutes), browsing through my social media feeds, texting on WhatsApp and watching some videos on YouTube. What’s more, in our battery test, the smartphone managed to play a full HD video on loop for 15 hours, which is quite nice. Lastly, the Redmi Note 7 comes with support for fast wired charging as the device adheres to Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4.0 standard. The caveat here is that the device – at least the Chinese unit – doesn’t ship with a fast charger out-of-the-box, and you’ll have to buy one separately.   As for software, the handset ships with Xiaomi’s proprietary MIUI v10 which runs on top of Android Pie. Now, as I mentioned at the beginning of my review, the unit I’m testing has been imported from China and consequently, it shipped with a ton of bloatware. Moreover, the smartphone didn’t come with Google’s suite of applications either, so I had to manually install them. Barring that, the software experience is like any other Xiaomi phone launched in India.   Features like Dual apps, Quick ball and support for various gestures can be found on the Redmi Note 7, and you can even apply custom EQ presets for when you connect headphones or earphones to the phone. As is customary with most other phones from the company’s stables, the Redmi Note 7 too comes with support for themes which you can apply to change the overall look of the UI. I’ll update the article once I get my hands on an Indian retail unit to highlight the differences between the two firmwares, so stay tuned. Here’s where things get tricky. The pricing for the Redmi Note 7 starts at 999 Yuan (~Rs 10K) for the base variant in China and the device is expected to be launched in India next month. As is customary with Xiaomi, we can expect the phone to be priced competitively (preferably under Rs 15K ) in India, which would make it a phenomenal deal. However, if you’re in a rush to buy a new smartphone and can’t wait until the launch day, then you won’t be short on options. There are plenty of devices with enticing features in the market right now, the likes of which include the OPPO K1 (first impressions), the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M2 (review), the Samsung Galaxy M20 (review) and the Realme 2 Pro (review).  However, most of these smartphones come with their fair share of compromises – be it their cameras that can’t match up or less than fancy designs. Therefore, on the whole, the Redmi Note 7 is quite honestly the best smartphone out there in its class. It looks good, performs great, clicks excellent photos and lasts a long, long time. Redmi undoubtedly has a winner on its hands and if priced correctly, the smartphone will easily blow the competition out of the water.     "
2464,30,33556,,,2019-02-08,,33556,Prateek Pandey -,Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 review: well worth your money,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-note-7-review?pid=33556," “Our two cents on the most affordable smartphone that boasts a 48MP camera, the Redmi Note 7If there’s one smartphone manufacturer which has had an enormous impact in the Indian smartphone market, it’s undoubtedly Xiaomi. The manufacturer has all but become a household name in the country by offering buyers compelling smartphones which don’t break the bank. That said, the company recently made headlines not for selling a stock of smartphones in a matter of seconds, but for announcing that it’s spinning off its popular Redmi series into a sub brand. And the very first offering from the new sub brand is the recently announced Redmi Note 7 (first impressions). The device seems to have created ripples, all thanks to its headlining 48MP camera and loaded specs, offered at a mouth-watering price. While the phone is yet to make its way to our shores, we imported a unit from China to figure out what the hype is all about. I’ve been playing with the device for a week and I must admit, Redmi has put its best foot forward with its first offering. Here’s why.  Here’s the thing – the Redmi Note 7, to me, is one of the best-looking smartphones from Xiaomi’s stables, especially when compared to the other affordable handsets from the company. I spoke at length about the handset’s stunning design in my first impressions of the device but, at the expense of sounding like a broken record, the Redmi Note 7 looks like no other Xiaomi device in the market right now. In fact, the smartphone draws parallels to pricier offerings from Huawei and Honor with its gorgeous gradient-finish back, which shimmers ever so slightly when light bounces off it. Much like most other competing phones in the market, the Redmi Note 7 too sports a glass-sandwich design which is held together by a metal trim. But for some reason, the smartphone feels uniquely premium and it’s every bit as luxurious to hold as say, the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus (review). It is about as one-hand friendly as the S9 Plus too, which means that you’ll basically have to use the device with both hands. Now, if you’re worried about the Note 7 creating a bulge in your pockets, then fret not. The handset is relatively sleek and sports rounded corners, which ensure that the device doesn’t bite your thigh while it’s in your pocket. The smartphone has just the right amount of weight to it, but it is top-heavy. And, despite some claims about the phone being fragile, I didn’t feel that the chassis would bend easily. In fact, I mostly put away the phone in my back pocket and after inadvertently sitting on it a couple times a day for a week, I didn’t notice any bend in the smartphone’s frame. Adding to the list of pros, the gradient finish on the smartphone doesn’t attract fingerprints, but that could be limited to the vibrant blue hue I reviewed. If you pick up the smartphone in the black colourway, your mileage could vary. What’s more, unlike most smartphones launched nowadays, the Redmi Note 7 ships with an old-fashioned capacitive fingerprint sensor, as well as a headphone jack. I am glad Redmi didn’t jump on the in-display fingerprint sensor bandwagon because as it stands, a capacitive sensor is much more accurate and responsive. During my time with the device, the sensor didn’t falter once and unlocked the phone the second I put my index finger on it. Redmi even gives you the option to unlock the Note 7 by using face recognition, which works fine too. The method is a tad bit slower, but I found it to be more convenient, so there’s that. And lest I forget, the smartphone features a USB Type-C port for charging – talk about leaving a lasting impression.For display, the Redmi Note 7 ships with a 6.3-inch FHD+ IPS panel which sports a waterdrop notch. Therefore, not only will you be able to enjoy the smartphone’s high-res display to the fullest, you won’t have to deal with an obnoxious cutout staring at you in the face either. The panel itself is quite good, and boasts excellent viewing angles and minimal colour shift when you tilt the device. I was satisfied with the display’s peak brightness levels too, and you won’t have to squint your eyes to read messages when you’re out and about.  Now, if you’ve looked up the Redmi Note 7 online, then you’ll know that the device ships with a sealant of sorts which prevents miniscule water droplets from entering the smartphone and damaging its innards. Now, as per Redmi, the smartphone isn’t IP certified, so you’ll have to take this information with a pinch of salt. I did test the claim and sprayed the smartphone with a few sprinkles of water and it worked fine afterwards. But, I’d suggest users exercise caution when handling the phone near a pool or in the bathroom. Xiaomi is known to offer extremely good camera phones in the affordable segment, and the same is true for the company’s latest debutant too. The USP of the Redmi Note 7 is the presence of a 48MP, f/1.8 aperture sensor on the back, which has been paired with a 5MP, f/2.4 aperture depth sensor. For selfies, the smartphone comes equipped with a single 13MP front shooter. Now, unlike the Honor View 20, the Redmi Note 7 doesn’t use Sony’s IMX586 sensor and instead, employs Samsung’s ISOCELL GM1 sensor. That said, both the sensors work on the same quad-Bayer principle, wherein four adjacent pixels combine to give light a bigger surface area to impact on, thereby capturing more information whilst outputting a 12MP image.  Therefore, for the most part, the 48MP sensor actually functions like a 12MP unit and you’ll have to head over to the pro mode to capture images in glorious 48MP resolution. Now, having tested the camera intensively, I can confirm that the 48MP sensor is no gimmick and you will be able to see more details in the shots upon zooming in. However, the difference between a 12MP shot and a 48MP shot is not night and day, and during my review period, I was finding it harder and harder to justify clicking images in 48MP resolution.                 Don’t get me wrong, if you’ve got a penchant for landscape photography, then the smartphone’s 48MP sensor will serve you well.

2202,30,31646,3.5,5,2017-11-16,,31646,Swapnil Mathur -,Xiaomi Redmi Y1 review: all about the selfie,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-y1-review?pid=31646," There are few trends prevalent in the smartphone segment which show no signs of letting up. Besides the consumers’ desire for thinner phones and dual-lens setups, the “selfie” trend is one that has endured and grown over the years. Companies have dedicated entire product lines and device portfolios to creating smartphones whose singular USP was a refined front-facing camera. Xiaomi is one brand that had remained ominously absent from this segment, but with the Redmi Y1 (first impressions), that has all changed. The Redmi Y1 is Xiaomi’s first smartphone which focuses more on the selfie camera than the primary shooter. While the new focus on the front facing imaging is great, does the Redmi Y1 offer more than just a singular feature? Wondering whether your money is justified by the Redmi Y1? We’ve spent an extensive amount of time with the phone, understanding its strengths and weaknesses so that you can make an informed purchase decision.The first thing you ever take notice of in a smartphone is its design, followed by the feel of the device in your hands. The two are more or less synonymous with each other, with a poor design resulting in a sub-par handling experience. With the Xiaomi Redmi Y1, things are a little bit of a mixed bag. The Xiaomi Remi Y1 is unmistakably made of plastic, and not that super sturdy polycarbonate kind. The design is fairly generic, with a soft gold smooth finish on the back and a white bezel on the front. The only break in the design language is the singular 13-megapixel sensor on the back and a fingerprint sensor. The front, on the other hand, has the front-facing camera, an ambient light sensor and a soft LED flash, all in the form of three black circles. They do tend to stand out a little bit, but it’s not a deal breaker.  In terms of the quality of the phone, being made entirely of plastic, you do feel the materials by weight. The Xiaomi Redmi Y1 is fairly light for a 5.5-inch smartphone and while that’s a good thing, we do miss the metal finish of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. While the design and build quality are fairly average, one point of contention we had was with the fit of the SIM card tray. The tray does not sit flush with the body like on most Android phones nowadays and unfortunately, does not lend any elegance to the design. If this phone is forever going to live in a case, then it’s not so much of an issue, but if you are going to be using it without protection, the SIM tray might look like an eye-sore to some. The price tag of Rs. 8,999 does not get your stellar build quality, and for the price, there are phones out there that have a better finish and use much better construction materials.The Xiaomi Redmi Y1 is the company’s first selfie-centric phone. It has a fairly standard 13-megapixel rear camera with PDAF and a single LED flash, but the front camera is a 16-megapixel shooter accompanied by a soft light LED. The primary camera shoots images that are average at best, with the weakest point being dynamic range. Don’t expect a perfect exposure if you’re shooting a subject in harsh light, however, if you are in more forgiving illumination such as indoors or outdoors during a cloudy day (or even shooting in shade) you should able to get good looking photos. One thing you shouldn’t expect out of these photos is a great level of detail as Xiaomi uses some very aggressive JPG compression algorithms. It was a little disappointing to take a photo of a beautiful flower and find very little detail in the texture of the leaves and petals. While the rear camera performance might be in line with what we’ve seen from other smartphones in this segment, where the Redmi Y1 sets itself apart is with the selfie camera. The soft light LED has only an arm’s reach worth of power, but it will get you that odd selfie in a pinch. What really did impress us was the selfie-focussed algorithms running in the background. Regardless of where you’re trying to take a selfie, once the camera locks onto your face (and it is very good at doing so) it prioritises the exposure of the face over the ambient conditions. In most cases, this is great, especially when you’re shooting selfies in harsh light, whether sunlight or even indoor, office lighting. The camera will also let you get creative with sun flare if you position it just right, without ruining the photo. The photos do lack texture detail, but given the obsession with the beautification of selfies, the skin comes out looking soft. As a selfie camera, the Redmi Y1 does impress in ways that it should. Our review unit of the Xiaomi Remi Y1 came preloaded with a beta build of MIUI 9, which is a result of Xiaomi’s own layer running on top of Android Nougat. MIUI 9 was announced the same day as the Redmi Y1, but it seems that the final version is yet to be rolled out. We did face minor hiccups on the Redmi Y1 in terms of performance, all of which could easily be attributed to the fact that our unit was running a beta build. Among the few things that worked well was the split-screen feature which didn’t stutter at all. The newly redesigned notification pane is also nice, but that would be a personal preference more than anything else. While most of the aspects of MIUI 9 worked smooth, there were some minor issues that can be attributed to the beta build of the OS. For starters, we occasionally faced issues with the keyboard not popping up for a few seconds. This problem was only intermittent and only presented itself arbitrarily. Occasionally the camera app would lock us out too, but it was again arbitrary and it is possible that all of this would go away once the final build of MIUI 9 is released for the Y1. Regardless of the changes, MIUI 9 is distinctly ‘Xiaomi’ and loyalists of the brand are right to be excited about this new OS. You still get a slew of customisation options and the themes app will give you access to innumerable themes for every design sensibility. MIUI 9 even in beta was fairly smooth, save for minor bugs here and there. Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor and 3GB of RAM, the Xiaomi Redmi Y1 isn’t the smartphone to offer the most cutting-edge specifications for the price bracket. The similarly-priced Xiaomi Redmi 4 (review) has the same specs as the Y1 or the most part as well, although, for a little more money, you could get yourself the Redmi Note 4 with the Snapdragon 625 processor.  Let’s just get the minor hiccups out of the way first. Our unit had a tough time keeping up with the fast-paced action of Injustice 2: Gods Amongst Us. Asphalt 8 saw a few minor frame drops as well, but games like Sonic Surge, Subway Surfers and even Angry Birds (if you’re still not over taking down those pigs) worked without a hitch. Casual gaming is no longer a problem even on seemingly less powerful components thanks to processors becoming more efficient and developers optimising many of their apps to work better on lower-end components.   In our time with the Xiaomi Redmi Y1, we noticed that apps by themselves work without any issues, save for the minor extended load times, but where we noticed problems was in the little things such as when the keyboard was supposed to pop up for typing a message. Occasionally, it would take the keyboard as long as three seconds to come up. Sometimes switching between apps lagged, but the instances of this were very few. Since this is a beta ROM, we’re sure Xiaomi will iron out the minor performance hiccups through an update. As a daily driver, the Xiaomi Y1 is not a bad choice. It just manages to keep things working well enough to not turn the user experience into a frustrating one. There were very few crashes (a total of three), although we did feel the need to close background apps every few hours. Surprisingly, despite running through the whole gamut of usage scenarios, we did not face any excessive heating of the device, which is a great sign.  The Xiaomi Redmi Y1 is powered by a 3,080mAh battery, a pretty standard number for most smartphones today. What you don’t get, however, is fast charging, which is a feature missing from this entire price bracket for the most part anyway. The phone ends up taking a little over two hours to charge from zero to 100, so the best time to charge the phone would most likely be while going to bed, or like me, you can charge it at work, with the small caveat that you’re going to be glued to your seat till the battery reaches 100 percent So what does the two and a half hours of charging time get you? In our time with the phone, we used it as our primary device for well over a week and consistently, the phone had 15-20 percent battery left by the time we went to bed. Typically, the phone would come off the charger by 8am, and be plugged back in around 1am. On our video loop test, which we do by running an HD version of The Hobbit’s trailer, the phone lasted a little over eight hours, at 50 percent brightness and volume, with both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth turned off. Overall, the battery life is satisfactory for a phone with its battery capacity. In our time with the Xiaomi Redmi Y1, the question of why someone would want to buy this phone popped up a number of times. Besides what the competition has to offer, Xiaomi itself has the Redmi 4, available for the same price, offering the same specification set, but in a metal body. It is a slightly smaller form factor (5-inch) with the same 720p display as the Y1. The Redmi 4 also offers a larger 4,000mAh battery in comparison to the 3,080mAh battery on the Y1. Interestingly, even though the two phones may be incredibly similar, they would ideally appeal to very different audiences. The Y1 is squarely aimed at people who put the selfie experience before most other things. For those who prefer a metal built phone, the Redmi 4 may be a better option, albeit with a smaller screen. Performance wise, both phones are on par in terms of their hardware, but it’s the feature set that varies.  Having said that, for Rs 8,999, you finally get a Xiaomi smartphone which plays the selfie game well. If you ever felt that the OPPO or Vivo’s portfolio of devices were out of your budget, there’s now a viable option even in the sub-Rs 10K price range.      Photos by Raj Rout"
2202,30,31646,3.5,5,2017-11-16,,31646,Swapnil Mathur -,Xiaomi Redmi Y1 review: all about the selfie,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-y1-review?pid=31646," There are few trends prevalent in the smartphone segment which show no signs of letting up. Besides the consumers’ desire for thinner phones and dual-lens setups, the “selfie” trend is one that has endured and grown over the years. Companies have dedicated entire product lines and device portfolios to creating smartphones whose singular USP was a refined front-facing camera. Xiaomi is one brand that had remained ominously absent from this segment, but with the Redmi Y1 (first impressions), that has all changed. The Redmi Y1 is Xiaomi’s first smartphone which focuses more on the selfie camera than the primary shooter. While the new focus on the front facing imaging is great, does the Redmi Y1 offer more than just a singular feature? Wondering whether your money is justified by the Redmi Y1? We’ve spent an extensive amount of time with the phone, understanding its strengths and weaknesses so that you can make an informed purchase decision The first thing you ever take notice of in a smartphone is its design, followed by the feel of the device in your hands. The two are more or less synonymous with each other, with a poor design resulting in a sub-par handling experience. With the Xiaomi Redmi Y1, things are a little bit of a mixed bag. The Xiaomi Remi Y1 is unmistakably made of plastic, and not that super sturdy polycarbonate kind. The design is fairly generic, with a soft gold smooth finish on the back and a white bezel on the front. The only break in the design language is the singular 13-megapixel sensor on the back and a fingerprint sensor. The front, on the other hand, has the front-facing camera, an ambient light sensor and a soft LED flash, all in the form of three black circles. They do tend to stand out a little bit, but it’s not a deal breaker.  In terms of the quality of the phone, being made entirely of plastic, you do feel the materials by weight. The Xiaomi Redmi Y1 is fairly light for a 5.5-inch smartphone and while that’s a good thing, we do miss the metal finish of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4. While the design and build quality are fairly average, one point of contention we had was with the fit of the SIM card tray. The tray does not sit flush with the body like on most Android phones nowadays and unfortunately, does not lend any elegance to the design. If this phone is forever going to live in a case, then it’s not so much of an issue, but if you are going to be using it without protection, the SIM tray might look like an eye-sore to some. The price tag of Rs. 8,999 does not get your stellar build quality, and for the price, there are phones out there that have a better finish and use much better construction materials. The Xiaomi Redmi Y1 is the company’s first selfie-centric phone. It has a fairly standard 13-megapixel rear camera with PDAF and a single LED flash, but the front camera is a 16-megapixel shooter accompanied by a soft light LED. The primary camera shoots images that are average at best, with the weakest point being dynamic range. Don’t expect a perfect exposure if you’re shooting a subject in harsh light, however, if you are in more forgiving illumination such as indoors or outdoors during a cloudy day (or even shooting in shade) you should able to get good looking photos. One thing you shouldn’t expect out of these photos is a great level of detail as Xiaomi uses some very aggressive JPG compression algorithms. It was a little disappointing to take a photo of a beautiful flower and find very little detail in the texture of the leaves and petals. with what we’ve seen from other smartphones in this segment, where the Redmi Y1 sets itself apart is with the selfie camera. The soft light LED has only an arm’s reach worth of power, but it will get you that odd selfie in a pinch. What really did impress us was the selfie-focussed algorithms running in the background. Regardless of where you’re trying to take a selfie, once the camera locks onto your face (and it is very good at doing so) it prioritises the exposure of the face over the ambient conditions. In most cases, this is great, especially when you’re shooting selfies in harsh light, whether sunlight or even indoor, office lighting. The camera will also let you get creative with sun flare if you position it just right, without ruining the photo. The photos do lack texture detail, but given the obsession with the beautification of selfies, the skin comes out looking soft. As a selfie camera, the Redmi Y1 does impress in ways that it should. Our review unit of the Xiaomi Remi Y1 came preloaded with a beta build of MIUI 9, which is a result of Xiaomi’s own layer running on top of Android Nougat. MIUI 9 was announced the same day as the Redmi Y1, but it seems that the final version is yet to be rolled out. We did face minor hiccups on the Redmi Y1 in terms of performance, all of which could easily be attributed to the fact that our unit was running a beta build. Among the few things that worked well was the split-screen feature which didn’t stutter at all. The newly redesigned notification pane is also nice, but that would be a personal preference more than anything else. While most of the aspects of MIUI 9 worked smooth, there were some minor issues that can be attributed to the beta build of the OS. For starters, we occasionally faced issues with the keyboard not popping up for a few seconds. This problem was only intermittent and only presented itself arbitrarily. Occasionally the camera app would lock us out too, but it was again arbitrary and it is possible that all of this would go away once the final build of MIUI 9 is released for the Y1. Regardless of the changes, MIUI 9 is distinctly ‘Xiaomi’ and loyalists of the brand are right to be excited about this new OS. You still get a slew of customisation options and the themes app will give you access to innumerable themes for every design sensibility. MIUI 9 even in beta was fairly smooth, save for minor bugs here and there. Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor and 3GB of RAM, the Xiaomi Redmi Y1 isn’t the smartphone to offer the most cutting-edge specifications for the price bracket. The similarly-priced Xiaomi Redmi 4 (review) has the same specs as the Y1 or the most part as well, although, for a little more money, you could get yourself the Redmi Note 4 with the Snapdragon 625 processor.  Let’s just get the minor hiccups out of the way first. Our unit had a tough time keeping up with the fast-paced action of Injustice 2: Gods Amongst Us. Asphalt 8 saw a few minor frame drops as well, but games like Sonic Surge, Subway Surfers and even Angry Birds (if you’re still not over taking down those pigs) worked without a hitch. Casual gaming is no longer a problem even on seemingly less powerful components thanks to processors becoming more efficient and developers optimising many of their apps to work better on lower-end components.   In our time with the Xiaomi Redmi Y1, we noticed that apps by themselves work without any issues, save for the minor extended load times, but where we noticed problems was in the little things such as when the keyboard was supposed to pop up for typing a message. Occasionally, it would take the keyboard as long as three seconds to come up. Sometimes switching between apps lagged, but the instances of this were very few. Since this is a beta ROM, we’re sure Xiaomi will iron out the minor performance hiccups through an update. As a daily driver, the Xiaomi Y1 is not a bad choice. It just manages to keep things working well enough to not turn the user experience into a frustrating one. There were very few crashes (a total of three), although we did feel the need to close background apps every few hours. Surprisingly, despite running through the whole gamut of usage scenarios, we did not face any excessive heating of the device, which is a great sign.  The Xiaomi Redmi Y1 is powered by a 3,080mAh battery, a pretty standard number for most smartphones today. What you don’t get, however, is fast charging, which is a feature missing from this entire price bracket for the most part anyway.

It’s no secret that millennials often look up to OPPO and Vivo when purchasing a new selfie-focussed smartphone, as both the manufacturers have entire product lines dedicated to taking a user’s selfie experience to the next level. Despite Xiaomi offering more feature-packed offerings at comparable or even lower price points, the company has been facing stiff competition from the selfie-centric brands. Well, if you can’t beat ’em, join ’em right?  Last year, Xiaomi unveiled the Redmi Y1 smartphone (review) as part of its selfie-centric smartphone series in India. This year, the company is taking things to the next level by announcing the Redmi Y2, whose high-res selfie-shooter is backed by AI. But is the smartphone a one-trick pony, or is it an all-rounder which deserves to be in your pocket? I hope to answer that question in this review. Stay with me.  Design-wise, Xiaomi has gone with what’s worked for other manufacturers in the budget segment and has constructed the Redmi Y1 entirely out of plastic. My guess is this was done to reduce costs and truth be told, I didn’t really expect the company to use metal in the Y2’s build. However, using a sturdier polycarbonate back and playing with the design a bit isn’t a big ask as the Y2 looks quite generic. As a matter of fact, I made the mistake of confusing the Redmi Y2 with its pricier sibling, the Redmi Note 5 Pro (review) more than once, which is a testament to the smartphone’s uninspired design. This doesn’t necessarily mean that the smartphone is ugly – just a tad bit boring.  Now, while the Xiaomi Redmi Y2 will not impress your friends with its design, it surely will impress you with its in-hand feel. Despite being constructed out of plastic, the smartphone feels really durable in the hand. Moreover, thanks to its curved back, the handset offers a vice-like grip and I managed to go through my week-long review without dropping the smartphone even once – which is a feat in itself.  You’ll find the ports and buttons positioned at their usual spots, along with a fingerprint sensor present at the back. The sensor worked flawlessly during my testing, and I have no complaints in this department. The smartphone also lets you unlock it biometrically by means of facial recognition, though I found this to be a bit finicky and slow. Moreover, you’ll get a disclaimer while setting up face unlock on the Y2 stating that the feature can be manipulated by people or objects who look like you. A smartphone’s display is your window to the world and therefore, it’s one of the most important factors to consider in my books. As far as the Xiaomi Redmi Y2 is concerned, the smartphone ships with a bezel-less, 18:9 aspect ratio 5.99-inch display. The display bears a resolution of 720 x 1,440 pixels which puts the pixel density at 269ppi. Now, the display isn’t the sharpest of the lot, but I am satisfied with the panel’s quality and peak brightness levels. One thing I would like to mention is that the colours seem a bit washed out from the get-go. However, an easy fix for the same is to increase the display’s contrast levels from within the settings. The Xiaomi Redmi Y2 is a budget smartphone, albeit can give pricier mid-rangers a run for their money with its fast and consistent performance. Inside, the smartphone is driven by an octa-core Snapdragon 625 chip which works alongside 3GB of RAM and 32GB of user-expandable storage. Do note that there’s another variant that offers 4GB RAM and double the storage. My review unit is the one with 3GB RAM. Now, the SD625 processor is over a year old, but it still retains its spot as the most popular 600-series processor amongst manufacturers since it strikes the perfect balance between performance and efficiency. Allow me to explain.  My usage is pretty intense and I raise an eyebrow at the slightest jitter or lag, but to its credit, the Xiaomi Redmi Y2 didn’t falter even once during my testing period. Games like PUBG and Asphalt 8 ran without any major frame-dips on low to medium graphics settings and jumping between applications was a breeze too, despite my unit’s 3GB of RAM. The smartphone’s zippy performance goes on to show that Xiaomi cut the right corners by not equipping the smartphone with a full HD display, which would’ve required more processing power to function. Equipping the smartphone with a relatively low-res panel worked wonders for its battery life too and I was regularly hitting the bed at night with around 30 percent of juice still left in the smartphone’s 3,000mAh tank.googletag. Consumers investing in an entry-level smartphone are often left at the whim of the manufacturer to get software updates. In fact, you’ll be hard-pressed to find many phones under Rs 10K which boot the latest version of Android from the get-go. Well, Xiaomi is breaking the mould and has equipped with Redmi Y2 with Android Oreo v8.1. The company’s custom MIUI platform is there of course, though I don’t have any complaints against it. On the contrary, MIUI is constantly getting better and the latest version felt a lot snappier than its previous iterations. Moreover, I’m quite happy that Xiaomi has limited the bloat on the device to a minimum, thereby giving users more storage to install the apps they want.  Now, if you’re going to go hunting for new features on the latest iteration of the skin, let me save you some trouble because there aren’t any. However, that’s not really a bad thing as MIUI already comes loaded with a bunch of useful tricks up its sleeves, such as the ability to use multiple accounts for apps like WhatsApp and a feature-rich theme store. The Xiaomi Redmi Y2 isn’t the first affordable smartphone from the company to ship with dual cameras, but it is the first in the brand’s Y-series lineup. The handset comes with dual 12MP and 5MP sensors on the back, which look identical to the ones found on the pricier Redmi Note 5 Pro, at least on paper. Unfortunately, we have no way to ascertain this as the company is keeping a tight lip about the type of sensor the smartphone employs to click images. That being said, Xiaomi is targeting the selfie-centric demographic with the Redmi Y2 and therefore, has equipped the smartphone with a generous 16MP shooter up front. As far as the Y2’s camera prowess is concerned, I wasn’t too impressed with the smartphone’s dual-camera setup at the back. I did keep my expectations in check as the Redmi Y2 is a budget smartphone at the end of the day. Unfortunately, almost all the images I clicked with the smartphone’s primary camera setup had washed-out colours. The smartphone did manage to capture a satisfactory amount of details every time I pressed the shutter button, but I had to take multiple shots of the same subject as the device took its time to focus properly. Thankfully, the smartphone’s built-in HDR mode does a really good job at boosting the contrast levels and colours in images so I left it turned on for the duration of my review period. Surprisingly enough, I was really impressed with the smartphone’s performance in lowlight scenarios and you can easily get a good, detailed picture of the subject if you shoot with the flash enabled. I click a ton of selfies every day and therefore, I am always on the lookout for a smartphone with a good selfie camera. While my quest to find the perfect selfie-phone doesn’t end with the Redmi Y2, it still is a fantastic device to click self-portraits with. The pictures I clicked had ample details and good colour reproduction. Moreover, thanks to the presence of a dedicated flash module upfront, the quality of selfies doesn’t take a huge dip at night either.  AI has become the talking point for most devices launched this year and the Xiaomi Redmi Y2 is no different. Much like smartphones from OPPO and Vivo, the Redmi Y2 also makes use of AI to beautify selfies correctly. Consequently, I noticed that the built-in beauty mode did a great job at removing any blemishes and pimples without making the skin tone seem unnatural.  The 3GB RAM variant of the Xiaomi Redmi Y2 costs Rs 9,999 whereas the 4GB RAM variant will set interested folks back by Rs 12,999. For the price, the Xiaomi Redmi Y2 is an excellent bang for the buck device which offers solid performance, good battery life, and a stunning selfie camera. Now, if you don’t prefer the smartphone’s HD+ display, then I’ll suggest you opt for the Redmi Note 5 (review) instead, which also retails for a similar price albeit comes with a sharper display and a bigger battery. Everything considered, Xiaomi has yet again upped the ante for the competition in the budget segment with the Redmi Y2."

2491,30,33614,3.5,5,2019-04-24,,33614,Prateek Pandey -,"Xiaomi Redmi Y3 review: smile, pout, repeat",https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/xiaomi-redmi-y3-review?pid=33614," “Our hot take on Redmi’s latest smartphone – the Y3Although OPPO and Vivo were among the first brands to capitalise on the selfie craze, other OEMs quickly caught up to speed by launching their own versions of selfie-centric phones. Xiaomi jumped on the bandwagon with its selfie-focussed Redmi Y series of smartphones a while back in India. I reviewed the company’s Redmi Y2 smartphone and was mighty impressed with the handset’s capabilities. Can then, the recently unveiled Redmi Y3 fill its shoes? To answer that question, I slapped my primary SIM inside the Redmi Y3 and after testing it for a week, here’s what I make of it. Remember how gradient-finish designs were limited to premium flagships not so long ago? Well, thanks to the combined efforts from brands like Redmi and Realme, budget-conscious buyers can now enjoy flattering finishes on their smartphones too. The Redmi Y3 is a fantastic example of the same as the device dons a gorgeous bluish motif towards the back which, at an angle, exhibits different colours of a rainbow. Now, granted, you’ll spend a good chunk of your time wiping down the back of the device as it smudges really easily. Still, it’s hard not to be impressed with the smartphone’s stunning design, especially given its wallet-friendly price point.  What’s more, although the handset has been constructed in entirety using plastic, it feels surprisingly luxurious and well-built. There’s absolutely no flex in or around the chassis, the display melts seamlessly into the handset’s frame and the physical buttons are adequately tactile too. Furthermore, the edges of the device have been chamfered, ensuring they don’t bite your palms and the handset’s curvy back allows you to grip it firmly too. Redmi has even paid heed to the fine details such as keeping the camera bump to a minimum and placing the fingerprint sensor at an ergonomic position. Everything considered, the company has hit the ball out of the ballpark with the Y3’s design and I’m confident buyers opting for the device will enjoy flaunting and handling the phone just as much as I did As I mentioned a second ago, the Redmi Y3 ships with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor which, in my experience, worked flawlessly. The sensor was quick to register my fingerprint and unlocked the device in a jiffy. You can also use face unlock for authentication, which worked just as well, albeit had a slightly jarring system animation. However, the tech is quite secure, and it didn’t unlock the phone when my eyes were closed.  The Redmi Y3 ships with a micro-USB port for charging, which usually would’ve triggered me into writing a rant. However, considering the smartphone’s price point, I’d say it’s a reasonable compromise. Thankfully, you do get a headphone jack with the device, along with an IR blaster which is one of the most underrated features of Xiaomi phones. I can’t even recount how often I used the Mi Remote app to control the AC or the TV in my room and I hope to see more widespread adoption of this feature.Coming to the display, the Redmi Y3 ships with a 6.26-inch, dot notch, HD+ panel. The display is decent for the price, but I noticed it didn’t get very bright. Consequently, using the smartphone outdoors was a chore, and I had to squint my eyes or cover the top of the phone with my hand to see the information on the display. Moreover, the handset lacks support for Widevine L1, and consequently, you’ll be limited to streaming SD content from services like Netflix.  Before I talk about the smartphone’s cameras and performance, you should know that I didn’t face any problems with the Y3 in the connectivity department. The smartphone connected and offered 4G speeds from my service provider (Airtel) perfectly. I did find the in-call volume to be a bit low, though the handset’s microphone relayed my voice over to the other end clearly. You’ll also get a tiny notification LED towards the bottom of the phone, which lights up when you’re charging the device or receiving notifications. The Redmi Y3’s claim to fame is its 32MP front-facing camera, which makes use of Samsung’s GD1 sensor. As it stands, only a handful of devices in the country sport the sensor, including the Huawei P30 Pro, which is much, much more expensive than the Y3. Now, I click a lot of selfies as it is and naturally, I was excited to take the selfie shooter out for a spin. And, after a week of clicking photos with the phone, I must say, I’m not disappointed in the slightest.  Photos I clicked with the device’s front-facing camera during the day had ample details and vibrant colours. As I mentioned previously, I took the device with me on a trip to Agra, which at this time of the year, is bright and sunny. Consequently, I was able to get away with some of the most detailed selfies I’ve ever seen on a smartphone. What’s more, with the HDR mode turned on, the Y3’s selfie shooter was able to resolve the details in overexposed shots too.To give you a better picture (no pun intended), here’s a comparison of the smartphone’s selfie prowess with and without the HDR mode turned on. As can be clearly seen, the blue colour in the sky, as well as the green in the leaves, is much clearer with HDR on.I was also quite impressed with the selfie shooter’s ability to click near-perfect portrait shots. Even with a lot of people in the background, the Y3’s front-camera retained its focus on my face and managed to create a convincing blur effect. Now, granted, it is a tad bit rough around the edges and the shooter struggled to separate parts of my ears from the background. But, given the Y3’s low price point, I am willing to give the smartphone a pass on this one.if (window.matchMedia('(min-width: 900px)').matches) { var googletag = googletag || {}; googletag.cmd = googletag.cmd || [];  googletag.cmd.push(function() {googletag.defineSlot('/10578778/Hub_RB_728x90', [728, 90], 'div-gpt-ad-1493810631751-0_3').addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.pubads().collapseEmptyDivs(); googletag.enableServices();  });  document.write(""<div id='div-gpt-ad-1493810631751-0_3' style='height:90px; width:728px;margin: 0 auto;margin-bottom: 20px;'>""); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1493810631751-0_3'); }); document.write(""</div>""); }  If you’re into beautifying your selfies, then you’ll get a ton of options on the Redmi Y3, including the ability to change your skin tone and smoothen out the blemishes. However, since I prefer more natural-looking portraits, I turned the feature off. Moreover, much like most other devices in the market, the Redmi Y3 also offers a built-in screen flash functionality which should get you a decent image at night. That said, you’ll miss out on the details in the background if you opt to use the feature.   While the Redmi Y3’s 32MP front camera is among the best in its class, the performance of the smartphone’s rear cameras is nothing to write home about. The device ships with a pair of 12MP and 2MP sensors on the back, which click good photos when it’s sunny outdoors. The images I shot with the device had plenty of details, exhibited natural colours and with the HDR turned on, I could see noticeably more details in the highlights and the shadows. On the whole, the picture quality was on par with the competition, so you’ll find little to complain here. Unfortunately, owing to the lens’ relatively smaller f/2.2 aperture, the image quality took a hit when it was dark outdoors. In fact, the Realme 3 (review), which ships with an f/1.8 aperture lens, had lesser grain and noise as compared to Redmi Y3. Consequently, while you’ll be able to click good photos with the Y3 during the day, you’ll have to be a bit more selective as to where you use the camera at night. It’s baffling how good affordable phones have become, especially in the performance department. Nowadays, most wallet-friendly options ship with a speedy mid-tier chip from either Qualcomm or MediaTek’s stables, which was unheard of a few years ago. The Redmi Y3 features Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 632 chip which works alongside either 3GB or 4GB of RAM. Correspondingly, you’ll get either 32GB or 64GB of built-in, user-expandable storage.   Now, having used the phone for the better part of a week, I can tell you that I don’t have any major issues with the smartphone’s performance. The device zipped through resource hungry applications like Instagram and I could even play intensive games like PUBG on the phone, albeit at lower graphics settings. That said, if you’re the type to juggle between multiple applications, then you’ll want to buy the 4GB RAM variant of the device.  You see, my review unit – which shipped with 3GB of RAM – struggled to keep multiple applications open in memory. That could be in part due to the smartphone’s custom skin, which sucks up a fair bit of the system’s resources. Therefore, even with just a handful of apps in memory, I often had to wait for Apple Music to bring up my playlist from scratch, or reload a webpage on Google Chrome.  Coming to the smartphone’s software, I must admit, I’m not the biggest fan of the device’s custom skin. While Xiaomi’s MIUI has come a long way, it’s littered with ads and between the promoted apps section in folders and the built-in app scanner which suggests different apps to install every time you download one from the Play Store, I was irrevocably irked with the device’s UI. Thankfully, you can turn the ad pop-ups off.  That said, not all is grim and gloomy with the company’s custom skin. In fact, there are a fair bit of useful utilities which come bundled with MIUI, such as the ability to choose how big of a display you want when you’re using the smartphone’s one-hand mode, gesture-based navigation, the option to theme your device and so on and so forth.  You can even open two instances of applications like WhatsApp and Facebook, create a second space to protect your personal data, or tweak the EQ as per your liking when you connect a pair of headphones to the phone. Everything considered, MIUI does have quite a few nifty features, but the user experience can be improved a bit.  As far as the battery life of the smartphone is concerned, the Redmi Y3 ships with a beefy 4,000mAh battery which comfortably saw me through the end of the day on heavy usage. On my recent trip to Agra, I used the device intensively to click photos, share updates on various social media platforms, use maps to navigate my way around the city and listen to music. Despite that, I ended the day with at least 20 percent battery still in the tank. Much to my surprise, the handset didn’t last very long in our battery drain test, where it managed to play a looping video for 15 hours. The Redmi Y3 starts at Rs 9,999 (Rs 11,999 for the 4GB variant), and for the price, the handset offers a stunning design, good battery life, an incredible selfie camera, and decent performance. Provided the first thing you do when you wake up is take a selfie, you’ll feel right at home with the Redmi Y3.  If not, then you’ll find no shortage of better, more well-rounded options than the Y3. For instance, you could instead opt for the Realme 3, which retails for Rs 1K less and offers a much better CPU and more capable rear cameras. Moreover, you can also opt for the Redmi Note 7 (review), which retails for the same price as the Y3 but offers better performance, cameras, design and display to boot.  In conclusion, the Redmi Y3 may not appeal to everyone, but delivers where it matters the most and comes out as the best selfie phone in its price segment. "
