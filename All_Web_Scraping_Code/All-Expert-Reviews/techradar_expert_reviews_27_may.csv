Despite featuring a plastic back and sides, it feels richer than the pricier Samsung Galaxy A7, and looks better too. While it can't compete with the A7's OLED screen in terms of quality, the Honor 10 Lite's smaller bezels makes it a more striking package.The phone has plenty of storage too. Most phones in this price range feature just 32GB storage, but the 10 Lite gives users a generous 64GB, of which about 50GB is available to the user.This is a mid-range phone with mid-range power, courtesy of a Kirin 710 processor paired with 3GB RAM. The upshot is less power-hungry internals that put less pressure on the sizeable 3400mAh battery.Design Plastic back and sides Glass front with pre-fitted screen protector Protective case in the boxThe Honor 10 Lite is a great-looking mid-range smartphone.In the box you get a clear case to keep your phone protected, and there's a screen protector pre-fitted as well, to stave off superficial screen damage.At 8mm thick and 162g, the 10 Lite is indeed light, owing largely to its plastic body. The sides sport a chrome effect and feel really nice in the hand – smooth, without being too slippery. As for the back, it looks like glass, and feels like it too, even sporting an ergonomic, premium glass-like curve. Be warned though: it's plastic – and plastic scratches much more easily than glass, so if you’re picking up an Honor 10 Lite, get the case on before you slip it in your pocket.There are plenty of color options here: Sky Blue, Midnight Black and Sapphire Blue, with some options sporting a gradient finish, as introduced on the Huawei P20 Pro and carried over to the Mate 20.The rear fingerprint scanner is in the middle of the phone and easy to hit, with the ridged edges easily identified when extending a digit.There are two cameras on the rear – again, not too bad for the price – and they’re slightly raised from the body. While camera bumps aren’t great, when you put the included case on the 10 Lite both case and lenses are relatively flush, so the bump becomes unnoticeable.On the bottom of the phone are a single downwards-firing speaker, a microUSB connection and a headphone jack. It’s easy to miss unless it’s flashing, but Honor has managed to squeeze a notification light in below the screen which is both handy and unexpected given how small the bezels are, rounding off the look and feel of this excellently priced package very nicely.Screen 19.5:9 LCD screen with water drop notch 6.21 inches with a 83% screen-to-body ratio Full HD Plus resolution, 415ppi Appropriately for a phone of the 10 Lite's price, Honor has decided against a QHD screen, instead opting for a Full HD display. It's long, with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio, and it’s also very light on bezels, with what Honor claims to be an almost 90% screen-to-bezel ratio. The resolution of 2230 x 1080 pixels is competitive. It means the phone has a resolution of 415 pixels-per-inch, bettering the significantly pricier iPhone XR’s 326ppi. It might lack the overall image quality you’d get with an OLED display on a Samsung or Apple handset, but given the price difference we can’t say we missed elements such as HDR. Off-angle and outdoor view-ability are better than we’d expect from a phone of this price too, and it’s easy to see the screen in all but the brightest conditions.The fact that the screen extends closer to the edges of the display is going to attract a few users, and to that end there’s no traditional notch at the top, just a small protrusion, also known as a water drop or teardrop notch, which houses the 24MP selfie camera.Another bonus is that within the settings are plenty of screen calibration tools. Eye Comfort mode, color calibration and more give you control over everything from the screen tone to its emission of blue light, which can interfere with sleep.",Honor 10 Lite review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/honor-10-lite-review,Basil Kronfli

All of that wrapped up in an attractive price tag makes the 7C worth checking out.Honor 7C price and availabilityLaunch price: £169.99Release date: May 2018The Honor 7C launch price was £169.99 SIM free, which placed it in a highly affordable part of the market.In the UK, the Honor 7C is only available through the firm's own website, hihonor.co.uk.DesignHonor 7C specsWeight: 164gDimensions: 158.3 x 76.7 x 7.8mmOS: Android 8.0Screen size: 5.99-inchResolution: 720 x 1440CPU: Snapdragon 450RAM: 3/4GBStorage: 32/64GBBattery: 3,000mAhRear camera: 13MP + 2MPFront camera: 8MPHonor says it focused on making sure the 7C feels really good in the hand, with a 360 degree circular, symmetrical design for the phone.The phone looks sleek, and at 7.8mm thick it sits well in the hand with the rounded edges helping to provide a comfortable fit.While the 7C has a metal rear, it's just a thin sheet of metal attached to a plastic frame. This keeps the weight of the handset down, useful considering the large screen size, but it does mean it doesn't feel premium in the hand.It is solid however, and the build quality is good. There are easy to reach power/lock and volume keys on the right of the phone, while a 3-in-1 tray on the left can accommodate two SIM cards and a microSD card.There's good news for audio fans as Honor has opted to keep the 3.5mm headphone jack on the base of the handset, and it lines up alongside a single speaker and a microUSB port.Honor 7C hands on galleryImage 1 of 8Image 2 of 8Image 3 of 8Image 4 of 8Image 5 of 8Image 6 of 8Image 7 of 8Image 8 of 8It's a shame not to see a USB-C connection here as it's now the more dominant connection type, but it's not the end of the world.There's a rear fingerprint scanner included too, which is a handy addition when it comes to biometric security, but that's only half the story.That's because Honor has also built in Face unlock into the handset, or it will do when the feature arrives via an OTA (over the air) update, which is expected to land in May.The Honor 7C we got hands on with did have the Face Unlock feature installed, and we were impressed by just how quickly it was able to recognize us. It takes less than a second to recognize and unlock, and Honor claims it's faster than Face ID on the iPhone X.It was also quick and easy to set up, with the phone recording 1024 different facial points and saving them in an encrypted local trust zone on the device which isn't accessible to the outside world.The Honor 7C will be available in two colors, black and blue.DisplayThe Honor 7C has a huge 5.99-inch FullView display with an 18:9 aspect ratio. That means it's taller than the more traditional 16:9 panels, and this aspect ratio is becoming more and more popular with all manufacturers.With no front facing fingerprint scanner, and navigation keys on screen, it's allowed Honor to further reduce the bezels above and below the display, allowing the screen to take up the majority of the front of the phone.It's bright and clear, but with its HD+ resolution (1440 x 720) it's not as pin sharp as we'd like from a screen this size.That said, this isn't an expensive phone so we can accept the fact it 'only' has a 720p resolution, and you're still getting a lot of screen here for the price.Power and softwareUnder the hood the Honor 7C has a Snapdragon 450 octa-core chipset, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage in the UK, although some countries will get a 4GB/64GB varaint.While the chipset is an entry-level offering, paired with the RAM there's enough power to keep things running. There is a slight lag when opening apps, but nothing we wouldn't expect from a phone in the 7C's price bracket.That power is tasked with running Android 8 Oreo - the latest version of Google's mobile operating system - although it's not the stock software.The Honor 7C comes with parent company Hauwei's EMUI interface overlay, which removes the app drawer and changes the theme of Android.While the interface may not be to everyone's taste, it allows Honor to add some additional features. There's a gaming mode that can hide notifications and provides a small pop up for calls during game play, so not to ruin your flow, while synergy music allows you to sync up to nine handsets to play a song through all their speakers and karaoke mode lets you project your singing voice through the phone's speaker.CameraThe dual rear facing cameras are one of the main attractions of the Honor 7C, with 13MP and 2MP sensors sitting side by side.The 2MP camera is in charge of capturing depth data for the Bokeh mode, allowing you to take photos with a blurred background, while your subject in the foreground is nicely in focus.We had a quick play with the camera on the Honor 7C and found it to be generally capable, although it's not going to blow you away with quality. The Bokeh mode worked reasonable well, but the overall image seemed to lack a little bit of definition.Round the front the 8MP camera is accompanied by Honor's smart soft light LED, allowing you to illuminate your selfies in low light.The LED has three levels of adjustment, allowing you choose just how illuminated you are. We didn't have a particularly dark environment during our hands on time with the phone to try this out, but we'll be sure to put the front and rear cameras to the test in our in-depth review.Early verdictThe Honor 7C offers face unlock, dual rear cameras and a big screen on a serious budget, and that makes it an interesting handset.It's great to see features filter down price tiers, and Honor is leading the charge at the budget end of the market with the 7C.

All of that wrapped up in an attractive price tag makes the 7C worth checking out.Honor 7C price and availabilityLaunch price: £169.99Release date: May 2018The Honor 7C launch price was £169.99 SIM free, which placed it in a highly affordable part of the market.In the UK, the Honor 7C is only available through the firm's own website, hihonor.co.uk.DesignHonor 7C specsWeight: 164gDimensions: 158.3 x 76.7 x 7.8mmOS: Android 8.0Screen size: 5.99-inchResolution: 720 x 1440CPU: Snapdragon 450RAM: 3/4GBStorage: 32/64GBBattery: 3,000mAhRear camera: 13MP + 2MPFront camera: 8MPHonor says it focused on making sure the 7C feels really good in the hand, with a 360 degree circular, symmetrical design for the phone.The phone looks sleek, and at 7.8mm thick it sits well in the hand with the rounded edges helping to provide a comfortable fit.While the 7C has a metal rear, it's just a thin sheet of metal attached to a plastic frame. This keeps the weight of the handset down, useful considering the large screen size, but it does mean it doesn't feel premium in the hand.It is solid however, and the build quality is good. There are easy to reach power/lock and volume keys on the right of the phone, while a 3-in-1 tray on the left can accommodate two SIM cards and a microSD card.There's good news for audio fans as Honor has opted to keep the 3.5mm headphone jack on the base of the handset, and it lines up alongside a single speaker and a microUSB port.Honor 7C hands on galleryImage 1 of 8Image 2 of 8Image 3 of 8Image 4 of 8Image 5 of 8Image 6 of 8Image 7 of 8Image 8 of 8It's a shame not to see a USB-C connection here as it's now the more dominant connection type, but it's not the end of the world.There's a rear fingerprint scanner included too, which is a handy addition when it comes to biometric security, but that's only half the story.That's because Honor has also built in Face unlock into the handset, or it will do when the feature arrives via an OTA (over the air) update, which is expected to land in May.The Honor 7C we got hands on with did have the Face Unlock feature installed, and we were impressed by just how quickly it was able to recognize us. It takes less than a second to recognize and unlock, and Honor claims it's faster than Face ID on the iPhone X.It was also quick and easy to set up, with the phone recording 1024 different facial points and saving them in an encrypted local trust zone on the device which isn't accessible to the outside world.The Honor 7C will be available in two colors, black and blue.DisplayThe Honor 7C has a huge 5.99-inch FullView display with an 18:9 aspect ratio. That means it's taller than the more traditional 16:9 panels, and this aspect ratio is becoming more and more popular with all manufacturers.With no front facing fingerprint scanner, and navigation keys on screen, it's allowed Honor to further reduce the bezels above and below the display, allowing the screen to take up the majority of the front of the phone.It's bright and clear, but with its HD+ resolution (1440 x 720) it's not as pin sharp as we'd like from a screen this size.That said, this isn't an expensive phone so we can accept the fact it 'only' has a 720p resolution, and you're still getting a lot of screen here for the price.Power and softwareUnder the hood the Honor 7C has a Snapdragon 450 octa-core chipset, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage in the UK, although some countries will get a 4GB/64GB varaint.While the chipset is an entry-level offering, paired with the RAM there's enough power to keep things running. There is a slight lag when opening apps, but nothing we wouldn't expect from a phone in the 7C's price bracket.That power is tasked with running Android 8 Oreo - the latest version of Google's mobile operating system - although it's not the stock software.The Honor 7C comes with parent company Hauwei's EMUI interface overlay, which removes the app drawer and changes the theme of Android.While the interface may not be to everyone's taste, it allows Honor to add some additional features. There's a gaming mode that can hide notifications and provides a small pop up for calls during game play, so not to ruin your flow, while synergy music allows you to sync up to nine handsets to play a song through all their speakers and karaoke mode lets you project your singing voice through the phone's speaker.CameraThe dual rear facing cameras are one of the main attractions of the Honor 7C, with 13MP and 2MP sensors sitting side by side.The 2MP camera is in charge of capturing depth data for the Bokeh mode, allowing you to take photos with a blurred background, while your subject in the foreground is nicely in focus.We had a quick play with the camera on the Honor 7C and found it to be generally capable, although it's not going to blow you away with quality. The Bokeh mode worked reasonable well, but the overall image seemed to lack a little bit of definition.Round the front the 8MP camera is accompanied by Honor's smart soft light LED, allowing you to illuminate your selfies in low light.The LED has three levels of adjustment, allowing you choose just how illuminated you are. We didn't have a particularly dark environment during our hands on time with the phone to try this out, but we'll be sure to put the front and rear cameras to the test in our in-depth review.Early verdictThe Honor 7C offers face unlock, dual rear cameras and a big screen on a serious budget, and that makes it an interesting handset.It's great to see features filter down price tiers, and Honor is leading the charge at the budget end of the market with the 7C.

There is a slight lag when opening apps, but nothing we wouldn't expect from a phone in the 7C's price bracket.That power is tasked with running Android 8 Oreo - the latest version of Google's mobile operating system - although it's not the stock software.The Honor 7C comes with parent company Hauwei's EMUI interface overlay, which removes the app drawer and changes the theme of Android.While the interface may not be to everyone's taste, it allows Honor to add some additional features. There's a gaming mode that can hide notifications and provides a small pop up for calls during game play, so not to ruin your flow, while synergy music allows you to sync up to nine handsets to play a song through all their speakers and karaoke mode lets you project your singing voice through the phone's speaker.CameraThe dual rear facing cameras are one of the main attractions of the Honor 7C, with 13MP and 2MP sensors sitting side by side.The 2MP camera is in charge of capturing depth data for the Bokeh mode, allowing you to take photos with a blurred background, while your subject in the foreground is nicely in focus.We had a quick play with the camera on the Honor 7C and found it to be generally capable, although it's not going to blow you away with quality. The Bokeh mode worked reasonable well, but the overall image seemed to lack a little bit of definition.Round the front the 8MP camera is accompanied by Honor's smart soft light LED, allowing you to illuminate your selfies in low light.The LED has three levels of adjustment, allowing you choose just how illuminated you are. We didn't have a particularly dark environment during our hands on time with the phone to try this out, but we'll be sure to put the front and rear cameras to the test in our in-depth review.Early verdictThe Honor 7C offers face unlock, dual rear cameras and a big screen on a serious budget, and that makes it an interesting handset.It's great to see features filter down price tiers, and Honor is leading the charge at the budget end of the market with the 7C. If you're funds are limited, this is a phone that should be worth considering.The even more budget Honor 7A has also been announced",Hands on: Honor 7C review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/honor-7c-hands-on,John McCann

A subtle two-tone band stops it from being plain black, but it took us a while to even notice this was the case.This phone may be two-tone, but those two tones are shades of black.The Honor 8X also feels less dense and expensive than the iPhone XS. Considering the radical price difference, if this was not the case it would seem odd.Honor’s use of a micro USB port instead of a USB-C is the one hardware niggle that sticks out. Value-packed as the Honor 8X is, this price band is USB-C territory in 2018.There’s no official water resistance either, but the Honor 8X is not without extras. The rear fingerprint scanner is very fast and reliable, and 64GB of storage is great at the price. There are spaces for an extra nanoSIM card and microSD card in the SIM tray too, earning it a few extra tech nerd points.The ultra-slim screen surrounds also make the Honor 8X pleasant to use and hold for a phone with a 6.5-inch screen. This is not just for enthusiasts and those with big hands. Like just about every Honor phone, it’s slim too at 7.8mm thick.The factory-applied screen protector is a nice additional touch, although within a few days one part had started to lift off the surface.Approach the Honor 8X with an ultra-critical eye and you can tell this is not an ultra-premium mobile. Build is a small step below the OnePlus 6 too. However, as is so often the case, Honor has done a brilliant job of making a phone comparable to one double the price.Screen6.5-inch 19.5:9 LCD screen, 1080 x 2340 pixelsNotch, which can be hiddenCustomizable color profileThe Honor 8X has a large, very tall 6.5-inch 19.5:9 LCD screen with a fairly narrow notch. Notch-haters can block off the top area with a black bar too.Fresh out of the box the Honor 8X uses a slightly unruly 'vivid' color mode, one not quite as tasteful as that of more expensive phones. Some tones look more sickly than vivid, but switch to 'normal' color mode and you have one of the very best displays you’ll find in a phone for under $400/£400.Color looks accurate enough and well saturated, and as the Honor 8X has an ultra-long Full HD-grade resolution, with 1080 x 2340 pixels, it’s sharp too. It is sharper than the iPhone XR: amusing when you compare their prices.The sheer size of the display makes the Honor 8X seem a true enthusiast phone, well-suited to gaming, video streaming and reading long articles or even books.Top brightness is not as high as that of the phones Honor references with the 8X, phones over $600/£600. However, it is legible on bright days so covers the essentials for a mid-range model.",,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/honor-8x,Andrew Williams

It requires serious all-round balance of everything to beat such competition. So, does the Honor 9 Lite 4GB variant have the all-round balance one is looking for? Let’s find out in this review. Honor 9 Lite price and release dateHonor 9 Lite launch prices start from Rs 10,999Honor 9 Lite specsWeight: 149gDimensions:  151 x 71.9 x 7.6mm OS: EMUI 8.0 (Android 8.0 Oreo)Screen size: 5.65 inchesResolution: 1080 x 2160 (18:9 aspect ratio)CPU: Kirin 659RAM: 3GB/4GBStorage: 32GB/64GBBattery: 3,000mAhRear camera: 13MP + 2MPFront camera: 13MP + 2MPThe price for the Honor 9 Lite in India starts from Rs 10,999 for the 32GB variant while users will have to shell out Rs 14,999 for the 64GB variant.

Although the variant we have tested comes at Rs 14,999, but the design remains the same on both. The phone follows a similar design as the Honor 9. It has a same glass and metal design language with curved edges. It has no physical navigation buttons on the body, but the round fingerprint sensor is on the back.The blue variant of the phone looks stunning with that sleek and shiny finish. But glass, as always, is prone to smudges and scratches. So, you have to keep cleaning up your phone to keep it neat.There's a 2.5D curved glass baked on the front and back, which subtly blends with the curve on the sides.

If you look at current phones in this range, you'll probably end up calling the 9 Lite the best among all. But if you are someone who's not fond of blingy design and like it simple, then your opinion might differ. Overall, it is a good design to flaunt without spending a lot. It feels solid, key placement makes sense, and all the ports are in place. It has dual-cameras on the back and front.Huawei has done a great job in cramming a 5.65-inch display in a limited space, which automatically chops off extra bezels around the display.

It fits 428 pixels per inch in that 18:9 display, which is the reason why details appear sharp and distinctive.To my surprise, the display produced accurate whites unlike most Honor phones, where display is shadowed by a blue tint. The display offers 570nits of luminescence, which results in great sunlight legibility for a phone of this range. Since it is an IPS LCD panel, it does not match up to the brightness and depth of contrast on an AMOLED panel. It allows you to downscale the resolution to 720p, and you can also tweak color temperature accordingly. The only issue with 18:9 displays is app compatibility. Most apps and content are available for 16:9 displays, but you can enable full screen from settings to stretch the content.

30,,2019-04-23T15:33:38Z,Fyk3f8c8af66aGkBXUWf8M,"Apple's iPhone 8 wasn't even the top-of-the-line iOS phone  when it came out, but it's still a solid pick for functionality and speed, with a traditional home button packing an easy-to-use Touch ID fingerprint sensor to boot. In short, it's as powerful as the iPhone X at a notably lower cost.If you're hunting for the best iPhone right now, consider the flagship iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max (as well as the slightly cheaper iPhone XR) - but be warned. They are expensive, and there's no home button or fingerprint scanner, meaning you'd have to rely on Face ID for biometrics.The 8 is a legacy iPhone through and through: if you've owned an Apple handset from the iPhone 6 onwards, you'll know exactly what you're getting with this smartphone. There haven't been too many differences over the last few years, but for some, that's a bonus.Update: Apple has updated the iPhone 8 to iOS 12.2 and we've updated this review to reflect that, as well as adding the iPhone XR to the competition section.iPhone pessimists and Android fans (sometimes the same people) will be quick to point out the seemingly minor incremental upgrades over 2016's iPhone 7, but for those with an iPhone 6S or before that's less of a problem.While it may not offer much over its direct predecessor, the iPhone 8 has enough about it to make it an exciting upgrade for those with older iPhone handsets. It also runs the new iOS 12 software without a hitch.Read our reviews: iPhone 8 Plus | iPhone XS | iPhone XS Max | iPhone XRiPhone 8 vs iPhone XSApple hasn't reinvented the wheel here – if you're craving innovation (within the iPhone bubble, at least) see the new iPhone XS (which has replaced the iPhone X).You've probably already heard, but the differences between these two phones is pretty vast - and the first point is the cost. The iPhone XS starts at $999 / £999 / AU$1,579 if you want the 64GB model, where the iPhone 8 now starts at $599 / £599 / AU$979 for the same capacity.The iPhone XSSo what are you getting for that extra money - and is it worth buying? The first thing is the screen - you've got a bezel-less 5.8-inch display with a 1,125 x 2,436 resolution, and it's OLED display technology too – that's superior to the 4.7-inch 750 x 1,334 screen on the iPhone 8. You'll notice a huge difference between the two. The other big difference to consider is how you unlock this phone - with the iPhone 8, it's Touch ID fingerprint scanning, as it has been for years. With the iPhone XS, you're unlocking with your face, using the nattily-named Face ID. Touch ID is familiar and fast, while Face ID feels futuristic and recognize faces fast enough – but it's not going to be for everyone doesn't adjust well to drastic change. For those people, the iPhone 8 is going to be far more appealing.The notch at the top of the iPhone XS contains a camera that allows for Animoji and MeMoji, where emoji can be animated by mapping your face - this feature is locked to the iPhone X, XS, XS Max and XR, and the TrueDepth front camera, so not possible to do on the iPhone 8.The iPhone XS has dual cameras where the iPhone 8 has a single sensor, which allows for background de-focus and a more comprehensive photographic experience - although this is also possible on the iPhone 8 Plus.In short: the iPhone 8 is the safe, cheaper option. It does the iPhone things you'd want, and is a solid package you'll recognize all the way back to the iPhone 6.iPhone 8 price and availabilityiPhone 8 price (64GB): $599 (£599, AU$979)iPhone 8 price (256GB): $749 (£749, AU$1,229) Launch price (64GB): $699 (£699, AU$1,079) Launch price (256GB): $849 (£849, AU$1,329) iPhone 8 release date: September 22, 2017 The iPhone 8 set a new bar in terms of cost for Apple's most mainstream handset, as it upped its launch price tag once again.While the iPhone 8 price at launch was $699 (£699, AU$1,079) for 64GB of storage and  $849 (£849, AU$1,329), it has since dropped.The iPhone 8 price now starts at $599 (£599, AU$979) for the 64GB model, and rises to $749 (£749, $1,229) for the 256GB variant. For the best UK contracts, check out our iPhone 8 deals page.Even though Apple has launched three new iPhones since the iPhone 8's arrival, the handset is still widely available from Apple itself and most major phone retailers.Design Glass rear looks and feels great, and enables wireless charging  Front still bezel-heavy and almost identical to past three generations The iPhone 8 marked the most radical change in iPhone design for three years – but don’t get too excited.One of the big upgrades Apple has given its new iPhone, and the focus of the design, is the  glass rear – it’s an upgrade over the aluminium body used since the iPhone 5, and its inclusion means a brand-new feature in the shape of wireless charging.However, in terms of size, shape and look the iPhone 8 uses the same form factor as the iPhone 7, 6S and 6, and from the front it’s almost impossible to differentiate between the four generations of handsets.The iPhone 8 is a fraction of a millimeter thicker (7.3mm vs 7.1mm), wider (67.3mm vs 67.1mm) and taller (138.4mm vs 138.3mm) than the iPhone 7, but you won’t notice. The point we’re making is that it’s similar... very, very similar.It’s heavier too, an extra 10g over the iPhone 7, which may be a little more noticeable – but it’s not overbearing, and we were still able to comfortably hold the phone in our palm.The ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it’ argument can be tossed around here, and Apple certainly hasn’t had any trouble shifting large quantities of its smartphone in recent years; but in a year when Samsung and LG dramatically slashed the bezels to give us striking, futuristic designs, the iPhone 8 falls flat.It’s not like Apple has missed this trend – the bezeless iPhone X is testament to the fact that it hasn’t – but it means the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus look ever-more dated against the competition, which now includes a rival in their own camp.There’s still a camera bump too – this is easily remedied with a case, but for those wanting to show off the new glossy rear of the phone it increases the chance of damage when you place it on a flat surface.The power/lock key is still easy to hit on the right side of the handset, as is the centralized home button with Touch ID fingerprint scanner located in the bezel below the 4.7-inch display. The mute switch and volume keys reside on the left of the phone, and are again well placed for easy manipulation.It all works, the design is functional, and it’s not a bad-looking handset – but glance at that price tag and it’s hard not to feel a little short-changed on initial inspection.A final word on the glass rear too – we prefer the way it looks and feels versus the metal body of the iPhone 7 and co., but it also means it’s even more slippery. If you’re someone who’s liable to drop their smartphone, the iPhone 8 comes with a high risk warning, so invest in a bumper, as there’s glass to be smashed on both sides now. Apple says the glass is super-tough, but we’ve found that it does scratch – and if you opt for the Space Grey color it’s also quite the fingerprint magnet. The silver model we reviewed was more forgiving though, which meant less time cleaning it with our shirt sleeve. Apple also offers a striking gold color option and, now, the Product Red iPhone 8 if you held out for the special edition hue. Display  4.7-inch Retina HD display, same as the iPhone 7  Apple’s True Tone tech improves colors and contrast  On paper there’s nothing between the iPhone 8 display and the screen on the phone it’s replacing. Both it and the iPhone 7 boast a 4.7-inch IPS display with a 750 x 1334 resolution, giving a 326ppi pixel density.In fact, it’s the same size and resolution as the iPhone 6, which was launched back in 2014.While on paper this may seem like the same old story of Apple refusing to be pushed on upping specification, it hasn’t left the display alone completely, adding True Tone display technology to the panel.What this does is monitor the ambient light around the handset, and calibrate the screen to best suit the lighting conditions you’re in. It results in stronger colors and improved contrast, which does make the display look better than iPhone screens that came before it.Place True Tone and non-True Tone iPhones side by side and you can see some improvement, but the iPhone 8’s display still doesn’t have quite the same colorful punch, or clarity, as the QHD+ AMOLED display on the Galaxy S8.The color reproduction is improved as well, with Apple focusing on what actually makes the screen look good rather than pushing the pixels for the sake of the spec sheet... but a boost to Full HD would have made an actual difference to the quality and clarity.Games and videos look bright and vivid though, and the screen itself is responsive, giving a solid overall experience. It’s hard to knock the screen on its own merits, as it’s only when you put it alongside rivals that it lacks the same clarity.The fact that the screen is smaller than a lot of flagship rivals also means it’s easier to hold and use one-handed, and we were able to stretch our thumb comfortably to most areas of the screen, which isn’t as easy on the larger iPhone 8 Plus.I was working on this idea of blending app design with the #iPhoneX notch. 📲🤗 pic.twitter.com/lj2AhxWNeESeptember 18, 2017I was working on this idea of blending app design with the #iPhoneX notch. 📲🤗 pic.twitter.com/lj2AhxWNeESeptember 18, 2017",,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-8-review,John McCann
31,,2019-03-05T12:06:06Z,3Vdv5tdSAPUXTejA2DySQP,"The iPhone XR is a marketing masterstroke for Apple: not only has it delayed the launch of the third of its trio of 2018 iPhones, thus creating some mystery around it, it’s also managed to make this seem like 2018's ‘cheap’ iPhone.Yes, it’s cheaper compared to the recently-launched iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, but we’re talking $749 (£749 / AU$1229) compared with $999 (£999 / AU$1,629), which is hardly budget. To the average price-conscious, brand-neutral buyer this is a long way from a ‘cheap iPhone’. To the Apple fan who wants to stick with the brand though, the iPhone XR offers a much cheaper way to get a 2018 model without having to pay the sky-high prices of the XS duo, without sacrificing too much in terms of features – and with a cheeky amount more performance than one might expect.iPhone XR colors - which is right for you?While it’s impossible to know for certain what Apple is aiming to achieve with the later launch of the iPhone XR, the fact remains that it’s already enjoyed the buzz of the new iPhone XS launch, and now has a second bite of the, er, apple in terms of generating hyper around this ‘mystery’ phone. Well, Apple has either pulled a marketing masterstroke or screwed itself by missing sales from launching late – as the XR is one of the best iPhones we’ve ever tested.iPhone XR price and release dateThe price of the iPhone XR is something that’s going to attract buyers: at $749 / £749 / AU$1229 for the 64GB model ($799 / £799 / AU$1299 for 128GB and $899 / £899 / AU$1479 for the 256GB) it’s far more affordable than the iPhone XS.You can now buy the phone around the world as it was released on October 26 2018, and it's on sale in Apple Stores and at your local phone emporium, with few concerns about stock levels. The price has yet to change much, even though the iPhone XR is now around half a year old. Some contracts are cheaper than others, and the cheapest prices can be found on our best iPhone XR deals guide and our guide to the best US iPhone XR deals too.What's new?Compared to the iPhone XS, the iPhone XR is downgraded in a number of ways to hit that lower price point. That said, there are a number of key features that are the same: iOS 12 is the operating system that runs things, and it’s backed up by the wildly-powerful A12 Bionic chipset inside.The notch contains all the same front-facing cameras and sensors as the iPhone XS, and the dual speakers still face the same way when pumping out sound. iPhone XR specsWeight: 194gDimensions: 150.9 x 75.7 x 8.3mmOS: iOS 12Screen size: 6.1-inchResolution: 1792 x 828CPU: A12 BionicStorage: 64/128/256Rear camera: 12MPFront camera: 7MPColors: Blue, White, Black, Yellow, Coral, RedResistance: IP67To the untrained eye, or someone not holding the iPhone XR and XS side by side, it might even be hard to instantly tell the two apart – but there are a number of key differences that we need to dig into.Only a single cameraArguably the most impressive thing about the iPhone XS is the camera, as it’s the only thing that feels significantly upgraded over the iPhone X. While the iPhone XR offers the same ‘standard’ lens as the XS, it lacks the telephoto second sensor, so has to do some fancy tricks with software to compensate.This means you won’t be able to zoom in as far with the XR, as the telephoto lens offers (relatively) lossless photography at two times zoom, while portrait mode, where the background is blurred out, isn’t as effective.You can still take a portrait shot and have the background attractively blurred to keep the focus on the subject, but unlike with the iPhone XS, you can’t take pictures of objects and animals in the same way.This is due to the fact the software can’t identify those subjects as easily from the single sensor, where the additional hardware on the more expensive XS is able to draw on more info.The Liquid Retina screenApple is never one to shy away from some marketing hyperbole, and the iPhone XR comes with a ‘new’ type of LCD, a screen that’s been designed to allow it to make this curved, ‘all-screen’ display.The effect is much like the LCD screens Apple has made before, to be honest, as they’ve always been colorful and sharp, but with the new ‘Liquid Retina’ display things are supposed to closer to the high-end OLED screen.We’ll delve more into the quality of the screen later in this review, but it’s one of the key differences you’ll want to consider if you’re thinking about going for the less-costly iPhone.No 3D Touch on the iPhone XRThere’s one way to know if you use a feature on an iPhone, and that’s to take it away, and see if you miss it. Anyone coming from a later-series Apple handset will have had access to 3D Touch, where pressing the screen harder opens menus or activates different features in apps.This feature has been removed for the iPhone XR, presumably to save money – instead you have to do a ‘long press’ to do the same thing. So if you ever accessed shortcuts by pushing harder on an app, or opened the torch with a harder prod on the lock screen… well, that’s gone.We didn’t realise how much we used that feature before – and it’s irritating to not have something that feels like a real button to open the camera – but it doesn’t take long to get used to the alternative… it just feels a bit less premium.Chunkier designThe iPhone XR is also a thicker design, with chunkier bezels around the side of the phone – hold it side by side with an iPhone XS and you’ll feel it’s clearly the cheaper model, with a thicker feel in the hand.However, looking at it and handling it in isolation you’ll just feel that it’s a smooth, rounded design that apes the popular form of the iPhone 7 or iPhone 8 – basically, the iPhone XR is the all-screen version of those handsets, bringing a screen the size of those on the  iPhone 7 Plus or 8 Plus in a form factor that’s more akin to the smaller models.Multiple colorsImage 1 of 6Image 2 of 6Image 3 of 6Image 4 of 6Image 5 of 6Image 6 of 6iPhone XR colors - what shades does it come in?The iPhone XR is the first in a long time to come in so many colors: (product) RED, which is the sample we have, blue, white, yellow, coral and black - to some, this would feel like the natural successor to the iPhone 5C.It's a nice look, although it would be nice to have some more flashes of color on the front of the phone too. If you're thinking of buying an iPhone from a fashion point of view, this could well be the way to do it, with the colors chosen impressing when we checked them all out at the launch event.Improved batteryApple believes you’ll be able to get 90 minutes more battery life out of the iPhone XR than the 8 Plus, which is a big jump in real terms.Well – and we don’t want to spoil the surprise a little later – we’d say it’s even better: the iPhone XR finally achieves the holy grail of all-day battery life in an iPhone.Perhaps that’s giving Apple a little too much credit – after all, there are plenty of Android phones out there that can utterly smoke the iPhone range for power longevity, giving you far longer between charges.Apple has offered terrible battery life for years, incrementally improving it to be ‘just good enough’, and the iPhone XR is the first iPhone we haven’t had a real worry about day to day – and that alone could elevate it to the heights of being the greatest iPhone ever created.",,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xr-review,Gareth Beavis

It looks identical to last year's iPhone X, and you might think that not a lot has changed – but it’s inside where the differences lie.This is a weird situation for a review; usually, when looking at an ‘S’ variant of an iPhone we’re asking the question of whether it’s better than the now-cheaper model from the previous year.In 2018, however, Apple has made the choice to discontinue the iPhone X, so while we can draw comparisons they won’t help you make an informed choice (unless you can still pick one up while stocks last).Update: The iPhone XS has new competition in the form of the Samsung Galaxy S10 and Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus. We've added details of them to the competition section of this review.If you want the best iPhone Apple has created, the iPhone XS is surely it – but do the tweaks inside really justify the price tag, and are they enough to fend off the ever-improving competition?There’s also the iPhone XR – it’s a more affordable handset than the iPhone XS, but packs in many of the same features, making it in many ways more impressive.Read our in-depth iPhone XS Max reviewRead our in-depth iPhone XR reviewRead our in-depth Apple Watch 4 reviewiPhone XS price and release dateStarts at $999 / £999 / AU$1,629Top model costs $1,349 / £1,349 / AU$2,199In terms of the price, the good (ish) news is that it hasn't risen over last year’s incredibly expensive iPhone X, with the 64GB iPhone XS price coming in at $999 / £999 / AU$1,629. The 256GB iPhone XS price is $1,149 / £1,149 / AU$1,879, and the 512GB iPhone XS price is $1,349 / £1,349 / AU$2,199.That said, while the cost of rival smartphones has been going up, the iPhone XS is still going to be one of the most costly phones you can buy (apart from the iPhone XS Max, which carries the eye-watering price tag of $1,099 / £1,099 / AU$1,799 for the cheapest option).You may be able to find the phones a little cheaper from other stores though. In the UK, our guide will help you find the best iPhone XS deals on contract.Key featuresNew gold color optionSame design and similar features as last genUsually in this section we'd talk about all the new features that the phone brings – but in this case there really aren't that many, with Apple resolutely sticking to the strategy of launching an 'S' phone with little changed other than speed improvements and a few other performance bumps.That's not to say it isn't impressive, and useful, new hardware in the iPhone XS, but most of the benefits won't be instantly discernible to the average user.One change that is easy to spot is the new color: the gold variant is more mocha than anything else, with a touch of copper in the shade, and brings another option in addition to the Space Gray and silver options.We can only surmise that this was possible because the chassis of the iPhone XS is so similar to that of the iPhone X, so it wasn't expensive or time-consuming to alter the process to add in a new hue.A12 Bionic chipsetThe iPhone XS and XS Max both have the same chipset insideLoads of powerNeural Engine brings enhancements throughoutNotably more powerful AR capabilitiesApple is proudly talking up its new chipset, and with good reason: it's one of the most powerful on a smartphone, created as it was using a 7nm process. That may not mean much to most people, but essentially it means that more transistors can be chucked onto this hexa-core CPU, which has two 'power' cores and four more that are optimized for efficiency.However, even those slower cores are still more powerful than any of those found in the iPhone 6, a handset that's only four years old, showing just how rapidly smartphone technology is progressing in terms of power and efficiency.One might question whether this much power is really needed – and sure, if you're just browsing the web and sending messages it's utterly wasted. However, if you want to explore the world of augmented reality, then these extra transistors are on hand to help out.There's also a new 'Neural Engine' in the mix, enabling your phone to become more intelligent, learning as you use it. It adds a 'smart layer' to proceedings, allowing the handset to recognize things on the screen, whether that's appending an Animoji to your head in real time during a FaceTime call, or working out what's needed to improve the quality of a photo as you're taking it.It's hard to really quantify the benefit of this improved chipset other than through numbers. Running the iPhone XS through the Geekbench CPU testing process showed that it's the most powerful phones we've ever used: a score of 11,481 is over 1,000 higher than the iPhone X from last year, and better than any phone we've tested.That speed improvement is easy to feel within the phone, as the iPhone XS is one of the snappiest handsets we've ever tapped our way through. It's tricky to say how much of this is down to the hardware and how much to the improved iOS 12 software – but either way, it's a really, really rapid experience.The A12 chipset brings a step up in graphical performance too – gaming is getting ever closer to console-level graphics, and we had the chance to check out a few AR titles too.That said, we're still not fully convinced about the benefits of AR gaming – it's mildly diverting for a while, but many titles still seem to lack the overall polish that more typical iPhone games bring, such as Elder Scrolls: Blades, where you've got incredible gaming prowess mixed with high-level effects within.For instance, we played ElemenTao, and not only did it lack any kind of tutorial but it was a bit clunky when we tried to play it on a desk. That's not really the fault of the game, but rarely do we have a large table with nothing on it on which we can play solo titles, or with chums.Yes, there will be moments when it's cool, but they'll be as rare as deciding to play board games of an evening – so it depends if that’s what you’re into.",,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xs-review,Gareth Beavis
33,,2018-10-04T15:17:41Z,rk6YjvS37v9AK7u64ppvPV,"Update: The LG G7 is no longer the newest phone from the company after the release of the LG V40, but it still has decent specs and some retailers might have dropped its price accordingly. Here's our updated review.The LG G7 ThinQ touts a Super Bright LCD that's viewable in direct sunlight, which is ironic because the rest of it has a hard time standing out.It's a reasonable, but not significant upgrade over last year's LG G6, and with a larger 6.1-inch all-screen display, AI-enhanced cameras, a loud 'Boombox Speaker', a faster chipset, and Google's Android 8.0 Oreo software out of the box.It's also cheaper than the new LG V40, which has five cameras, slightly better specs and a larger 6.4-inch OLED screen. It's a monster phone with a monster pricetag.You may not immediately be wowed by any of the LG G7 specs in comparison. It doesn't have a curved OLED screen like the Samsung Galaxy S9, the triple-lens rear camera of the Huawei P20 Pro, or the undeniable value of the OnePlus 6. And despite its controversial notch cutout at the top, it doesn't have Apple's fancy 3D TrueDepth camera, as seen on the iPhone X.LG is emphasizing that this is a smart, not flashy, phone. As the 'ThinQ' part of the name suggests, the company is determined to push AI onto all of its smart devices no matter how awkward the moniker sounds. The execution on this new ThinQ phone is, thankfully, a little more practical than the nomenclature.Watch our hands-on LG G7 ThinQ video below to see the phone in actionThere's a dedicated AI button on the left side of the phone, and LG isn't forcing its own virtual assistant homebrew into your daily life like Samsung does with Bixby. No, this button leads to the familiar Google Assistant, and uses far-field voice recognition to better understand commands. In short, it's better than the Bixby button.Its dual-lens AI camera emphasizes ThinQ, too, with its ability to categorize subjects and automatically tune its settings to snap better photos via machine learning. It can also recognize low-light situations, and employ Super Bright Mode to make photos and video four times as bright as on the G6, albeit – at a reduced resolution.The LG ThinQ a more normal-looking, risk adverse phone from LG. It's pleasing, but not at all surprising.We tested LG G7 for several weeks, and noticed an uptick in photo quality next to the G6, just like we saw on the LG V30S ThinQ, the first LG phone with its AI camera and Bright Mode. It's not better than the Google Pixel 2, Google Pixel 2 XL, or Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus – most due to LG's smaller camera sensor size – but it's still a step up for LG, and this is one of the only phones with a wide-angle camera. The wide-angle rear camera was able to capture more of what we saw in front of us, and LG’s robust cinematic video tools make it easier to record 4K video with a lot of style. On the front of the G7, LG finally upgraded its front-facing camera to 8MP. That's where we see the biggest improvement among the cameras, if only because LG has been holding back with a 5MP on previous handsets.Google Lens appears with two taps of the new AI buttonMachine learning is just one way to aid in capturing superior photos, but like the megapixel count, what matters more are how the pictures look after everything is processed. We have a full gallery of photos later in the review.The LG G7 wins on completeness, even if it doesn't have many standout features. It doesn't take big chances on design or battery life, but it looks stylish in most colors and lasts long enough with all-day longevity. It's biggest weakness is the price, specifically in the US, next to its competitors that are do things a little bit better in almost every department. Depending on where you live, it's either a good deal for a phone without much pizzazz (like in the UK), or overpriced and will have you counting down the days to the inevitable LG V40 (like in the US). LG G7 is this year's smartphone sleeper hit no matter where you live.Price and release dateRelease date: May/June 2018US LG G7 price: $749UK LG G7 price: £599AU LG G7 price: AU$ $1,099The LG G7 ThinQ was announced on May 2, 2018 and its available in the UK, US, Australia and a number of other markets around the worldIn the US, the LG G7 is available from all carriers apart from AT&T, which instead has opted to exclusivly stock the LG V35 instead.We're still waiting for the official price and release date information.The LG G7 price is more expensive than we had hoped: $749 in the US through Verizon and T-Mobile, with the latter selling the Raspberry Rose color exclusively. Verizon, meanwhile, is slashing the price by $100 if you buy it on a device payment plan ($31.25 a month for 24 months) – essentially making it $650, and 100% more confusing. Let's go 110% more confusing and cite that Sprint will have it for even more: $792. Ouch.It's £599 SIM free in the UK, making it significantly cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy S9 launch price in the UK, even though the LG G7 is more expensive than the S9 in the US.It's AU$1,099 in Australia at stores JB Hi-Fi and Mobileciti, that's cheaper than the S9.Where you are in the world really determines whether or not the G7 is a good value.Super Bright LCD and glass design6.1-inch Super Bright LCD display makes it easier to see your phone screen outdoorsNotch design makes way for status icon-filled ‘New Second Screen’ Sleep/wake button moved to the side, fingerprint sensor remains on backGlass back, 3.5mm headphone and IP68 water-resistance The LG G7's design puts an emphasis on its 6.1-inch LCD screen, which takes up nearly the entire front of the device, save for a notch at the top and a small chin bezel at the bottom. Its clean-looking unibody glass and all-screen aesthetic are a big upgrade over the fractured metal LG G5 look two years ago, even if this means you have to forgo a replaceable battery.The notch left and right sides can be hidden in black or accentuated with various colors and gradients. Either way, it's extra screen space for status icons, the time and the battery life percentage.LG calls the top screen space to the left and right of the notch its ‘New Second Screen’ – it’s not. At least not like it was on the LG V10 and LG V20 second screen which showed detailed notifications. This is simply where the time, battery life percentage, and small notification icons live.The notch is also LG’s way of expanding the screen to a 19.5:9 aspect ratio – there’s a smidgen more space to fit all of those status icons. And, hey, if you don’t like the controversial notch look, you can always ‘hide' it by masking the screen corners. Or, if you really want to highlight this Apple-esque design trait, you can change up the color and even add gradients (the middle notch will always be black, though). You can see the blacked-out LCD sides surrounding the notch, but only with a discriminating eye in certain light. However, after several months of using the LG G7 we grew to accept the notch, and we now hardly notice it.The LCD also carriers an always-on display, despite the fact that this is more of an OLED-benefiting technology.Why LCD? LG likes to boast that its entire display can get very bright – maxing out at 1,000 nits. This makes it ideal for outdoor use when a normal smartphone peaks at 500 or maybe 600 nits. LG calls this its Super Bright Display, and says it's 30% more energy efficient in this mode versus the LG G6 screen.Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus (top) vs LG G7 ThinQ (bottom) in direct sunlight. The G7, in this test, looked brighter.The Super Bright Display mode lasts for three minutes, a cap meant to save your battery and not overheat the device. That was just enough time to read messages our phone screen while walking outdoors in direct sunlight in our preliminary testing. The problem is that the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus we were carrying also showed a peak brightness of more than 1,000 nits. It’s one of the few phones that can do this besides the G7, but it’s also LG’s chief smartphone rival. It some cases, the G7 looked brighter without distorting the images on-screen, but not always.The LG G7 ThinQ has an easy-to-reach fingerprint sensor on back, just below a vertically stacked dual-lens rear camera. Only this sensor pad doesn’t click in to double as a sleep/wake button, like on other recent LG devices. LG’s design team has returned the power to the right side of the phone – where it belongs – after much feedback. They've clearly gotten our letters.Remember when LG used to put both the sleep/wake button and volume buttons on the back of its phones, circa LG G4? Yes, it provided cleaner sides, and it was easier to grasp the device without accidentally pressing these buttons, but the design always felt too unconventional. The LG G7 feels like a mainstream, immediately familiar smartphone, and that’s pleasing.The sleep/wake button returns to the right side of the phone. The fingerprint sensor remains on the back, but doesn't click in.There is one extra button, too: the new dedicated AI button that sits on left side of the metal frame. More than a few times, we mispressed this Google Assistant shortcut, mistaking it for the volume down key on the left side. It’s the same problem we have with Samsung’s Bixby button. Luckily, you can turn off LG’s AI button, and the company is contemplating letting users remap it to another action in the future. LG could have avoided this issue though by adding a textured finish to the AI button, making it easier to recognize under thumb.LG’s AI button is better than Samsung’s, however. A single press launches Google Assistant, a double press launches you straight into Google Lens, and a long press on the key takes you straight into voice commands with Assistant. It’s a far more intuitive system than Samsung’s, and one we can see ourselves using.The LG G7 comes in a bunch of colors: Raspberry Rose, New Moroccan Blue, New Aurora Black, and New Platinum Gray. The LG G7 has a clean, albeit plainer look than the curved Samsung Galaxy S9 and Apple’s completely chin-less all-screen OLED. It feels premium in the hand, and at 162g is has a good weight without being too overbearing. Those with smaller palms will still likely find the LG G7 too big to use one-handed though.One thing to note though, the glass rear of the LG G7 is a real fingerprint magnet, so if you're not planning on putting a case on the phone be prepared to give it regular wipes.You can opt for a variety of colors to spice things up: Raspberry Rose, New Moroccan Blue, New Aurora Black, and New Platinum Gray. Not all LG G7 colors will be available in all countries. In the US, you'll find Raspberry Rose on T-Mobile. New Moroccan Blue is exclusive to the UK via O2.",LG G7 ThinQ review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lg-g7-thinq-review,Matt Swider
34,,2018-01-30T21:47:20.29Z,JXmXtb3pndwtYbaw8mg4SA,"The LG Q6 is the midrange take on the company’s 2017 flagship smartphone, the LG G6. As you can see for yourself, much of the G6’s visual pizazz has made the transition to the more budget-friendly class intact. It features the familiar tall aspect ratio, a nearly bezel-free design, and commendable build quality that yields a smooth feeling in the hand. However, given its lower asking price, not every single one of the G6’s finer qualities makes an appearance. The plastic back, for example, is prone to scratching. You won't find a fingerprint sensor here – a feature served up by the sub-$100 Moto E4. Predictably, the Q6’s internal specs are decidedly ho-hum and don’t pack adequate muscle to hustle through some of the more demanding 3D games available on the Google Play Store.(Update: The Q6 has been added to our list of best cheap phones that you can buy right now. Without a fingerprint sensor, it doesn't place very high on said list, but in many ways, it's still a stellar option.If you've waited to pick up the Q6, you've been rewarded with more color options. Blue, and violet have been added to the list, so black and platinum are no longer the sole color choices.)The budget smartphone arena is competitive as ever and the Q6's downsides are hard to forgive. But, as it's available for as low as $239 in the US with Amazon supported ads, you're still getting a whole lot of phone for the cash.Image 1 of 9Image 2 of 9Image 3 of 9Image 4 of 9Image 5 of 9Image 6 of 9Image 7 of 9Image 8 of 9Image 9 of 9LG Q6 price and availabilityAvailable now starting at $239 (£239, AU$399)Supports GSM networks only, including AT&T and T-MobileThe Q6 is now available globally. If you're outside of the US, you can snag this phone from your local retailer, but the story is a little more complicated in the US.LG's new midrange smartphone is available through Amazon's discounted, ad-supported program for a discounted rate. For $239, the Q6 will come stocked with lockscreen offers, ads and a fleet of Amazon apps pre-installed.If you'd rather have the device clear of any bloatware, it will set you back $299. Keep in mind that this device won't work with the likes of Verizon and Sprint, since its radio only supports GSM networks, including AT&T and T-Mobile.FullVision display and the camera save this phoneTaller aspect ratio makes for a more immersive viewing experience1080p display is crisp and vibrant, but at the cost of color accuracyCamera tech and software is among the most competent aroundThe Q6 calls out to the multimedia fans with its 5.5-inch FullVision display that pushes away bezels in favor for more screen real estate. Unlike most phones, this one has an 18:9 display that runs at 2,160 x 1,080 – and odd resolution thanks to the odd aspect ratio.All this means is that it’s literally twice as tall as it is wide. While this doesn’t impact general use all that much, the extra bit of screen gained makes watching movies and playing games a bit more immersive on the Q6, as it did on the G6.Speaking on the screen’s quality, its LCD is plenty detailed, vibrant and plenty bright, though sometimes to the point where the colors look washed out and the lighting can be harsh on the eyes. Moving to the cameras, LG’s 13MP single rear-facing sensor is shockingly capable in the right hands – and in favorable lighting conditions. LG’s camera app is fast to boot from the lock screen and though it doesn’t always produce great results, it’s one of the better midrange cameras out there.LG Q6 specsScreen size - 5.5 inchesResolution - 2,160 x 1,080Battery - 3,000mAHFront camera - 5MPRear camera - 13MPWeight - NADimensions (mm) - NAOS - Android NougatCPU - Snapdragon 435RAM - 3GB RAM (varies per region)Storage - 32GB w/ microSDWhile most of the heavy-lifting is performed by the larger sensor, the front-facing camera is no slouch. At 5MP, the detail presented in each photo isn’t astounding, but being able to swap between regular and wide-angle presentation is an awesome perk that LG loves to stick in its phones.Adding to this, LG’s camera software continues to be among the best, if not the best, around. From filters to the simple user interface and innovative dual capture that staples two squared-off images together, creators will have a blast here.Further down in the review, you can check out a growing collection of photo samples that show off the highs and lows of this phone’s capabilities. All said, the Q6 won’t replace your point-and-shoot or your flagship smartphone camera. But if your expectations are checked, this phone will impress.Battery lifeThe LG Q6 packs in a 3,000mAh battery, which for a phone of this size and price is a fairly modest capacity.Like most phones available now, the Q6 has no issue whatsoever surviving a day of use. However, if you’re a multimedia or Twitter hog like me, you’ll likely finish your day in the 20% area with the Q6. To give you a better idea on how the battery drains, watching a 90-minute high definition video wiped out 16%. This leaves a healthy amount of life left in the Q6 to stick by your side for the rest of the day. However, if you’re watching the on-and-off YouTube clip, interspersed with a few rounds of Hearthstone, you’ll see the percentage plummet – as you would with any device.From a zeroed-out state, a half-hour plugged into the charger revives LG’s midrange smartphone to about 25%. It takes a full hour for it to reach 73% and just under an hour and a half to full charge it.Astoundingly, this phone can lie dormant for days without losing much battery. We left it on over a long, three-day weekend and returned to it still with 87% of the charge remaining.CameraAs we stated above, the LG Q6 is a competent snapper. Intimate, well-lit shots tend to come out as you’d hope they would and selfies pop in both regular and wide-angle presentation.We had issues with this phone’s low light performance, as we did with its tendency to overblow the highlights in a given photo. This can make shooting on a sunny or overcast day difficult when usually those are the best days to take photos during.We had a mix of victories and defeats with the Q6. Given its midrange status, we’re delighted that we had more of the former than the latter. Check out the photo album and video sample below.Image 1 of 20I was honestly not expecting results this good.

Sure, there was a lot to look at, but it's not the best look if you're whipping your phone out to capture some time-sensitive footage. Plus, the SteadyRecord feature, which uses electronic image stabilization (EIS) actually results in a more shaky picture, not less.Anything else I should know?At first blush, the Q6 looks like the LG G6. And while we described a few ways in which they’re very different devices, there’s more to it.Given the slashed price, the Q6 lacks the 2K display found on the more expensive device. Additionally, LG opted for rather scratch-prone plastic on its back. One tumble saw this phone slide across a tiled floor, collecting a surprising amount of blemishes along the way. This phone also isn’t waterproof, nor does it offer niceties like wireless charging or military-grade build that protects its front screen from cracking. Calling these aspects out aren’t meant to be dings against the Q6, but it’s important to distinguish them given how similar the two phones look.Lastly, you might want to purchase this phone in your region based on this review. But given that the Q6’s release is staggered, you likely won’t be able to purchase this phone in your region just yet. It’s currently available in South Korea, but is said to be heading west in the coming weeks.Who's it for and should I buy it?The LG Q6 is for people who want a midrange phone that people will mistake for a flagship. From every angle, it closely resembles the company’s high-end LG G6. But make no mistake: this phone’s innards, which compete with the likes of the Moto G5, aren’t going to knock your socks off.Two features really stick out as valid reasons to buy the Q6: its taller aspect ratio screen and the cameras. LG’s user interface scales well with most apps and lends itself to being an awesome screen to watch movies on. Its cameras, while sometimes tough to capture a great moment with, are capable of some surprisingly high-quality results.If the features above play a large role in your daily life as a phone user, there’s a lot to enjoy with the Q6. However, if you’re stepping down from a flagship in hopes that you can get the same kicks with a cheaper device, this device will miss the target for you.Before you jump in and buy the LG Q6, be sure to visit our sister site Getprice to compare the best prices in Australia!",,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lg-q6,Cameron Faulkner
35,,2018-08-03T09:55:06Z,fsF55WGiovDZzh82A9sTsW,"The Nokia 6.1 is part of the second wave of the new Nokia smartphones, and it's time for the resurgent brand to prove that it can offer more than just a single-hit of nostalgia.The original Nokia 6 got a strong 4-star review with some caveats - notably the slow charging and average hardware. When the Nokia 6.1 was announced, there was a lot of excitement among Android purists about the updated design, upgraded chipset and addition of fast charging. The price has had a little bump too.Read more: Nokia 3.1 Plus reviewBefore we get into whether it’s worth the extra spend, it’s worth mentioning that there’s some confusion around the name of this phone. The company itself calls it ‘the new Nokia 6’ in some places, and ‘Nokia 6.1’ in others, including on the box.We’ll be using both in this review, but it’s useful to know because the Nokia 6 (2017) is still out there, and you’ll want to double check you’re buying the newer handset before you pull the trigger.Nokia 6.1 (2018) price and availabilityThe new Nokia 6.1 price is $269 (£229, RS 16,999 about AU$420), which is slightly more than the launch price of its predecessor ($229, £200, AU$399).It's available from retailers in the US, UK and India and will be coming to Australia in more regions soon.Design and displayClassy aluminum design with eye-catching accent colorsGenerous 1080p screen with glossy finishWeighty and not the most comfortable to holdIn true Nokia style, the Nokia 6.1 is built like a tank. The 148.8 x 75.8 x 8.6mm (including camera bump) unibody is made from 6000-series aluminum with flat diamond-cut sides, rounded corners and a highlight color on the outlines.Our review model is the Black/Copper colorway, which is an innovative way to make yet another black rectangle look different - and classier - than its competition.There’s also a gorgeous deep blue option with gold accents, and White/Iron, which is a pale silver with metallic reddish accents rather than the deep grey you might expect from the name - presumably we’re talking about oxidized iron, aka rust.Between the all-metal body and the thickness of the handset, this is a weighty piece of tech at 172g and feels reassuringly like it could handle modern life without being cosseted in a case.That said, after a couple of weeks of use and several drops, we have noticed a few small dings in the edges, so you might want to case it up anyway if you’re a perfectionist about that kind of thing.Speaking of drops, the Gorilla Glass 3-covered screen is also built to last, sustaining no damage from our butter-finger tendencies (note: not a guarantee).However, with its incredibly glossy, slightly rounded design, it does make the phone liable to fall straight off your desk if you put it face-down. Face-up it’s fine and has plenty of grip, but if you’re one of those people who flips your phone over for meetings, it might be better off in a pocket.It’ll have to be a big pocket, though: the 5.5-inch screen and relative thickness at 8.6mm means this isn’t one of the sleeker phones on the market.That means it’s not the comfiest to hold in your hand, either: smaller-pawed humans might well find it uncomfortable for long stretches, and it’s ridiculously easy to entirely muffle the solo downward-firing speaker on the bottom left with the heel of your hand.Assuming you’re on board with the chunky aesthetic, the Nokia 6.1 is an impressively good-looking piece of kit considering its price point.The anodized back panel includes a long Zeiss-branded camera and flash opening, which protrudes a little. Below that is the fingerprint scanner, also ringed in the accent color, and past that is the sideways silver Nokia logo. That’s it for the back except for the Android One logo.The face of the phone is similarly minimalist, relying on that super-glossy screen and the accent color to stand out, which it absolutely does.There’s a small Nokia logo on the top right of the fairly large (for 2018) bezel, and there’s a thick black chin below the screen. This serves no obvious purpose as the fingerprint key is on the back and the nav buttons are software, but we can’t ask too much at the budget end of the market.The left edge holds the SIM tray, there’s a proper headphone jack on the top right of the top edge, accented volume rocker and power key on the right edge, and a centered USB-C charging port on the bottom next to that left-mounted speaker.Our only complaint about this layout is that it’s quite easy to miss the fingerprint pad by touch and smudge up the flash unit just above it. That said, at least you’re not putting your fingerprints all over the camera lens as with some phones.You will, however, get your fingerprints all over the glossy screen and the aluminum back panel.The 5.5-inch 16:9 screen of the Nokia 6.1 in particular is very smudgy, but it’s much less noticeable when the display is powered on.It’s a lovely-looking screen, bright and sharp, and while of course it can’t compare to the pixel-packed displays of the top-end devices, it does offer a full HD (1080 x 1920, 403ppi) experience in a much less expensive package. As long as you don’t hold it next to a Samsung Galaxy S9, you should be happy.",Nokia 6.1 (2018) review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nokia-6-2018-review,Holly Brockwell
36,,2018-11-04T06:11:03Z,cCpuv2g6rYabbamTSqbRgg,"UPDATE: Nokia 7.1 now runs the latest Android 9 Pie operating system. The following review has been updated to reflect this development.Since being rebooted under the watchful eye of HMD Global, the Nokia brand has been attached to some very solid, value-for-money handsets – think decent specs at a decent price, and a clean, stock version of Android to boot.With the Nokia 7.1, this rather appealing mid-range excellence is being pushed even further. But just how good can a phone at a mid-range price be? Actually rather good, the Nokia 7.1 whispers, with its attractive design, competent specs, and impressive camera.Not everyone wants to shell out four figures (or close to it) for a smartphone, of course, and these days you can get some rather capable phones for some rather appealing prices, with the Nokia 7.1 being one such handset.As for where this slots in to Nokia's increasingly complicated range, it's newer but cheaper than the Nokia 7 Plus. This is effectively Nokia's new champion mid-ranger, with only the Nokia 7 Plus and the Nokia 8 models (such as the Nokia 8 Sirocco) above it in terms of power and prestige.Nokia 7.1 price and release dateYours for a mere £299, US$349, AED 949On sale from November 2018You can buy the Nokia 7.1 unlocked for £299 in the UK, $349 in the US, AU$499 in Australia and AED 949 in the UAE, with shipping getting underway in early November.Even for a phone that's unashamedly mid-range, that's a low price – it's veering not far from budget territory. When you think that Apple's newest iPhone XS phones start the bidding at £999/$999, you're talking about a big price gap between the very top-end flagships of 2018 and what we have here with the Nokia 7.1.Your choice of colors depends on your market – midnight blue (like our review model) is available everywhere, with some regions (including the US, Australia and Middle East) stocking a gray silver option as well.Mid-range qualityYou get a lot for your moneyMiddling specs but superb packageWhat you really need to know about this phone is that it punches above its weight – it's weight being that price tag, the so-so Snapdragon 636 chipset inside, and the just-enough 3GB or 4GB of RAM. You get 32GB or 64GB of internal storage, though you can expand that with a memory card. These options vary by region.Where it goes beyond what you would expect from a mid-range phone is in the quality of its build, the quality of the display, and the quality of the camera. We're going to discuss all of these features in more detail in the review that follows, but they're the areas that the Nokia 7.1 stands out in.The HDR10 support on the display is worth noting, as it means superior contrast and a broader range of colors on the apps that support it (which include Netflix and Amazon Prime Video).On the camera side, a dual-lens rear camera is matched with a single-lens front-facing one, and the brand continues its #bothie push – that is, taking snaps that include shots from both the front and rear camera simultaneously. It's yet to turn into a craze, but if it does become popular, the Nokia 7.1 has you covered.Speaking of reasons why you'll maybe want to pick this phone up, it's also important to note that this is an Android One phone – that means stock Android, free from pointless tweaks and unwanted bloatware, and with a guarantee of speedy updates in the future.You get two years of Android updates and three years of security patches guaranteed with an Android One phone.While our unit was running Android 8 Oreo at the time of this review, the Android 9 Pie update is now available for the device, as indeed it should be on an Android One handset.The Nokia 7.1 probably won't win any design awards or any benchmark tests, but maybe your next smartphone doesn't have to. What we do get here is a winning combination of price, power, specs and features – this is what a mid-range phone should be.Not everything is perfect about the Nokia 7.1 though. The battery life disappoints, and the specs that we mentioned earlier mean the handset doesn't exactly race through tasks like switching between apps or running the latest games. There's no waterproofing here, and no wireless charging, to help keep costs down.Most phones are made up of some compromises though, and the Nokia 7.1 gets most of them right.Design and displayTall, bright, responsive displayQuality if unimaginative designThe Nokia 7.1 doesn't ooze the premium quality of something like the iPhone XS, but we're a fan of the design nonetheless. It takes the now-standard glass sandwich approach, with aluminum edges around the sides, and a 5.84-inch, 19:9 aspect ratio display – the 1,080 x 2,280 resolution gives you a very respectable 432 pixels-per-inch.There's a notch here, which is relatively chunky, and a bottom chin that's rather thick and makes this very obviously a mid-range handset.It didn't offend our eyes too much though – overall it's a good-looking phone front and back, though we wish phone makers would prioritize rear cameras without a bump again. It scores points for its nicely chamfered edges, without an angled corner in sight.Take a look at the slightly more expensive Nokia 7 Plus and the Nokia 7.1 obviously loses, without the extra metal accents and the soft matte backing, but every part of this phone is about the balance between price and quality – and it's a balance that the Nokia 7.1 gets right much more often than not.We found the LCD display bright, sharp and perfectly good for watching movies or checking through emails (that 19:9 aspect ratio really gives you a lot of scrolling room). Colors are vibrant and clean, and you could be fooled into thinking this is a display from a much more expensive phone.In use the screen is punchy and appealing, though this being an LCD display, it can be difficult to view in bright sunlight (that's an issue other LCD screens struggle with too, of course). Overall, from web pages to photos, it really impresses, even more than the appearance of the phone as a whole.As far as the rest of the design goes, we're less sure about the volume buttons above the power button (a Nokia staple), or about them being so high on the right-hand side – it makes it hard to adjust the volume in portrait mode.We did find ourselves getting more used to the layout as the week went on, so no doubt it's something it's possible to get adjusted to eventually.You don't get anything fancy like an in-screen fingerprint scanner – the fingerprint scanner is around the back, as usual. With a thickness of 8mm it's also slightly chunkier than some of the best phones around, though you're not really going to notice the difference.",,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nokia-71-review,David Nield

However, there’s still no clear release date for those in the US or Australia.HMD Global has brought most of its Nokia phones to Australia in the past, so fingers crossed this will also be one to land there. We haven’t seen many Nokia phones in the US for a while, but the company has just announced it will be partnering with US networks Verizon and Cricket Wireless to bring its phones to the market.Exactly when that will be remains unclear, but that may mean you’re able to buy the Nokia 8.1 in the US in the coming months. In the UK, the price is set at £379.99 (roughly $485 / AU$665), which considering it’s a mid-range device is a good price compared to a lot of the competition.Design and displayGlass on the front and back, aluminium around the sidesA large 6.18-inch Full HD+ displayFeatures a 3.5mm headphone jack, not waterproofThe Nokia 8.1 is essentially a larger Nokia 7.1 when you hold it in your hand. A lot of the design elements are similar, this is just a larger version of that handset, but it’s still not impossible to hold. With dimensions of 154.8 x 75.8 x 8mm it’s easy enough for most people to hold, and it isn’t too heavy at 180g.A lot of the design elements we’ve come to like from newer HMD Global-made Nokia handsets are here, and overall the design is attractive if not premium.Image 1 of 2Image 2 of 2The front and rear of the phone is made of glass, and there’s an aluminum frame holding the whole thing together. Our grip wasn’t fantastic on the phone at first because of that glass back, but it’s something we got used to after a few days of using it.The corners of the rear of the phone are rounded meaning it sits in the palm of your hand comfortably. The rear of the phone houses a fingerprint scanner that we found to work quickly and be in an easily reachable position.The camera sits above the scanner. It’s raised out from the back of the phone quite a long way. In fact, it protrudes out another 1.5mm over the phone, meaning the handset won’t sit down flat on a desk next to you. It’s not out far enough that it becomes uncomfortable in a pocket, though.The bottom edge of the Nokia 8.1 features a USB-C port as well as the single speaker, which is remarkably easy to cover up. You may find that an annoyance when watching video. The side edges of the phone are clear apart from a volume rocker, power button and the SIM tray.Image 1 of 3Image 2 of 3Image 3 of 3Then the top edge of the phone features a 3.5mm headphone jack, which anyone who likes wired headsets is sure to appreciate sticking around for this latest generation of Nokia handsets.The bezels around the display are thin, especially for a mid-ranger. There’s a notch at the top of the display to hide away the selfie camera and other tech, but we couldn’t get it to look like a normal notch.Instead, the two sides of the notch are covered in black and house the information you’d expect such as the time, notifications and battery level. So in other words the notch is semi-hidden. To be able to properly display the notch you’ll need to have developer software running on the phone, which is something we weren’t able to do.The 8.1 in the name of this phone doesn’t refer to the size of the screen, luckily. Instead the Nokia 8.1 features a 6.18-inch display with a Full HD+ resolution. That’s 2280 x 1080, with a pixel density of 408ppi.We found the display is good enough for the size of the phone. Picture quality isn’t incredible as it isn’t a QHD panel, and the technology used here is an IPS LCD rather than AMOLED. That said, for the price of this phone you’re unlikely to be disappointed with how the Nokia 8.1 looks. It’s around an 81% screen to body ratio though, so you’re not going to be getting an all-screen front on this handset..One final thing to note is that this isn’t waterproof. You won’t be able to get your Nokia 8.1 particularly wet, and we don’t currently know its exact IP rating so it may not even do well in the rain.

40,,2018-04-11T12:30:00.1Z,YgcS5hbWXw9wYErb7sZokS,"According to IDC, in 2018, the top five smartphone brands in India were Xiaomi, Samsung, Vivo, Lenovo and Oppo. That’s four Chinese companies with one South Korean conglomerate thrown in for good measure. Oppo’s claim to fame has been positioning itself as a 'selfie expert'. You know, for those annoying people you see at malls everywhere in Delhi. In all seriousness though, cashing in on how important the ‘perfect selfie’ has become doesn’t seem like the worst idea.The F series isn’t Oppo’s line of flagship devices, that would be the R15 but the company seems to have no plans of launching it in India. That being said, the Oppo F7 borrows heavily from the R15. Both the devices run on the MediaTek Helio P60 SoC and feature the iPhone-X type notch.The selfie specialist is priced to go head-to-head with the Vivo V9. Not only does it undercut the Vivo’s phone by Rs. 1,000 but the camera also compares better. The Oppo F7 may not be the best phone in the mid-range segment, but it’s worth a look to see if the phone at least does what the company promises.Price and availabilityThe 4GB RAM and 6GB storage variant, which is the one we tested, costs Rs 21,990. Oppo has another offering with 6GB RAM and 128GB storage, which is priced Rs 26,990. The phone hit the market on April 9, though the first flash sale happened on April 2. You can buy it online via Flipkart, Amazon or Paytm. If you prefer demoing the device before buying it, it’s also available offline through 777 Oppo stores.Oppo F7 Specifications Dimensions:   156 x 75.3 x 7.8 mm OS: Android 8.1 (Oreo) Screen size: 6.23 inches  Resolution: 1080 x 2280 pixels CPU: MediaTek Helio P60RAM: 4GB / 6GBStorage: 64GB / 128GB Battery: 3,400mAh  Rear camera: 16MP Front camera: 25MP  Jio and ICICI have special offers for cashback and data if you buy the Oppo F7 but what’s more interesting is that Oppo is offering a one-year deal on replacing the screen of the new smartphone. The device we’ve reviewed is Solar Red, but the phone is also available in Diamond Black and Platinum Silver.Design and displayOppo F7 displayThe Oppo F7 doesn’t look too premium or extremely cheap, it falls somewhere in between which is perfectly fine since it’s a mid-range phone. It hits the sweet spot with respect to weight. It’s not heavy enough to weigh you down but not so light that it doesn’t feel durable.Where the phone falters is that it chose to use plastic with a glossy layer to make it shine like glass. I understand the appeal since most of the flagship phones have a glass back, but it attracts fingerprints like bees to honey. You can polish the phone all you want but it’s only going to be truly clean if it isn’t touched.While reviewing the phone, I’m pretty sure I spent more time cleaning it than actually using it. The device doesn’t scratch too easily despite being thrown in with keys and what not, but it’s not impervious to external forces. Apparently keys aren’t tough enough but crumbs on the table scratch the screen if you pull it off the table rather than pick it up. This applies to the screen as well as the back of the phone. As far as I’m concerned, they’re both equally vulnerable. The primary camera and the fingerprint sensor are located around the back with a MicroUSB port and a 3.5mm headphone jack at the bottom. Though the lack of a Type-C port is a little disappointing, retaining the headphone socket is a win in my books.Power button, sim slotThe new Oppo smartphone is also one of the many devices to employ the iPhone X-type notch. The F7 also manages to use it in a way that maximises utility, unlike the Vivo V9. With a 19:9 aspect ratio, the Oppo F7 lets compatible apps run in fullscreen and gives you the option of forcing apps to fullscreen if they’re not compatible.With a 6.23-inch screen the phone is far from being compact or ergonomic but that is offset by the immersion when playing games or watching videos. ",,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/oppo-f7,Prabhjote Gill
41,,2016-09-20T07:00:00.263Z,nTcke2dDUu943vGSP4uiFg,"HTC's duo of new mid-range smartphones aim to bring some flagship style to the middle of the market, and it's the HTC Desire 10 Pro leading the way as the most powerful Desire handset ever, borrowing several features from the HTC 10.While its cheaper brother, the Desire 10 Lifestyle, is firmly focused on audio, the Desire 10 Pro is a more well-rounded device, with a punchy octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor, 3GB/4GB of RAM, 32GB/64GB of internal storage, a microSD slot, a fingerprint sensor and the same 20MP rear camera as HTC's 2015 flagship, the HTC One M9.Those are solid foundations on which to build, and with an appealing design too the Desire 10 Pro could well make waves – but that depends to a large degree on the price, which is currently unknown.Release date and priceThe HTC Desire 10 Pro will be available to order from November – which means you've got some time to work out if it's a phone you may want – but we've been told it won't be coming to the UK.As for how much the Desire 10 Pro will set you back, we're still waiting to hear final confirmation from HTC, and this will dictate the potential success of the handset.What we do know is that the Pro will be more expensive than the Desire 10 Lifestyle – which may mean the Pro could be costlier than we'd like, as the Lifestyle is also marketed in the mid-range.If the Taiwanese firm can keep the price down to the levels of the OnePlus 3 then the Desire 10 Pro will be an attractive, disruptive presence in the market – but any higher and it could struggle against a number of cheaper, but just as feature-packed, rivals.Design and displayThe HTC Desire 10 Pro hasn't inherited the premium metal unibody design of the HTC 10, and we feel like we need to get that out of the way ASAP – but not because it's necessarily a bad thing, as the Desire 10 Pro is still a good-looking phone.At the heart of the 10 Pro is a metal frame, ensuring that it feels sturdy in the hand, but the main body material is soft-touch polycarbonate, which delivers a pleasing level of grip and comfort.Measuring 156.5 x 76 x 7.86mm, the Desire 10 Pro isn't as tall or as wide as some handsets sporting a 5.5-inch display, but it's still a noticeable presence in the palm, and requires two-handed operation for some tasks. It's not overly heavy though, tipping the scales at 165g.The phone is available in four colors: Stone Black, Royal Blue (dark blue), Valentine Lux (light blue) and Polar White, with all four options sporting gold trim for a more premium finish – although on the lighter hues this looks a little excessive.On the back, below the sizable camera sensor, you'll find a fingerprint scanner that provides a secure, easy way to unlock your handset – although we don't like the fact that it can't be reached when the device is lying screen-side-up on our desk.Still, this is the first time HTC has put a digit reader on a Desire phone, so the fact that it's there at all is a good thing.And for all those audio fans out there still reeling from the news that Apple has removed the headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, the good news is that HTC has kept it for the Desire 10 Pro.The company has even applied its BoomSound enhancement technology to the jack, giving you better audio when listening via headphones, although you won't get those enhancements when using the internal speakers – for that you'll need the Pro's sibling, the HTC Desire 10 Lifestyle.The HTC Desire 10 Pro features a 5.5-inch 1080p display, which is bright and clear – ensuring videos and games look great. Colors aren't quite as vibrant as we've seen on Samsung's Super AMOLED panels, but you're unlikely to have any issues day-to-day.What's it like to use?HTC has packed plenty of power into the Desire 10 Pro, with an octa-core chip at its heart capably supported by either 3GB or 4GB of RAM, depending on whether you opt for the 32GB or 64GB model.It's unlikely that you'll see both models available in your market, but don't be downhearted if you 'only' get the 3GB/32GB variant, as it will still pack a punch. There's a microSD slot too, allowing you to build on the internal space with cards up to 2TB in size.Even the lower-spec version of the Desire 10 Pro should be able to handle the latest games and applications from the Play Store, while Google's Android Marshmallow operating system runs smoothly.The Desire 10 Pro features the same Sense interface overlay as the HTC 10, allowing you to customize your home screens with various themes and stickers for a truly personal touch.CameraThe Desire 10 Pro has the best camera HTC has ever put on a Desire handset – to be precise, it's got the same camera as the HTC One M9.That means you're looking at a 20MP snapper with an f/2.2 aperture, HDR and two-tone flash. In one respect the 10 Pro even betters the M9's camera, as it adds laser autofocus. This should translate into bright, clear and in-focus shots, and strong performance in low light – although the camera is unlikely to match the snapper on the HTC 10.During our brief hands-on time with the Desire 10 Pro the camera was quick, and results serviceable – although the device we were using wasn't running final software, so we can expect some fine-tuning between now and when the phone launches in October.HTC has also redesigned its Pro Mode on the camera – an upgrade not even the HTC 10 has at the moment – with a trio of default settings including Macro and Sports, helping you tweak the various settings in an easier to understand way.This is great for those still trying to get their heads around white balance, shutter speed and exposure values.Around the front there's a 13MP camera, which boasts an HDR mode and a selfie panorama mode, allowing you to get even more buddies into your shots – that's a far higher megapixel count than the front snapper on the 5MP HTC 10.BatteryThe HTC Desire 10 Pro comes with a 3000mAh non-removable battery, which HTC claims will give you up to eight hours of internet use over Wi-Fi, 11 hours of HD video playback, or up to 53 hours of audio playback.We fully expect the Desire 10 Pro to last a full day in general usage then, and there's fast charging for when it runs low – but you'll have to wait for our in-depth review to find out for sure if the battery can go the distance.VerdictHTC's Desire range has been a little wayward in the past couple of years, but with the Desire 10 Pro the firm looks to have a promising mid-range phone on its hands.There's loads of great tech packed into the surprisingly premium polycarbonate body, and as long as HTC can keep the price of the Desire 10 Pro reasonable it's a phone we're really excited about fully reviewing.",,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/htc-desire-10-pro-1328870/review,John McCann

By iPhone standards it can be considered a budget option - and that may suit you, especially as it's still a solid handset, as this review shows - but if you're more after the latest and greatest iPhone you might want to consider the iPhone XS or iPhone XS Max.Or split the difference and pick up the iPhone XR - a new handset but one which is lower end than the XS range (though still packing newer tech and features than the iPhone 6S.If you do go for the iPhone 6S then you're looking at prices of around $370 / £300 / AU$630 for a 32GB model, which at the time of writing seems to be the most widely available model if you're hoping to buy new rather than refurbished. There are also 16GB, 64GB and 128GB versions though.Those prices mean the iPhone 6S sits in the lower mid-range now, but it's still quite pricey for a handset that came out in 2015, so if you're not set on Apple you might also want to consider some Android alternatives, such as the Honor 10, which offers a lot more power for not vastly more money.Of course, you miss out on iOS and Apple's App Store, among other things.

There are some very subtle differences, such as a slightly thicker frame and a little more heft, but it's so slight that I kept getting the two mixed up when doing side by side comparisons.All cases fit both phones just fine too so, apart from a small S logo on the back of the phone, nobody is going to notice you've got the latest iPhone.But there will be lots of you upgrading from the iPhone 5S, and in that case you'll need to be ready for a really big design change. The metallic chassis feels really nice in the hand, with a ceramic-like feeling on the outside (although if it's anything like the 6 then this can scuff over time if you keep it in a pocket with keys, so you'll need to think about the kind of case you'll want to keep it safe).If you're not ready to take the leap to the new, bigger form factor, Apple has the new iPhone SE to satisfy your 4-inch cravings.One of the things that Apple is touting is the fact the iPhone 6S is made of 7000 series aluminum, which is the strongest thing it's ever used in iPhone construction. The obvious connection people will make is with 'Bendgate', when some users claimed their new phone had developed a slight curve in their pocket without much pressure.The common belief was that these phones began to twist when placed in a rear pocket and sat upon. While it was proven that other metal phones actually were worse when it came to bending Apple didn't come out of the controversy well.So it's no surprise that, while the company won't admit the real reason, the new iPhone is strong and never going to bend with such pressure. However, I feel like that we shouldn't feel happy our phones no longer bend – this seems like one of the minimum expectations I'd have of a smartphone, not a compelling reason to buy it.The front of the phone is now covered in a new level of strength, with a glass that's far less prone to shattering when dropped on the floor – now that's something I can get behind. We've not drop tested it - we'll leave that to some other, braver reviewer - if the screen is stronger the responsiveness hasn't dropped.In the hand, the iPhone 6S still feels like a dream. Even with the extra 14g over the iPhone it feels lightweight, easy to manipulate and really warrants the price. Samsung's similarly old Galaxy S7 Edge invokes the same kind of feeling, and with it you don't mind spending the extra money over a more budget phone.In terms of design, if you've seen the iPhone 6 then you've seen the 6S. The volume buttons, the power key, the silencer switch and the speaker are all in the same place as its predecessor, with the grille at the bottom very easy to cover when you're watching videos or playing games in landscape.If you're using the 5S, this is leagues ahead. The construction is good, the materials solid and there's no wiggle in the buttons at all. While you probably never bent your 5S, the idea that the iPhone 6S is stronger will probably please you, however unnecessary the claim is.Apple's not done anything great with the design of the iPhone 6S, but the iPhone 6 was such a well-created phone that using the same chassis isn't going to harm its chances of success.However, combined with the higher price and the continued presence of the iPhone 6, I wish we were at least seeing some retooling of the phone to make it seem more attractive.ScreenThe screen on the iPhone 6S seems to be identical to the iPhone 6's: we're talking a 4.7-inch affair with 750p resolution, which keeps it firmly in the 'Retina' range that the firm debuted all the way back with the iPhone 4.It's hard to rate the display, as while it fails on resolution (quite spectacularly actually - phones a seventh the cost of the iPhone 6S offer 1080p screens, Samsung's cheaper phone has four times the resolution of the 6S and Sony has, inexplicably, launched a 4K phone) it doesn't drop too badly on performance.The iPhone 6S display is clear, bright, laminated to the glass and insanely colorful. The first time I saw it on the iPhone 6 I thought it was a fake picture stuck on top of a dummy unit, such was the clarity on offer.So to use the same thing on the iPhone 6S makes sense - after all, the lower pixel count means it can be thinner and the battery can last longer, thanks to having fewer pixels to drive.But there are some things missing: for instance, the contrast ratio (the difference between the brightest and darkest parts of the screen) is still poor, with the black areas looking a little grey. Samsung's Galaxy range predominantly uses OLED technology, which offers 'true' blacks and high brightness and packs a much better visual punch, and would have suited the iPhone down to the ground.The sharpness in side by side tests is clearly lower too - the 326 pixels per inch is very low even compared the 401ppi of the iPhone 6S Plus - and most other models are over 500ppi to bring really, really clear displays.Given OLED technology is used in the Apple Watch - and admittedly it looks brilliant - it's a shame the same thing couldn't have been done with the iPhone 6S.It's important not to get too hung up on screen resolution in a phone - after all, if it's not serving a purpose (hey, Sony?) then it's just wasting battery.

45,,2019-04-02T10:54:24Z,P8g9DY9BTfZHWmoicaHuMT,"Update: we've updated this review to account for newer iPhone models, including the iPhone XR, which make buying the iPhone 7 a tougher choice than it once was.The iPhone 7 is now the oldest iPhone (along with the iPhone 7 Plus) still sold by the company, and unsurprisingly it's also now the cheapest iPhone on offer through the firm's official website and stores.No longer is the iPhone 7 considered a flagship smartphone in Apple's stable, or even just one tier down, instead it's now the entry level option, which is great news for those in the market for a cheap iPhone.While it may have been replaced by two separate generations of iPhones, with a lower price tag and the latest iOS 12 software on board the iPhone 7 is still very much a viable option for those looking for a slice of Apple's smartphone pie.When the iPhone 7 arrived it wasn't all that different to the iPhone 6S, feeling more like another incremental 'S' variant update rather than a whole new device.The iPhone 7 did offer up a brighter, more colorful screen, a waterproof design, dual speakers, and a boosted 12MP camera over the 6S it replaced, and Apple changed the home button from a clickable entity to one that responds to pressure, lost the headphone jack and included a 256GB storage model (though now only offers it with up to 128GB).Some of that felt pretty alien back in 2016, but the iPhone 7 paved the way for the far different iPhone X the following year and then the arrival of the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR.Here's our take on the iPhone 7 in a video review:iPhone 7 price and availabilityiPhone 7 price (32GB): $449 (£449, AU$749)iPhone 7 price (128GB): $549 (£549, AU$919)Launch price: from $649 (£599, AU$1,079)iPhone 7 release date: September 2016The iPhone 7 price now starts at just $449 (£449, AU$749) for the 32GB model after it received another price drop thanks to the arrival of the iPhone XS, XS Max and XR.If you want more space, the 128GB iPhone 7 price is now $549 (£549, AU$919). Apple did sell a 256GB iPhone 7 model that it now no longer produces, so you're unlikely to find a new handset at this maximum capacity.As Apple has now discontinued the iPhone SE and iPhone 6S, it makes the iPhone 7 the cheapest iPhone available directly from the firm.The iPhone 7 is still widely available, from Apple itself and a host of retailers and carriers. With two significant price drops since launch, there are also great contract iPhone 7 deals to be had from carriers too.DesignWater resistance brings confidence in robustness of deviceSame design as previous two yearsHeadphone jack removal is inconvenientThe two bigger design changes on the iPhone 7 are big talking points: it can now survive plunges into a swimming pool, thanks to the water-resistant chassis, and the headphone jack on the bottom of the phone is no longer there.The iPhone 7 (black, below) loses the headphone jack and adds in an aesthetic grille insteadLet's start with the biggest of those changes: the omission of the headphone jack. It's a bold move from Apple – although calling it 'courageous' during the launch event was a bit much, and has led to some warranted memes – and one that could shake up the headphone industry.The loss of this port will impact users in varying degrees: for some people it'll be no more than a shrug before they get on with their day, because they only use the EarPods in the iPhone box – and those are still there, just with a Lightning connector.For others, though, it'll be an inconvenience, as they'll need to attach the short white dongle to the 3.5mm jack on the end of their headphones in order to plug them into the Lightning port.In a survey conducted over three commutes, we noticed that out of 60 people wearing headphones, 34 were using the bundled EarPods that Apple offers – given than many of those people might not have been using an iPhone, that's a higher number than expected.Losing the headphone jack also severely limits those wanting to buy a new pair of headphones for use with their iPhone, given how much we all listen to tunes or watch films on our phones these days.Sure, you can buy regular 3.5mm headphones, but then you'll have to connect the adaptor. If you want to get something directly compatible you'll either need to go Bluetooth or Lightning-ready – and there are fewer decent models available to buy in that latter category.AirPodsA quick Public Service Announcement: you DO NOT need to buy Apple's AirPods to get audio on the iPhone 7.Three separate people have told us that that's what they thought was the case when Apple launched them – that's something the brand needs to clarify soon.They're incredibly expensive at $159 / £159 / AU$229, and all they really do is cut the wire from the EarPods you get in the box.The sound quality doesn't feel like it's much better, and while the ability to tap one pod to activate Siri, or remove a Pod and have the sound instantly stop, is cool, it's not really worth the cash.Plus, there's also the fact that they don't look the most elegant in the ears – and if you struggle with the fit of the EarPods, these things are going to fall out all the time.They do have a lot of charge, come with a cool magnetic carry case (which also adds 24 hours of charge, to the point where we've not even come close to running ours down during the review) and free you from the wires… but these feel more like reference designs for future wireless Apple devices than the must-have iPhone accessory.Read our full Apple AirPods reviewYou can buy the iPhone 7 in a variety of colors, but the much loved Space Grey color has been dropped for this release. You're limited to gold, rose gold, silver, black, jet black or red - and of those only the black, silver, gold and rose gold options are still officially sold by Apple.The red iPhone is the newest addition to the color range and it's made in partnership with an AIDS charity called (RED). We've used a red iPhone 7 Plus for over a week since it was announced and found it garnered quite a lot of excitement when people spot the color.That excitement will have died down a little now though, especially as other iPhone models have also been made available in that color.This is the iPhone 7 Plus in red, but there's also a red iPhone 7 availableiPhone 7 specsWeight: 138gDimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mmOS: iOS 12Screen size: 4.7-inchResolution: 750 x 1334 resolutionCPU: Apple A10 FusionRAM: 2GBStorage: 32/128/256GBBattery: 1,960mAhRear camera: 12MPFront camera: 7MP The overall design of the iPhone 7 is actually rather impressive when you consider some of the changes that have taken place. The waterproofing always adds thickness, as the seals will need some space within the device.The new dual speakers, which fire out of the earpiece and the bottom of the phone, also needed somewhere to go, which starts to explain why the iPhone 7 is 7.1mm thick… the same as the iPhone 6S, and 0.2mm more than the iPhone 6.Perhaps it's something to do with the fact that these features aren't the first of their kind to market, but there's something unexciting about the iPhone 7 being waterproof. It had already been done already by Sony on the Xperia Z and Samsung on the Galaxy S7, and those phones combined impressive design with the reassurance that you could sling them in a lake and still have a working phone.It's still a nice feature to have, but it's one that now in 2019 most high-end phones have, including numerous other iPhones, and one that Android got first.The home button, that iconic design from Apple that's endured throughout the years (up until the newer iPhone X anyway), has changed dramatically too: it's no longer a clickable, physical entity, but a sunken point on the front of the phone that responds to the force of your touch.Initially, it seemed terrible, something that would be impossible to get used to; the loss of the dependable, pressable button was awful, and we kept getting no response when trying to get back to the home screen from within an app.But then suddenly it clicked (well, not physically), and it felt like a completely natural motion. After a while we forgot what was happening, and when you remember that nothing is moving beneath your finger it's quite an odd sensation.Despite the same / slightly higher prices (UK readers can thank Brexit for that one), Apple has doubled the storage sizes on offer with the new iPhone, with 32GB, 128GB and 256GB options. While it's nice to have a microSD card to be able to move files on and off your phone, these new capacities kind of put the debate over why the iPhone doesn't have expandable storage to bed – it's not needed any more.The overall design of the iPhone 7 wasn't anything new really even at launch – unless you're looking at the jet black version. This darker version has the antenna bands colored in, a black iPhone logo and a weird shine to the plastic.It's kind of like an iPhone 5C was given the Pretty Woman treatment, if that makes any sense.This model does scratch very easily though, so you'll need to sling it in a case the second you get your hands on it… which rather defeats the object of owning it in the first place.The iPhone's design hasn't changed a great deal from the 6S, with the only significant alterations other than the loss of the headphone socket being the larger and more protruding camera lens, and the two speaker grilles at the bottom of the phone.These dual grilles are deceptive though – only one actually fires out sound, while the other is entirely aesthetic, perhaps trying to distract us from the lack of the headphone jack.As it's so similar to the iPhone 6S, it's familiar for most iPhone users. The screen is a little hard to reach with one thumb, but not overly so – and the strong build quality in the volume and silencer switch is still as evident as ever.Apple knows how to put together a smartphone, and it's done so effortlessly again here, but if you want a 'budget' iPhone with a more modern design you might want to check out the iPhone XR - though note that it's substantially more expensive than this phone.You can always protect your phone with one of the best iPhone 7 casesScreen25% brightness boost and more colors are hard to spotSharpness is still far lower than competitorsContrast ratio for movie watching could be betterThe main change to the screen on the iPhone 7 is the brightness and color, as it's otherwise identical. The same 4.7-inch 1334 x 750 resolution display is on offer here, meaning that if you hold it side by side with something like the Galaxy S7 Edge, you'll notice the lack of sharpness.However, in day to day use you won't notice much wrong with the screen at all, as even at the HD resolution on offer you've still got a decent amount of pixels, so internet browsing and movie watching is still clean, clear and crisp enough.There's also 3D Touch in the mix again – it's an identical system to that on the iPhone 6S, where the handset can detect the amount of pressure your finger is exerting on the screen. We were promised loads of apps that make use of this, but while most icons will do something when force is exerted, it's not often very useful.How you view this screen depends on what phone you're coming from on – if it's the iPhone 6 or lower, then you'll love the display, as it's brighter, more colorful and just as crisp as before. If, however, you're moving from certain Android handsets, then you might struggle with the lower res, as even many budget Android phones have 1080p screens, and side by side there is a drop.This is where Apple sets out its stall when it comes to its screens: it's not about the sharpness, or the number of nits of brightness – it's how the display looks when it's in your hands that matters.And to that end, the iPhone 7 is a step forward from the 6S. The screen is more colorful – not in an overpowering technicolor way, but just in terms of richness, with the depth of color matching that of the 'cinema screen' according to Apple. It's a hard metric to test, but the color quality is certainly high.The brightness is also improved in the right way – again, it's not overpowering, but more of an upgrade in the right way, giving you an easier look at the screen when it's as bright as it can go.The iPhone 7 on the top vs the iPhone 6S on the bottomThe white balance of the display is also improved to a warmer tone – there were rumors that Apple was going to be using the same True Tone display as seen in newer iPads.One thing Apple badly needs to sort out, though, is its auto brightness feature. The current setup is to blind you if you look at the phone in the dark, where other phones are more adept at dropping right down to the lowest possible brightness to save you from burning out your retinas.Apple will maintain that it's done enough with the screen to make it a great viewing experience without packing in too many pixels and forcing the battery to work hard unnecessarily.To a degree that's right, but in truth if this is the best that can be done on battery life then it's something of a problem, as the iPhone 7 isn't stellar at all in that department.That's the feeling that comes across when watching movies on the new iPhone: it's fine, but nothing special. The contrast ratios don't feel as clear and crisp as on some other phones - including newer iPhones - and the size is a little small compared to others.Perhaps that's an unfair criticism. The size of the screen is precisely what attracts some people, and as such it's presumably acceptable for media.However, the size of the phone should be able to accommodate a larger display, pushing closer to the edge of the handset rather than the amount of bezel used. Of course, it's terribly naive to just say things like 'make the screen bigger!' 'Put in more battery!' 'Shove in more pixels!' as everything is a trade-off.But, as other brands seem to have managed it, it seems that thinner bezels are at least possible.Talking of watching movies, the dual speakers that Apple has popped into the new iPhone are a real upgrade. The location at the top and bottom is a little weird, given that they fire in different directions, but the sound quality is much better than before.They don't have the impressive sound quality of the speakers on the iPad Pro, but that has extra chambers and four speakers, so that's understandable.The audio is a little on the tinny side, but for just showing off a YouTube video or watching a movie in a quiet room they're more than fine. It's not a perfect setup for listening to music – there needs to be more bass for that – but Apple has pushed things forward well here.iPhone 7 tips and tricks: how to make the most of your new iPhone",,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/iphone-7-1327947/review,Gareth Beavis

Spinning off from OPPO, the company went on to release five smartphones in 2018 and received an immensely positive response as far as sales go. Considering the brand was in its infancy, it went on to sell one million units in just five months since launch, a first for any smartphone brand in India.On Monday, March 4, the smartphone company announced its new product in India, Realme 3. The smartphone targets the sub-Rs 10,000 segments, a market spot that’s been largely captured by Xiaomi. Is Realme 3 capable of enough to eat a larger chunk of the pie and can it carve a space of its own? We find out.Realme 3 price and release dateRealme 3 starts at Rs 8,999 for the variant with 3GB RAM and 32GB storage and Rs 10,990 for 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage variant. The phone will go on sale in India starting March 12 on Flipkart.DesignAs smartphone manufacturers realized that they could double down on the design of the rear panel of a phone to stand out from the crowd, they began unleashing their creativity and we all have been subjected to numerous different looking phones in the low to mid-range smartphone segment. Realme 3 arrives in such a time with its own take on the gradient-style design on the back, which has become a popular go-to solution for many OEMs. It will be available in three colour options, Dynamic Black, Radiant Blue and Regular Black.The Realme 3 resorts to a unibody design crafted from a polycarbonate shell which gives it a thickness of 8.3mm and the whole phone weigh around 175g. The unibody design allows for a more comfortable grip when using the phone and its contour edges fit perfectly in the palm of the hand. We used the Radiant Blue variant of the Realme 3 but also managed to get our hands on the Dynamic Black color variant. The difference between both of them is that the Radiant Blue version of the phone pops-out more while the Dynamic Black Realme 3 looks more sophisticated and chic.The blue color variant has a coating of a silver layer on the back cover which is the reason behind the extreme reflective nature of this variant. It is further coated using non-conductive vacuum metalizing (NCVM) technique to layer the green and blue inks. The Dynamic Black isn’t so reflective but has a very beautiful gradient that’s a mix of black and blue with a slight tinge of purple. Topping that up with pearl powder gives a kind of depth to the rear panel.  While using the blue variant, we noticed paint chipping off near the USB port and while it didn’t affect a large area, the durability of such paint-jobs do raise a question in the long run.Realme has utilized the CNC milling process to drill port cutouts on the Realme 3. The back of the phone is also home to a camera module and a fingerprint sensor. There are two yellow rings accentuating the primary camera module, making it a more distinctive part of the phone as a whole. The fingerprint scanner does its job efficiently and we didn’t face any issues setting it up. Overall, the phone feels solid in hand and with the two colour options, the Realme 3 does stand out in terms of looks.DisplayFeaturing a 6.22-inch HD+ (1520 x 720 pixels) display topped with Gorilla Glass 3, the Realme 3 continues with the waterdrop-style notch on the front. This gives it a 19:9 aspect ratio and makes for 88.30% screen-to-body ratio.The bezels, especially the chin is a bit wider than what’s being offered by the competition. In regular use, the display is good enough to watch videos and play games. It produces rich colours, has decent viewing angles but with a slight blue tint running throughout the panel. It’s an HD+ panel which doesn’t allow much clarity, so comparing it with AMOLED is just not fair enough.The waterdrop-style notch offers more screen estate than the regular notch design. It also adds to the inclusiveness of the display making it appear as a part of the phone.For its asking price, the display on the Realme 3 is at par with what’s being offered in the market.Also Read: Hands on: Redmi Note 7 Pro review",,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/realme-3,Siddharth Chauhan

52,,2019-05-20T17:54:31Z,2QtVfJxFsQdc6rWooJCLN3,"You’re spoilt for choice if you’re looking for an affordable phone that doesn’t cost lots in 2019, and the latest attempt to offer that is the Realme 3 Pro.Originally part of Oppo, Realme split from its parent firm in May 2018 and has since been producing handsets to sell in both China and India. It sits in both a similar price and spec bracket to the Honor 8X, which one of the best cheap phones at the moment.The Realme 3 Pro is the first phone from the company to land in the UK – including a variety of other European countries – but there’s currently no insight on whether it’ll be available in Australia or the US.Realme 3 Pro release date and priceYou’ll be able to buy the phone in the UK from June 5, but so far we’ve only heard of it being available on Realme’s website. It doesn’t seem like any retailers or networks have picked up the handset to sell yet.There’s no release date information for the US and Australia. We’ve asked if it’ll be available in either of those countries, and we’ll be sure to update you with further information if it is.As for price, that’s where this phone is interesting. The basic version is set to cost £175 (about $220, AU$320) with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, while the 6GB of RAM and 128GB version will be a touch more at £219 (about $280, AU$400).Design and displayImage 1 of 3Image 2 of 3Image 3 of 3The Realme 3 doesn't immediately feel like a premium handset like the 'Pro' name suggests, but its build quality seems to be high considering the handset's price.The rear of the phone feels a little cheap to the touch as you tap around on the back, but it has a metal edge, and from the front it looks similar to a lot of other phones.The rear cover has a gradient effect, which is something we've gotten used to on handsets but it offers a different look than just a block color choice.The version of the phone pictured here is the Nitro Blue, and there's also a Lightning Purple variant that has a mixture of the aforementioned color and black mixed together.It gives the phone a different effect in a variety of lighting scenarios, and it's an attractive look. There's a fingerprint scanner on the rear of the phone, too.Around the edges you'll find the power button on the right and the volume buttons on the left hand side of the phone.The bottom edge is home to a 3.5mm headphone jack – allowing you to listen to wired headsets wherever you are – as well as a speaker and a microUSB port to charge up the device.We would have preferred this handset to use the more popular USB-C port, and this is likely one way the company has kept the unite price lower than some of the competition. OS and specsThe Realme 3 Pro comes running the latest Android 9 Pie software, but it looks very different to what you're used to seeing on other Android phones.It's called Color OS, which is a popular overlay in China. While it offers a clean user interface it can be considered a bit childish by some who have used it in the past.Inside the phone is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 chipset, which in our limited testing has proved fast enough to load all of the apps we've tried. You may struggle slightly with some intensive games, but we won't know that for sure until the time of our full review.You'll either have 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage or 6GB of RAM with 128GB of space. Both of those versions have support for microSD cards up to 256GB.Camera and batteryWe've yet to be able to properly test the camera on the Realme 3 Pro, but some of the shots we've seen the phone take have been impressive.On the rear is a 16MP f/1.7 shooter with a 5MP depth sensor paired with it for bokeh effects and a variety of other features.The phone is capable of slow-mo video and 4K video recording as well, and there's also a powerful 25MP front-facing camera for selfies.The battery inside the Realme 3 Pro is a whopping 4045mAh, which should make it last awhile – ideally over a day. It comes with fast-charging capabilities, but there's no wireless charging here.Early verdictWe need to do quite a bit more testing before we find out whether the Realme 3 Pro is worth your money, but on paper this is an impressive phone. It's genuinely quite remarkable what the company is offering here for the price.Even in our limited testing time the phone has impressed us, and considering how low the price is it may well soon become one of our favorite cheap phones.Read our Xiaomi Mi 9 review",Hands on: Realme 3 Pro review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/realme-3-pro,James Peckham
53,,2019-04-11T15:56:35Z,rKmKhacg45h6g2oyxEBrHj,"Meet the Samsung Galaxy A30, one of the middle childs in the A series, between the Samsung Galaxy A20 and Galaxy A50. At MWC 2019, went hands-on with the A30 and A50.These are the more affordable alternatives to the pricier Galaxy S flagships – and while they're good to look at, in some ways they're lacking. That's expected given the anticipated much cheaper price.Galaxy A series family: Galaxy A80 | Galaxy A70 | Galaxy A50 | Galaxy A40Samsung Galaxy A30 release date and priceWe haven't been told an official release date or price for A30 in the US and the UK, other than that it'll cost between €200 (roughly $230, £175) and €300 (around $340, £260). However, in Australia, the Samsung Galaxy A30 is available to buy now for AU$379 from Samsung directly or from leading retailers.We'll keep you updated when we find out more about the price and availability in other markets.Samsung Galaxy A30 design and displayThe Samsung Galaxy A30 is a rather wide budget phone – its large screen made it feel like a plus-sized handset. It was very light to hold and rather thin, at only 7.7mm thickness, however we were also told the A50 was 7.7mm, and that felt even thinner.The look fits 2019 standards, with a bezel reduced display, though it doesn't actually have the glass back or aluminum frame of the Galaxy S10 series. It's polymer on back with a plastic silver-painted frame. It at least looks convincing.The 6.4-inch Infinity-U AMOLED display was very vibrant, with colors popping and contrasting well – it's undoubtedly a good-looking device, and would be great for watching videos.Samsung Galaxy A30 (left) vs Samsung Galaxy A50 (right) (Image credit: TechRadar)The large screen was broken only by a small notch cutout at the top, popularly called a 'teardrop notch', and it's used to house the selfie-cam. That said, even with all of that free real screen estate up top, it felt as though the notification icons were a little small.At the bottom of the device was a 3.5mm headphone jack, which we are always happy to see, and it also comes with a USB-C connection. The power and volume buttons on the side of the device felt a little too high up to use comfortably, as did the rear fingerprint sensor, which is an issue that comes with the size of the device, but depending on how you hold your device this may not be a problem.Upon release, the A30 will be available in four colors – black, white, blue and red, although we only saw it in black and white.Image 1 of 2Image credit: TechRadarImage 2 of 2Image credit: TechRadarSamsung Galaxy A30 cameraOn paper, the Samsung Galaxy A30 is quite an impressive budget phone for photography. It has a rear dual-lens camera consisting of a 16MP main sensor with an f/1.7 aperture, and 5MP ultra-wide lens with a f/2.2 aperture. The ultra-wide lens has the same encompassing 123 degree field of view as the Galaxy S10 series. The front of the phone has a 16MP selfie cam.As will all Samsung phones, the camera's user interface was very easy to use, with all effects and options easy to find and a very quick shutter speed capturing moments quickly.These effects were a little disappointing, however – during our demo Live Focus mode often blurred too much or too little, and the Auto Selfie function, through which we were supposed to be able to take a selfie just by waving our hand, rarely worked as intended. We couldn't see the Scene Optimizer effect having any noticeable difference, but we'd need to use this feature in a variety of locations to make a final decision on its usefulness.The pictures themselves were nothing fantastic, as they seemed to have quite low contrast and were a little too washed out compared to other phone cameras, but the images weren't terrible and would be fine for everyday use like social media and video chat. Bear in mind we only tested it in one environment, so when we check out the camera for our full review we'll be able to put it in different situations to see how well it takes pictures.Samsung Galaxy A30 batteryWith a sizable battery capacity of 4,000mAh, the Samsung Galaxy A30 will easily last you a day and it's almost as big as the 4,100mAh battery in the tremendously more expensive Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus.Of course, the actual lifespan of a battery depends on how well the software and chipset is optimized, and how you use the device. So we'll test it thoroughly when we get our hands on it for a full Samsung Galaxy S30 review.The handset supports fast charging of 15W, which is fairly fast, although nothing compared to the wireless charging capabilities of some of the S10 devices, like the S10 Plus 5G's 25W wireless charging.Samsung Galaxy A30 specs and featuresImage credit: TechRadarWhen we played around with the Samsung Galaxy A30's Android 9 operating system, we found it smooth to use, opening apps and navigating menus with ease. Of course we'll need to put the phone through its paces for our full review to see how well it runs, but when we ran a quick benchmark check we found it to have a multi-core speed of 4,103. This is similar to the Pixel XL, which was released in 2016, although that was a premium device upon release.At launch, the phone will be released in two sizes – one with 32GB of internal storage and 3GB RAM, and a larger 64GB/4GB configuration. It also supports microSD cards, in case you need more storage.This is nothing breathtaking, and the low memory may be a problem for some people who use many apps or download media, but we're expecting the device to launch for a low price that'll justify its lower memory.Early verdictThe Samsung Galaxy A30 is a cheaper alternative to the pricey Galaxy S10 phones, without all of the flagship-level bells and whistles. It has a sizable screen, a hefty battery for all-day usage, and a dual-lens rear camera with an ultra-wide field of view. At MWC, the software ran smoothly, and we're hoping to get this budget phone in for more testing, particularly to check out the camera in a different environment. It faces a lot of new budget phone competition in 2019, so we'll see if Samsung has enough to compete with Chinese manufacturers, like it does on its higher-end devices.MWC (Mobile World Congress) is the world's largest showcase for the mobile industry, stuffed full of the newest phones, tablets, wearables and more.

It leads the current pack of the refreshed A-series with features like three cameras, u-shaped notch design and a 4,000mAh battery. Then, there’s the in-display fingerprint sensor which is a distinct feature seen on more premium phones. This only increases the Galaxy A50’s value-for-money quotient. The A50 lands at a price point that’s majorly dominated by Xiaomi’s most affordable flagship smartphone, the POCO F1, Nokia 7.1 and OPPO K1, the only other phone with an in-display fingerprint sensor, south of 20,000INR.As such, the Galaxy A50 has a lot to prove for it to be considered as a serious contender in the sub-Rs 25,000 budget segment.Samsung Galaxy A50 release date and priceThe Galaxy A50 retails starting at Rs 19,990 for the variant with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage. It is also available with 6GB of RAM for Rs 22,990. Interested buyers can choose between Black, White and Blue colour options. The phone is available to purchase from Amazon India, Samsung India Store and offline stores.DesignPicking up the Galaxy A50 in hand, it immediately feels very polished. The phone has a sandwich-type chassis design with polycarbonate edges that co-joins the screen and the back panel. While the company has gone with a notched display that should effectively narrow-down bezels, they are fairly noticeable, especially at the chin. The rear panel is where Samsung has done some real magic.

57,,2019-03-06T04:55:32Z,5FwCmCUgH7NjfLvM7dm5iB,"After months of hinting, Samsung finally launched two new smartphones under its new 'Made for Millenials' Galaxy M-Series- the Samsung Galaxy M10 and the Galaxy M20- in January. Samsung has few phones in the sub-15k and sub-10k categories in India; moreover, these are the first India-specific devices from the company. Clearly, Samsung has decided to target the budget category in the world's second-largest smartphone market.Only time- and our reviews- will tell if they can succeed. We received a Samsung Galaxy M10 device before the official launch. So after using the device for about a week, we reached a few conclusions.Samsung Galaxy M10 pricing and launch dateThe M10 has two storage variants- the basic 2GB RAM + 16GB internal storage version, as well as the 3GB/32GB version. Here, we review the higher storage variant- the 3GB/32GB variant. The smartphone was launched on January 28, and are available online on Amazon India as well as on Samsung's e-shop.Known for its mid-range and premium smartphone and tablets, Samsung clearly hopes to break into India's budget segment with the M-series. After the poor performance of the Galaxy On series, the company will be hoping that the new M-series offerings will find more favour with budget device consumers, who have a slew of other options from Redmi, Oppo, and other brands.As a launch offer, buyers of the Galaxy M10 will be entitled to double-data on certain Jio 4G plans; furthermore, buyers can avail Total Damage Protection at just Rs 699.DesignOn the face of it, The Galaxy M10 looks like a sub-15k rather than a sub-10K one- the combination of the waterdrop notch and thin bezels isn't very common among sub-10K phones. The Redmi 6A, for example, lacks a notch, and has thicker bezels than the M10, which looks closer to its immediate senior, the Galaxy M20. The back panel is made of polycarbonate with a glossy finish, and is curved on all sides, thus fitting snugly in the hand. Unlike other devices in its price range, the M10's finish is not reminiscent of glass. Unlike the M20, there is no fingerprint sensor; there is a speaker grill on the bottom left of the rear panel, however. The dual rear camera module is located to top left- two vertically-aligned sensors, with the LED flash below.Image 1 of 3Image 2 of 3Image 3 of 3 The Samsung Galaxy M10 body has a 7.7mm slim design, and comes in two colours- Charcoal Black and Ocean Blue. It's definitely comfortable to use one-handed. The whole design is pleasing- it doesn't look premium, but it's pretty enough. The left side of the device houses the SIM card tray, while the volume button is on the right. The bottom has a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm audio jackDisplayThe Samsung Galaxy M10 has a 6.2-inch Infinity-V HD+ display, and as far as budget displays go, it's definitely a win. The colours pop beautifully, and while it's a TFT LCD panel, the viewing experience is still good enough to pass muster. The outdoor visibility is sharp and bright, and the colours don't lose much of their vividness. If you compare to an FHD or AMOLED panel, of course it's going to fall short, but it's more than adequate given the price tag. The waterdrop notch is unobtrusive in its size, and houses the selfie camera. At the bottom is a thick chin. Videos look good on the M10 display, and Widevine L1 certification means you can  stream HD content through a number of streaming apps.The M10 display is good; perhaps even great, at its price point. Also Read: Hands on: Samsung Galaxy M30 review",Samsung Galaxy M10 review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-m10,Malavika Subramanyan
58,,2019-02-01T09:26:48Z,PtHkLCnqvDSgaA8jWz88vM,"In the last quarter of 2018, Samsung dropped hints at its youth-centric approach with the release of Galaxy A7 and A9. Moving ahead on its ""made for millennials"" route, the giant has launched two new smartphones under its freshly introduced M-series - Galaxy M10 and M20. Out of the two handsets, the M20 is a slightly better proposition with more features and better internals. For those unaware, the Galaxy M20 is posed against the budget handsets from Redmi and similar in India. It's a sub 15K phone that's said to replace the On-series handsets from the company. Undeniably, Samsung's intent of making it a complete handset is visible on paper, but does it work the same way in real life usage? We have been using the Galaxy M20 from a week before the launch and testing it to see if it matches up to the hype that's been around the phone from a while. The Galaxy M20 has a glossy and smooth backSamsung Galaxy A8+ price and release dateSamsung Galaxy M20 is priced at Rs 10,990 for the variant with 3GB RAM and 32GB storage while the high-end variant with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage will retail for Rs 12,990. It will be available on Amazon India and Samsung India Store from February 5. As part of a launch offer by Jio, buyers of new Galaxy M20 will be entitled to double-data offer on Jio 4G.DesignFace up, the Galaxy M20 looks nearly identical to recently launched budget phones like Honor 10 Lite and Realme U1 with a water drop notch and thin bezels. That said, the phone brings along a completely new, but very basic design from Samsung this time. It's nowhere close to the J-series or the On series handsets that we've seen in the past. The phone gets a polycarbonate body which undoubtedly feels good to hold. The finish is glossy and smooth to touch, and it does not imitate glass like most phones in its range. It is curved on all sides, making it fit in your hand perfectly. It has an oval fingerprint sensor, placed in the center back, which is easy to reach. The Galaxy M20 is 180 grams as it packs a 5000mAh battery, but that doesn't make the body thick. We would say it's not the best design from Samsung or in its own league, but it's practical and one of the few phones that fit pleasingly well in hand. Samsung is not going for the most premium looks here, and it doesn't need to either. The material and finish are impressive, it fits superbly well in hand, doesn't catch fingerprint, isn't prone to cracking and slides into pockets like water. After all, this, if it doesn't imitate a premium phone, it's ok.The left side of the phone has a SIM card tray and the volume rocker is on the right, while the bottom has a USB Type-C port, a speaker grill and audio jack.Samsung Galaxy M20 image galleryImage 1 of 5Image 2 of 5Image 3 of 5Image 4 of 5Image 5 of 5DisplayThe display of the Galaxy M20 is a 6.3-inch FHD+ (2340 x 1080p) PLS TFT panel. PLS (Plane Line Switching) is Samsung's proprietary display design which is similar to IPS (In-Plane Switching) technology. If you're surprised to see the term TFT, it's just the terminology that sounds dated, but Samsung has worked on the PLS technology and it's visible on this device. The display has rich colours, impressive viewing angles and outdoor visibility. It's one of those displays that catch your eye the moment you turn on the phone for the first time. It's adequately sharp and quite bright. However, if you're nitpicking and comparing it to the AMOLED panels on J-series phones by Samsung, then, of course, you won't get the deep blacks and highly saturated colors. As a standalone display, the Galaxy M20 has a good one. It is at par with what the competition is offering.The Samsung Galaxy M20 has a 6.3-inh FHD+ display",Samsung Galaxy M20 review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-m20,Sudhanshu Singh
59,,2019-04-29T12:23:25Z,NrToKooyzTZKccgW8LWc5G,"Samsung Galaxy M30 is the third phone in the company’s millennial-centric M-series which was announced in February 2019. Samsung is also doubling down on its offerings in India as it launched the all-new A-series shortly after the M30.This is largely due to the fact that the company hasn’t been able to stay put in the mid-range smartphone market with a product and much of it is captured by Xiaomi anyway. This doesn’t leave Samsung with many options and as a solution, the company presents us with the Galaxy M-series.For its asking price, the M30 enters the mid-range smartphone segment to challenge Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 7 Pro. But is it able to hold off on its own, we find out.Samsung Galaxy M20 reviewSamsung Galaxy M30 price and release dateSamsung offers the Galaxy M30 in two variants, one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage which is priced at Rs 14,990 and the other with 6GB of RAM and 128GB storage priced at Rs 17,990. The Galaxy M30 is available on Amazon India and Samsung India store.Also Read: Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro reviewDesignThe Galaxy M30 follows the same design language as its younger siblings. It is built from polycarbonate and has a glossy finish on the back. The plastic frame curved around the edges to fit in the display and makes it feel an inherent part of the body.  The rear panel is smooth to touch and the gradient blue and black finish look cool. The triple camera array on the back resides in a module on the top right corner with an accented silver ring over the middle sensor.Overall, the built of the Galaxy M30 feels much similar to the other two phones in this segment. The design is functional, it fits in hand very well and is quite sturdy. Having said that, we would recommend users to put on a case because regular wear and tear shows up as scuff marks after a while.DisplayThe M30 receives an upgrade in the form of a Super AMOLED panel measuring 6.4-inches. It has a Full HD+ (2280 x 1080 pixels) resolution and sports the company’s infinity-U notch design. This makes for a 19.5:9 aspect ratio of the screen. The Galaxy M30 also happens to be the first M-series phone with the u-shaped notch on the front.The notched design is even smaller than the regular waterdrop notch found on the Galaxy M10 or M20. Having said that, the M30 has a distinctively wider chin than the M20. In usage, the Galaxy M30 seems like a good phone to watch videos and listen to music on. The screen leans a bit towards warmer tones but the colours pop out nicely, courtesy of the AMOLED panel. The viewing angles are also great and with maximum brightness, the M30 has excellent sunlight legibility. It comes with Widevine L1 certification and also supports Dolby ATMOS over headphones. Rest assured, we had a good time binging over Netflix on the M30.CameraThe three camera setup on the M30 consists of a primary 13MP sensor with an f/1.9 aperture coupled with a 5MP depth-sensor and a 5MP ultra-wide angle sensor that enables a 123-degree field of view. Photography enthusiasts can play around with the wide-angle camera for some landscape imagery but one shouldn’t expect too much. Just be content that a phone offers a wide-angle sensor in the mid-range segment. In our usage, the Galaxy M30 faces similar problems in the camera department as the M20. The wide-angle pictures we took had more of the scene in the frame but sadly failed in detail retention. Regular pictures felt a bit over-saturated while the clarity and sharpness went for a toss.As we also noted in our review of the M20, the camera works best in natural light and anything below that leads to sub-par pictures. This holds true of the M30 as well. In low light, the camera is unable to reproduce the kind of clarity the competition is capable of and is marred by noise.The key upgrade on the M30 over M20 is the addition of the depth sensor which assists the primary sensor in creating images with depth-of-field. On the front, the 16MP camera is below average and fine tunes the images way too much resulting in loss of detail and a bit washed out selfies.Samsung Galaxy M30 Camera sample galleryImage 1 of 17Image 2 of 17Image 3 of 17Image 4 of 17Image 5 of 17Image 6 of 17Image 7 of 17Image 8 of 17Image 9 of 17Image 10 of 17Image 11 of 17Image 12 of 17Image 13 of 17Image 14 of 17Image 15 of 17Image 16 of 17Image 17 of 17",Samsung Galaxy M30 review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-m30,Siddharth Chauhan

Samsung is also doubling down on its offerings in India as it launched the all-new A-series shortly after the M30.This is largely due to the fact that the company hasn’t been able to stay put in the mid-range smartphone market with a product and much of it is captured by Xiaomi anyway. This doesn’t leave Samsung with many options and as a solution, the company presents us with the Galaxy M-series.For its asking price, the M30 enters the mid-range smartphone segment to challenge Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 7 Pro.

62,,2019-01-17T16:25:18Z,B4xRn2qZyBnyzjgtgeRMx3,"Update: The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 has been steadily dropping in price, but it now has some newer competition too. We've added details of both these things to this review.Even in 2019, the Galaxy Note 8 remains one of Samsung's biggest phones, and does more than enough to right the major wrongs of the recalled Note 7. This is a mega-sized mea culpa.We've tested the Note 8 for many months and it's even more interesting today thanks to the new Deep Sea Blue color that came out post-launch in the US and UK, and the big Android Oreo update that it got. This catches it up to the Samsung Galaxy S9 and similarly sized Galaxy S9 Plus.After all of our hands on time with the Note 8 it has us convinced: this is a true redesign of not just the Note series, but of the average smartphone from top-to-bottom, edge-to-edge, and rear camera to, well, rear camera. There are now two cameras on the back, a first for a Samsung flagship smartphone (the new S9 Plus and Samsung Galaxy Note 9 has this too). It takes brilliant portrait photos, and you can even edit the depth of field post-capture.What makes the Note 8 different is the handy S Pen stylus and larger 6.3-inch ‘Infinity Display’ to work with – but one that doesn’t increase the dimensions of the actual phone too much. The phone acts like a big, borderless glass canvas for your important handwritten notes and masterpiece doodles.Watch our video review of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 below. Why buy this instead of the 6.2-inch Galaxy S9 Plus? The extra tenth of an inch of screen is insignificant and doesn’t matter, but Note fans adore the S Pen stylus functionality and its more square shape. Over the S8 Plus, the Note 8 also benefits power users with 6GB or RAM and a superior dual-lens camera, both features passed on to the S9 Plus.Of course, it's not quite a match for the Samsung Galaxy Note 9, but given its lower price it doesn't have to be.This is still one of the most powerful Samsung phones with a stylus. It does, however, cost you in multiple ways. First, it’s too big for some. You’re going to need a Note 8 case to confidently hold this unwieldy glass beast, and two hands to operate it.Second, the big screen also comes at the cost of the Note’s usual oval-shaped fingerprint sensor home button. It’s gone. The on-screen button that replaces it works fine, but the fingerprint sensor is now located on the back of the device and off-center – it’s a textbook flawed design, and the alternative iris scanner doesn’t always work when you want to unlock the phone. We're hoping the Galaxy Note 9 fixes this in a couple of months.Then there’s the Note 8 price. While not as expensive as it once was, this is still a pricey phone.Can your wallet, and the extent of your grip, handle the Note 8? That’s pretty much all that you – if you have faith in Samsung again – need to ask yourself before buying this phone.Price and release dateLaunched at $929 (£869, AU$1,499)Now costs around $715 (£475, AU$900)Out now in the US, UK and AustraliaThe Galaxy Note 8 release date was Friday, September 15 2017 in the US and UK, while Australia got the new phone on September 22. It's readily available.Note 8 on the rightThe official Note 8 price is $929 (£869, AU$1,499), but many stores now sell it for far less. You can find it cheaper via Amazon US for example, with prices now coming in at around $715 (£475, AU$900).It's still pricey, but no longer anywhere near what it once was. Of course, it's no longer the latest Note, as the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 is now available.Design and display6.3-inch 'Infinity Display' redefines the Note look and feelBut it's 9mm taller than any previous NoteWater-resistant up to 1.5m (5ft) for 30 minutesThe Note 8 maximizes Samsung’s dual curved edge and nearly bezel-less Infinity Display to the point where this phone feels like a mini tablet from the future. It’s impressive-looking, but also big and heavy – 9mm taller than any previous Note phone, and 195g.Stretching your fingers is well worth if you can physically manage it. Its expansive 6.3-inch display – now without a physical home button – has an unheard-of 83% screen-to-body ratio. The iPhones have a 67% screen-to-body ratio for comparison. That's a lot less screen for such big phones, at least until iPhone 8 arrives to change everything. Samsung keeps topping itself, launching phones with the world’s best display every six months. Its maximum brightness, 3K resolution with Mobile HDR Premium, and wider color gamut are hard for anyone else to compete with. It's Always-On Display continues to be an appealing feature in a smartphone.Lit up, the all-screen Note 8 feels like we’re carrying around a piece of light when we’re out and about. It's much better than the Pixel 2 and Pixel 2 XL display, Google's biggest weakness.The entire front glows with unimpeded information – as long as you don’t drop and crack it, and you’ll need to be extra careful as the entire phone is enveloped in glass wrapped around an aluminum frame. Combined with its size, this makes for one slippery smartphone.While we spent most of the time using this phone naked (that’s without a case), we did test several Note 8 cases and instantly felt more confident carrying it around. Why? The added grip (and peace of mind) let us operate it with one hand, whereas we struggled with the pure glass body at such tall and wide dimensions. Sorry – you’re going to need a case with this phone.There were very few Note 8 colors at launch. It came in muted tones of Midnight Black and Orchid Gray and we only recently saw the Deep Sea Blue color launch in the US. This vibrant blue and tempting Maple Gold colors were first launched in other regions. Samsung, annoyingly, refreshes its phones with new colors after a few months, much to the chagrin of loyal early adopters.You also won’t get the best sound from the Note 8. It's a multimedia powerhouse visually, but its bottom-firing speaker still had us cupping the bottom of the phone to get better audio. Samsung has yet to deliver dual front-facing speakers like the Sony Xperia XZ Premium, or customizable Hi-Fi audio like the LG V30. Maybe next year.The Note 8 is IP68 water-resistant, so it can survive up to 1.5m (5ft) underwater for 30 minutes, and it uses the reversible USB-C standard. Both are new perks for most Note fans. There’s also no camera bump, and that gaudy Samsung logo has been moved to the rear, no longer staring you in the face. Unfortunately, the fingerprint sensor has moved there, too.The fingerprint sensor has marginally improvedNo physical home button means a rear fingerprint sensorIt's further away from the camera vs the S8 and S8 Plus sensorIris scanner and face unlock are poor substitutes We hate the fingerprint sensor on the Galaxy Note 8, just as we did on the S8 and S8 Plus. Maybe a tiny bit less, but we still don’t like its off-center rear location for the same reason: we keep blindly smudging the far-too-close dual-lens camera. It’s really difficult to unlock the phone.Still awkwardWhat’s improved – slightly? The offset fingerprint sensor and center-aligned camera are a few milimeters further away from each other. Samsung wisely moved the flash and heart rate monitor in between the sensor (which requires your fingerprints) and the camera (which always gets fingerprint smudges all over it). That built-in heart rate monitor you forget still existed on Samsung phones now serves a purpose again.Samsung’s unlocking alternatives don’t work as advertised. Face unlock has proven to be less secure, so much so that we don’t even suggest using it. And while you won’t fool the iris scanner, it won’t recognize you wearing sunglasses, or walking and holding the phone at the improper distance.It’s ironic that we have a phone that looks like it comes from the future, yet it’s been designed with a fingerprint sensor that’s become a textbook design misfire on smartphones. Samsung could fix this issue with an in-glass front fingerprint sensor, but the technology isn’t ready yet. Expect this to be a grand announcement for the Galaxy S9 or Note 9 – please act surprised.The S Pen is full of new and old tricksEasy to sign documents and write directly on screenshotsNote-taking expands with convenient off-screen memosLive Messages, GIF Capture add fun to this productivity toolThere are two types of people in the world – those who will use the Note 8’s S Pen, and those who think they’re going to use it, but will stop taking it out of its holster after about a week. It’s like everyone’s desire to own a Fitbit – you had good intentions when you set out to buy it.Anyone who sticks with the S Pen, however, will get their money’s worth from the Note 8. We signed a PDF contract last week without having to print or scan it – in fact, we didn’t even have to leave the email app. We also jotted down handwritten notes and took screenshots that we were instantly able to mark up.Plus the S Pen is also great for sketching with over 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity.These features – usually reserved for pro-level tablets or 2-in-1 computers – are even handier on a phone. After all, the best note-taking device is the one you have with you all the time.Frequent note-takers will love the off-screen memo feature, which lets you jot down white-ink notes on the turned-off black screen as soon as you eject the S Pen. Off-screen memos, introduced with the doomed Note 7, enable you to capture your thoughts without having to unlock the phone first.The Note 7 also debuted S Pen features like GIF Capture and Translate, but these will be new to most Note 8 users. And new to the Note 8 is the ability to write out ‘Live Messages’, creating sparkly animations that you can send to anyone in GIF form. If the S Pen lets you skip a few archaic steps – like printing, finding a working pen, and scanning a document – the Note 8 may be worth the extra $105 over the similarly sized S8 Plus if you can't find a good deal.",Samsung Galaxy Note 8 review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-8-review,Matt Swider
63,,2019-03-18T09:34:05Z,4gCytpyJwnnJuQ2oGyURJ3,"The Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus is one of the few flagship smartphones that many of us had our eyes on. Being the tenth generation model of Samsungs most innovative and advanced smartphone series, the Galaxy S10 Plus comes with high expectations, especially when its predecessor was an iterative, or rather an unexciting upgrade over the Galaxy S8. As expected, the company released three models - Galaxy S10, Galaxy S10e and the bigger and better Galaxy S10 Plus. The Galaxy S10e is Samsung's take on covering the 50K price bracket, while the S10 is for those who like a more handy phone or need to save some cash by taking a cut on the battery, screen size and front camera. The Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus is the superior version like all Plus variants across brands. As the name suggests, it's slightly bigger and offers a massive 6.4-inch edge-to-edge display with Samsung's new 'punch-hole' design for front cameras.There's a lot to like about the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus and very little to dislike.Read our Samsung Galaxy S10 reviewRead our Samsung Galaxy S10e reviewRead our Samsung Galaxy S10 5G reviewAnd here's all you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy FoldSo what makes the Galaxy S10 Plus an interesting upgrade?The first thing is its immersive edge-to-edge display with 93.1% screen-to-body-ratio with slightly curved sides. It also gets a new in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor under the glass. A huge 4100mAh battery with Wireless Powershare feature, which is capable of reverse charging smartphones that have wireless charging support. Moreover, the three cameras on the rear make for a versatile camera setup where the newly added wide angle lens is just magical. There's also a telephoto lens that lets you take advantage of detailed close-ups from a distance. The design shares a resemblance with the Galaxy S-series, but it's neither similar nor boring. It looks stunning and has premium written all over the body.  Image Credit: TechRadarSamsung Galaxy S10 Plus price and release dateThe new Galaxy S10 Plus was unveiled on February 20 at an Unpacked event held in Barcelona, Spain. Interested buyers can now buy the Galaxy S10 Plus in India all the variants of the phone are available across online stores as well as in brick-and-mortar shops.Its 128GB variant is priced at Rs 73,900 and comes in black, white and blue colours.Want more internal storage? The 512GB storage variant of the phone also comes in the ceramic finish and will retail at Rs 91,900.Samsung is also bringing its top-of-the-line Galaxy S10 Plus 1TB storage variant which is priced at Rs 1,17,900 and comes in a beautiful ceramic built with white and black color options to pick from. Samsung calls the 'Ultimate Performance Edition'. It packs in a mammoth 12GB of RAM and huge 1TB of storage.The smartphone is on open sale from March 8th across all platforms. Image Credit: TechRadar(Image: © TechRadar)DisplaySamsung Galaxy S10 Plus specsWeight: 175gDimensions: 157.6 x 74.1 x 7.8mmOS: Android 9Screen size: 6.4-inchResolution: QHD+CPU: Exynos 9820RAM: 8GB/12GBStorage: 128/512GB/1TBBattery:  4,100mAhRear camera: 16MP + 12MP + 12MPFront camera: 10MP + 8MP The Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus has a 6.4-inch AMOLED display over S9 Plus' 5.8-inch display and equal to the one we saw on the Galaxy Note 9. The top and bottom bezels have got a cut, resulting in 93.1% screen-to-body ratio. As we all know, Samsung is one of the few OEMs that avoided using notch on their flagships last year and went with a new Infinity-O display that has a laser-cut hole in the top right corner.The dual 'punch-hole' camera. (Image Credit: TechRadar)In a bid to achieve more and more screen to body ratio, OEMs are now cutting down on the size of the notch and using a pop-up camera. But punch-hole is the latest trend that's caught up lately as an alternative to the notch. While the smaller S10 has a circular hole in the display, the S10 Plus has a capsule-like hole in order to reside two lenses. The notch is placed on the right where you usually see icons like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and mobile signal, and the all-important battery life percentage. I personally didn't find it distracting or weird for that matter. At least it looks different from the rest of the phone with the notch design. Also note that the two front cameras fall in the notification bar area, which means they don't get in the way while consuming content, browsing web and similar. While you're gaming, a black bar is applied to that area similar to how it is done on phones with a notch. Since it's a high-resolution AMOLED, the blacks are so deep that it effectively makes the hole disappear. The 6.4-inch QHD+ display looks great. (Image Credit: TechRadar)The Galaxy S10 Plus screen boasts a 1440 x 3040 QHD+ resolution, which is stretched over the tall 19:9 aspect ratio and provides a pin-sharp 526ppi pixel density – in short, this is a big, highly detailed display.Similar to the last generation flagship, Samsung keeps the default screen resolution to Full HD+ (2280 x 1080p). It's done to conserve battery power, but you can always maximize the resolution to high from the quick toggles. FHD+ is an apt resolution for a display so good, especially when it is able to automatically adapt to higher settings when you load up a 4K movie or a graphic greedy game.HDR10+ support is a huge addition, which also makes it the first phone with this capability. HDR10+ basically enhances the contrast and color of the picture output to make it look rich and crisp. It's an important perk for movie buffs.It is not a completely bezel-less display as there is still a considerable black area at the top and bottom of the screen. But it has elegantly curved edges, letting pixels stretch over both the edges. However, we did find out that the smaller bezels lead to more accidental touches, which gets annoying after a point. It also makes it difficult to play games in landscape mode, especially PUBG Mobile where there are so many action buttons at the edges of the screen. The Infinity-O display is the face of the Galaxy S10 Plus and it looks impressive, with bright, colorful reproduction making it the best for content consumption and gaming at its price.DesignWhile the face is completely new, the back of the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus shares resemblance with its predecessors. However, you'll find subtle improvements and surprises new and old.The frame is aluminum as usual, but it's slightly slimmer than that of the S9 Plus. The front and the back is covered in smooth Gorilla Glass 6 with the glass curved at the edges. It comes in Prism White, Blue and Black, but we chose the White variant for our review.The 512GB and 1TB versions are backed by ceramic instead of glass. They are available in either white or black. Unfortunately, we did not get a chance to have a proper look at it yet, but we'll update it as soon as we get our hands on it.There's a dedicated Bixby button below the volume rocker. (Image Credit: TechRadar)(Image: © TechRadar)The back of the Galaxy S10 Plus is neat and very aesthetic. Especially, the white variant looks stunning with that black colored horizontal camera module in the center. The centralized position of the camera module also helps it sit nicely on the surface. At least, that is what we liked the most on the white variant. The back has a prism-like color changing finish, which is definitely something new but also quite subjective to comment on.Let's also not forget that Samsung continues to offer IP68 certification, making it a dust/water resistant device.Samsung changed completely scrapped the idea of putting the fingerprint sensor on the back this time. The sensor performs an invisible trick, it's now embedded under the glass of the display. After a two-year hiatus, Samsung finally found a solution in Qualcomm's ultrasonic fingerprint technology. The 3D scan of your fingerprint is said to allow for more accurate unlocks and be more secure than the optical scanners on the likes of the Huawei Mate 20 and Vivo V15 Pro.It's not the fastest in-display fingerprint sensor we've used, and that's because optical readers located outside of a display. The unlock animation also makes it look a bit slower, and that is exactly the opposite of what it's supposed to do. Even with that speed, you're looking at no more than a second from placing your finger on the sensor. Also, you need to apply slightly more pressure on the in-display sensor and you can't unlock it without looking at the phone as there's no physical ridge to guide our finger. There's a fingerprint icon on the screen where you keep your finger. Lastly, if you're planning to attach a glass screen protector on the display, make sure you check if the in-display fingerprint sensor works with that on.The good part is that it's more secure and the accuracy has also increased after the last update. It now has more than 90% success rate.If you're not liking the fingerprint experience, you can opt for the less secure but much faster face unlock. It is very fast. There's a fingerprint scanner located just about the home button. (Image Credit: TechRadar)(Image: © TechRadar)The Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus measures 157.6 x 74.1 x 7.8mm, roughly the dimensions of the S9 Plus – the new phone is a bit shorter, a tad wider, and noticeably thinner and lighter – and feels better in the hand than the physically bigger Note 9 with its 83.4% screen-to-body ratio. It feels good in the hand and it's also quite easy to hold with one hand for a ‘Plus’-sized handset. But note that the sleek design with glass on both sides make it an extremely slippery device. We would suggest you to use the plastic case that comes inside the box as it adds enough protection without disturbing the look and feel of the phone. During the hands-on prior to its launch, the first design flaw that we noted was the high placement of the power/lock key. It does not fall under the natural spot where the thumb lands while holding the phone. This might sound like nitpicking for some, but these details matter to others.On the left side, there's a volume rocker and a dedicated Bixby button. Pressing this launches Samsung's assistant immediately, giving you quick access to its features. You might end up hitting the Bixby button accidentally thinking it's the volume down key, but that's only until you get used to the phone. We're glad that Samsung still has a 3.5mm jack despite that sleek body. It's placed right next to the USB Type-C port at the bottom. It's good to see that Samsung retains the decade-old feature on the latest S-series flagship, despite the fact that it's also launching it's wireless Galaxy Buds. Lastly, there's one more factor you must know before you invest in the stunning Galaxy S10 Plus that it's going to cost a bomb if the display is damaged. With that slippery slab of glass comes pressure of keeping it safe. That's a common concern in all such phone, including the new iPhones.",Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-india,Sudhanshu Singh
64,,2019-03-25T06:47:19Z,V2pUGiM4KpqLmBpQfbDB7e,"The Galaxy S10e is Samsung’s flagship phone with 2019 specs and features at 2016 prices, offering you a way to upgrade to almost all of the new ideas inside the Galaxy S10. In this way, the S10e (‘e’ for ‘essential’) is a lot like the Apple iPhone XR, and it’s hard not to see Samsung’s as the ‘budget flagship’ of the iPhone XS line: both pack the best parts of their generation in a phone that’s not quite as svelte or feature-rich as their pricier siblings. But the real competition isn’t between either less-expensive device - it’s between them and their pricier siblings. We found the S10e did enough to forgo the extra perks in the S10 (which is $150/£113/AU$210 more) or the S10 Plus ($250/£189/AU$350 more). Moreover, the S10e’s smaller size will certainly appeal to folks who aren’t fans of the blooming size of flagship phones.Read our Samsung Galaxy S10 reviewRead our Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus reviewRead our hands-on Samsung Galaxy S10 5G reviewAnd here's all you need to know about the Samsung Galaxy FoldThere are compromises for that lower cost, of course. The S10e doesn’t get some of some of the neat features in its pricier siblings, like an in-screen fingerprint sensor, curved screen sides or a telephoto lens. These sorts of features will undoubtedly show up in more handsets in 2019, so it’ll be curious to see if their exclusion gives you flagship phone envy. But we doubt you’ll be too jealous. The Galaxy S10e is a lovely one-hand-friendly phone that with top-of-the-line specs to match. Its 5.8-inch all-screen display is easy to hold and its chipset is fast enough that it’ll compete with other flagships for years to come, even if its compromises in display resolution and camera fall short of the Samsung Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10 Plus.Samsung Galaxy S10e price and release dateThe Samsung Galaxy S10e came out on March 8, 2019 in the US, Canada, Europe, India, China, and other select countries. It’ll roll out to a total of 130 markets by the end of March, though the company hasn’t specified exactly which countries it’ll be available in by then. The Galaxy S10e retails for $749 / £669 / AU$1,199 / AED 2,699 for the 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage version. If you want the slightly more powerful 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, at this point, it seems like it’s only available on the US Samsung online store, and you’ll pay $849 (prices aren’t available outside the US) for it. It’s unclear if this means the higher-priced model isn’t available in other regions. DesignSamsung Galaxy S10e specsWeight: 150gDimensions: 142.2 x 69.9 x 7.9mmOS: Android 9Screen size: 5.8-inchResolution: 1080 x 2280CPU: Octa-core chipsetRAM: 6/8GBStorage: 128/256GBBattery: 3,100mAhRear camera: 16MP + 12MPFront camera: 10MPAs previously stated, one of the Galaxy S10e’s more attractive features might, ironically, be its smaller size. As main flagships get ever-larger, a contingent of consumers have steadily gone for smaller phones – just look at the popularity of the iPhone SE (RIP) - and the S10e is as manageable as top-tier phones get with a width of 2.75 inches. (Curiously, the iPhone XS is the smallest of its generation, and the S10e is smaller than that phone by a hair.)The S10e otherwise looks like a shrunken version of its pricier siblings, with a few exceptions. Samsung didn’t include the Galaxy line’s Infinity Edge tapered display in this less expensive model, so you’ll have to accept a flat front screen with more noticeable bezels. As it’s the smallest of the S10 line, the S10e is also the lightest, coming in at 150g - which is another feather in its cap when compared to the 208g iPhone XR.Image Credit: TechRadar(Image: © TechRadar)While the S10e doesn’t have its pricier siblings’ fancy in-screen fingerprint scanner, Samsung didn’t leave a biometric fingerprint pad on the back, opting instead to put a small capacitive sensor within an enlarged power button on the top-right side. It’s surprisingly responsive, though it works far better with thumbs. Why? Because you have to cover the whole sensor with your digit, and mashing your fingertip flat enough to envelop the button is tough from any angle. Just use a thumb.Otherwise, the phone looks flagship, with a chromed aluminum case sandwiched by attractive glass and the elegant rounded corners we’ve come to love in the Galaxy S line. The rear has a narrower camera bump than its pricier siblings due to the lack of a third camera and the absence of a heartbeat sensor (which might be an admission that folks weren’t using it much anyway). Image Credit: TechRadar(Image: © TechRadar)The phone officially comes in six colors, though only four are available in the US: Prism Black, The pearlescent Prism White, shimmering Prism Blue, and the new punchy pastel Flamingo Pink. Sadly, Prism Green and Canary Yellow are restricted to other regions.The S10e’s left edge has the volume rocker, which is responsive and functional. Below it sits the much-disliked Bixby button, but fear not: Samsung has gamely allowed you to finally use it to activate other apps. There is a caveat: the button functionality has been split into single and double presses, and one of those must activate Bixby.Image Credit: TechRadar(Image: © TechRadar)Luckily, it’s easy to cordons Bixby to double-press and set single-press to whatever your heart desires. Considering how much Samsung has fought to keep third-party apps from remapping Bixby out of the picture, we’ll take this compromise.On the bottom edge, you’ll find a center-mounted USB-C port, microphone port, speaker grille and...a 3.5mm headphone jack. Samsung has kept its trash-talking high ground.DisplayThe 5.8-inch AMOLED display lives up to the Galaxy S name, with bright colors and crisp detail. If you don’t quite like the color balance, you can tinker with an easy fix called Vivid Mode, which does what it says on the box and lets you further tweak it to be a warmer (more red) or cooler (more blue) picture. If even that isn’t enough, you can tinker with the RGB levels individually.Side-by-side with an iPhone XS Max, the S10e’s screen kept up gamely, losing out only on the darkest scenes in a media comparison (the ‘Blackwater’ episode of Game of Thrones is good fodder for this. Just saying), where backgrounds of varying blacks average out into dark gray smudges.Image Credit: TechRadar(Image: © TechRadar)This is somewhat expected, as the S10e has a single 2280 x 1080 (438 ppi) resolution setting. Samsung sets this as the default for its flagship phones, but both the S10 and S10 Plus max out at 3040 x 1440 for a higher ~550 ppi. One other minor difference between the models: the S10e has Corning Gorilla Glass 5 on front and back, while its bigger siblings have had their front display’s glass upgraded to Gorilla 6.What the whole S10 line has in common, however, is the punch-hole in the top-right corner of the screen, the source of the Samsung-termed ‘Infinity-O’ display. It’s noticeable, like the notches before it, though far less an eyesore than the wider camera tabs found in the likes of the iPhone XS and XS Max. In some ways, dropping the hole within the display looks more attractive than tucking it into a corner, as the eye naturally gravitates toward the uninterrupted borders of the lit screen rather than the circular cutout. But it also feels like Samsung’s flexing its design and manufacturing chops here rather than offering a dynamic solution to the front-facing camera issue. Whether you like it or not will probably come down to personal taste – we like it, but wouldn’t hold it against you to dismiss the punch-hole as a stopgap stunt.In any case, most media apps will automatically black-bar the top and bottom of the display to fit their aspect ratio, which envelops the punch-hole. Don’t worry about it getting in the way of your binge sessions.",Samsung Galaxy S10e review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s10e,"David Lumb, "

It's still one of the most capable Android phones out there. Here are our updated impressions.The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus, even in 2019, lives up to 'the next big thing' slogan we so often hear from Samsung. It has a ridiculously sized screen, fast chipsets and an equally outsized price – though one that has fallen a fair bit since launch.We're seeing more Galaxy S8 Plus deals now that the Galaxy S9 Plus has been out for nearly a year and the Galaxy S10 Plus is due to launch on February 20. The latest model will have a bigger screen and be even more expensive, making this the ideal time to upgrade to 2017's Plus-sized phone.Just how big is the S8 Plus? You’re looking at a 6.2-inch display that far and away makes it one of the best big Android phone you can buy – if you can handle it. The ‘smaller’ 5.8-inch Galaxy S8 or Galaxy S9 exists if you can’t, or if you want something even bigger with a handy stylus, there's the Galaxy Note 8 or Galaxy Note 9.What’s remarkable is that the elegantly curved screen has dramatically grown half an inch from the 5.7-inch Galaxy S7 Edge, yet the phone is nearly the same size. It’s just a bit taller thanks to the elimination of needless bezel and Samsung’s familiar oval-shaped home button. Your big new phone laughs at these water droplets!Moreover, owning this new Android means you’re upgrading to the most cutting-edge, VR-ready smartphone available. Having the absolute best camera and best OLED display matter to you.It’s a glimpse of the future and, in a twist of fate for Samsung vs Apple, a lot of what Apple finally put out through the iPhone X. In 2017, Samsung continued to be the smartphone trendsetter.Obviously, the Galaxy S8 Plus isn’t the perfect phone for everyone, and for more reasons than ‘it’s too tall for people with small hands.’ Having no physical home button is going to be a deal-breaker for some Samsung fans and their muscle memory.Our reaction to trying to find the rear fingerprint sensorIronically for such a futuristic phone, the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor on the S8 Plus is stuck in the past. Accessing this off-center scanner is impractical, and Samsung’s new face-recognition unlock feature just doesn’t work well.Check out our Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus review videoSamsung Galaxy S8 Plus price and release date$35 a month on-contract in the US, $825 unlockedDown to around £599 in the UK and AU$1,349 in AustraliaBundled accessories are still available in some instancesThere are now lots of Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus deals since the phone has been out since May 2017. It's still incredibly expensive but the introduction of the Galaxy Note 8 and the passage of time has meant the price has dropped down a touch.It's cheaper on some carriers than others, but not by muchIn the US it’s now available at about $35 a month with a 24-month contract through carriers. Verizon, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile are all selling the new phone on-contract. It launched on Friday, April 21 2017.Looking for that elusive unlocked Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus in the US? It costs around $460 on Amazon if you get the 'International' version, and $689 via Samsung, and $639 at Best Buy.The SIM-free Samsung Galaxy S8 UK price was £779.99 at launch but it's now down to around £600 from some retailers. Either that or you can get it on-contract through a carrier for £45-£50 a month with £0 cost upfront. In Australia it tops out at AU$1,349. It launched on April 28 2017 in both regions.Design‘Infinity Display’ maximizes the nearly bezel-less screenIts dimensions remain relatively reasonable for a big phoneDust and water-resistant with a stellar IP68 ratingThe Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus design is exactly what we’ve wanted for several years – almost. Before 2017, we had been asking for a bigger screen, but on a phone that’s still small enough to be easy to hold.Its 6.2-inch display doesn't make the actual phone much bigger than beforeSamsung nailed that balance with its nearly bezel-less front face. It once again eliminates the left and right borders with a gently curved screen, and now nearly erases the top and bottom bezels too.It’s a neat trick. You’re getting an 'all-screen' phone – or what Samsung calls its ‘Infinity Display’ – that gives you more screen real estate without significantly increasing the size of the device.It measures 159.5 x 73.4 x 8.1mm and weighs 173g. That’s taller than the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and even the Note 7, but not by much. And get this: the iPhone 7 Plus with its smaller 5.5-inch screen is just a millimeter shorter and actually wider and heavier than the S8 Plus.In fact, it's just about the same size as the S7 Edge (middle) and iPhone 7 Plus (right)Touching the top corners of the display requires two hands, or extreme juggling with one hand. This phone isn’t going to be easy for anyone moving from a 4.7-inch or 5.1-inch screen.Everything about the Galaxy S8 Plus design seems to highlight the real star attraction, the 6.2-inch screen. This includes the rather muted Galaxy S8 colors of Midnight Black, Orchid Gray, and Arctic Silver (we’re not getting Maple Gold or Coral Blue in the West).The same goes for the now-understated rear camera design, and the S-A-M-S-U-N-G logo no longer adorning the top of the screen and staring back at you every single second you use your phone; the logo is now on the back, and everything is a lot cleaner that way.Samsung has eliminated the ugly rear camera bump, and simply outlines the flat lens with a tiny lip. We’re in favor of this decision – a protective camera lip may save your camera if you do happen to drop it and crack the back glass. We’ve found out the hard way that the bump-free, unprotected Google Pixel XL will spiderweb when just about any part of the back glass shatters, rendering your main camera useless.You’re once again protected against the elements, too. Samsung’s phone has an IP68 rating to make it dust- and water-resistant. It can survive 1.5m underwater for 30 minutes – you can probably take it deeper, although we don’t suggest testing your luck or your warranty.The bottom frame of the phone has something new, something old and something ancient: Samsung has finally switched over to the fully reversible USB-C port for charging and data transfer, replacing the non-reversible micro USB port. You can now plug in your phone in the dark. Samsung keeps the old-fashioned 3.5mm headphone jack, dismissing early rumors that its new phone would eliminate this still-widely-used port in favor of USB-C audio. The company even includes high-end AKG-branded earbuds in the box for clearer audio.What’s ancient is the single speaker at the bottom, and we’re disappointed to see it. It’s easy to accidentally cover up the grille when watching YouTube videos in landscape mode, and really, when Apple is beating you to something with the iPhone 7, you know there’s a problem.About that fingerprint scannerFingerprint sensor is awkwardly in the back now, and off-centerIt’s right next to the camera lens, so expect a lot of smudgesFace unlock is wildly inaccurate, while the iris scanner is okayThe biggest shift for long-time Samsung users is the home button. Gone is the physical oval-shaped button, along with the capacitive ‘recent’ and ‘back’ keys that flanked it. Samsung has finally switched to on-screen bottom buttons, including a pressure-sensitive home button.Sure, on-screen buttons aren’t a big deal for non-Samsung Android owners. They’ve been used on LG, Google and Motorola phones for years, just to name a few. And now you can swap the ‘back’ and ‘recent’ keys if you’d like. You’ll get used to their disappearing and reappearing act when watching a movie that takes up the entire screen.However, Samsung fans – and everyone else, really – will be tripped up when it comes to the oddly-placed fingerprint sensor. It’s now on the back of the phone, and in an off-center location next to the camera lens. It’s hard to reach, and you’ll often mistake the camera lens for the sensor. Smudge, smudge, smudge. “Why are my pictures so blurry?”The biggest mistake Samsung has made here is placing this scanner to the right of the camera lens, meaning the majority right-handed users who hold their phone in their non-dominant left hand (to do other things like open doors and of course not drive) are going to have an extra-difficult time unlocking their phone.Samsung’s solution seems to be no shortage of other ways to unlock your phone: passwords, pins, patterns, an iris scanner and the all-new face unlock. Sounds promising, right?Face unlock is the default method that you’ll see on the set-up screen, but, while it may work at first, it rejected our faces more than half of the time, requiring us to enter our backup pattern. A 50% fail rate is incredibly problematic. Don’t worry about someone breaking into your phone – you can’t even get in.Don’t worry about someone breaking into your phone – you can’t even get in.We found that the iris scanner, borrowed from the Note 7, is more accurate and maybe only half a beat behind a normal fingerprint sensor. It doesn’t work with sunglasses, and you have hold the top of phone so it’s aligned with your eyes, but this is the retina-scanning unlock method you should switch to. It’s quick enough, it works in the dark and there are fun cartoon owl eyes and scuba masks, so that the two eyes staring back at you don’t look as demonic as they did on the Note 7. But all of this is a problem when even incredibly cheap Android phones are debuting with fingerprint sensors that work close to 100% of the time. There’s no easy-to-reach fingerprint sensor here, and Samsung’s trumpeted new method, Face unlock, doesn’t even work in the dark.A true fix may come with the Samsung Galaxy S9. The company was reportedly close to being able to embed a fingerprint scanner inside the front home button, but backed off at the last minute. For now, though, it’s this issue that keeps the Galaxy S8 Plus from scoring a five-star review.Display6.2-inch screen with a new 18.5:9 aspect ratio and HDRBest-looking phone screen ever, even if mobile HDR video isn’t here yetImmersive AMOLED display maxes out at Quad HD and defaults to 1080pThe Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus has the world’s best phone display, and for more reasons than simply because it packs in a lot of extra pixels. That’s definitely not all that’s happening here.Its new 18.5:9 aspect ratio elongates the screen’s dimensions to give you more viewing space; you can train your eyes on two to three Facebook stories at a time in your newsfeed, instead of having to continuously scroll just to read portions of one.It’s all thanks to the impressive 88% screen-to-body ratio of Samsung’s ‘Infinity Screen’. The Galaxy S7 Edge had what we thought was a good 76% ratio, while the iPhone 7 Plus sits at about a 68% screen-body ratio.Reading is certainly easier, and split-screen multitasking feels less cramped, but because it deviates from the traditional 16:9 aspect ratio, the phone throws up black bars when playing video content. This didn’t bother us as much as we thought it would, and it’s partly because every S8 color option has a black front face. It blends really well.Samsung also gives you some familiar options you’ll remember from when HD first came onto the scene in an SD world. You can choose Smart Cropping, which fills the entire extra-wide screen (some content is cut off at the top and bottom), or Fit to Screen with black bars.Transitioning between Smart Crop and Fit to Screen is tedious – apps don’t remember what we prefer, and we’re still unsure too. Neither is perfect, though neither is a deal-breaker when it comes to becoming immersed in video on this gorgeous 6.2-inch screen. It’ll be interesting to see where Samsung and LG go with this wider format when they also own the 4K TV market.Samsung is once again pushing HDR on a mobile device, offering more vibrance, brightness and contrast, just like it did on the Note 7 and the Galaxy Tab S3. It’s even touting the Mobile HDR Premium label on the S8 and S8 Plus. Here’s the (literally) unseen problem: HDR video content from Amazon, Netflix and others just isn’t here yet on mobile devices, only your 4K TV.The Galaxy S8 Plus is at least future-proofed for the HDR revolution. It’s not, however, bringing a 4K revolution to the palm of your hand. It sticks with the same Quad HD resolution as the Galaxy S7/Galaxy S7 Edge, and frankly we’re okay with that. We’re even okay with it defaulting to Full HD 1080p as a battery-saving tactic. Quad HD is best saved for VR, when the screen is two inches from your face and even at that 2K-level resolution you’re sometime able to make out individual pixels (what’s called the screen door effect).We’re hoping that Samsung, solely for the purposes of VR, amps that up to 4K with the Galaxy S9 later this year. For everyday use, Full HD actually looks good, and most people won’t be able to tell the difference. You could even tell them it’s 4K and they’ll readily believe you.Samsung’s curved Super AMOLED display makes it seem as if your app tiles and menus are falling off the sides of the screen as you scroll through your many app-filled homepages. It’s a neat effect that’s sure to attraction attention, and we're even happier with the gentler curve here – we’ve experienced fewer false touches than we did with the S7 Edge or any Samsung phone,. so if that’s been a problem for you with past device, consider it fixed.We’re also mightily impressed with the enhanced Always-on Display. It constantly shows the time, date, battery life and tiny notification icons (which you can double-tap to open straight away – after you figure out how to unlock your phone). There’s even a way to display world clocks, a calendar and a small image on the Always-on Display. That’s right, you can set lock screen, home screen and now always-on screen wallpaper.",Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-review,Matt Swider

It blends really well.Samsung also gives you some familiar options you’ll remember from when HD first came onto the scene in an SD world. You can choose Smart Cropping, which fills the entire extra-wide screen (some content is cut off at the top and bottom), or Fit to Screen with black bars.Transitioning between Smart Crop and Fit to Screen is tedious – apps don’t remember what we prefer, and we’re still unsure too. Neither is perfect, though neither is a deal-breaker when it comes to becoming immersed in video on this gorgeous 6.2-inch screen. It’ll be interesting to see where Samsung and LG go with this wider format when they also own the 4K TV market.Samsung is once again pushing HDR on a mobile device, offering more vibrance, brightness and contrast, just like it did on the Note 7 and the Galaxy Tab S3. It’s even touting the Mobile HDR Premium label on the S8 and S8 Plus. Here’s the (literally) unseen problem: HDR video content from Amazon, Netflix and others just isn’t here yet on mobile devices, only your 4K TV.The Galaxy S8 Plus is at least future-proofed for the HDR revolution. It’s not, however, bringing a 4K revolution to the palm of your hand. It sticks with the same Quad HD resolution as the Galaxy S7/Galaxy S7 Edge, and frankly we’re okay with that. We’re even okay with it defaulting to Full HD 1080p as a battery-saving tactic. Quad HD is best saved for VR, when the screen is two inches from your face and even at that 2K-level resolution you’re sometime able to make out individual pixels (what’s called the screen door effect).We’re hoping that Samsung, solely for the purposes of VR, amps that up to 4K with the Galaxy S9 later this year. For everyday use, Full HD actually looks good, and most people won’t be able to tell the difference. You could even tell them it’s 4K and they’ll readily believe you.Samsung’s curved Super AMOLED display makes it seem as if your app tiles and menus are falling off the sides of the screen as you scroll through your many app-filled homepages. It’s a neat effect that’s sure to attraction attention, and we're even happier with the gentler curve here – we’ve experienced fewer false touches than we did with the S7 Edge or any Samsung phone,. so if that’s been a problem for you with past device, consider it fixed.We’re also mightily impressed with the enhanced Always-on Display. It constantly shows the time, date, battery life and tiny notification icons (which you can double-tap to open straight away – after you figure out how to unlock your phone). There’s even a way to display world clocks, a calendar and a small image on the Always-on Display. That’s right, you can set lock screen, home screen and now always-on screen wallpaper.",Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-review,Matt Swider

It's a phone that leads the charge where the Galaxy S8, one of the best phones we've ever tested, left off - but it's not as much of an upgrade, even though it makes our list of the best camera phones.Well, that's at first glance, because there is a raft of updates that some looking to buy the Galaxy S9 will find appealing. Yes, the design is identical to the Galaxy S8, and in reality this really should have been the 'S' variant of that model if Samsung ever wanted to ape Apple's naming strategy.But there's a new, high-power camera on the back that brings genuine innovation in the dual-aperture shutter, as well as a more robust frame and so, so much more power under the hood.The screen is brighter and the dual speakers make this more of a media marvel - and the Galaxy S9 fixes one major flaw with the S8 by making it easy to unlock the phone with your face or finger, which 2017's model failed at - and that's why we've named it as one of our best smartphones around at the moment.If this sounds like we're talking up an uninspiring phone, that's partly true - but we wanted to make sure you knew the big changes on the S9 if you were confused on why it looks so similar to last year's model.Image Credit: TechRadarThese plus points are also set against a backdrop of a high price; we’re not talking iPhone XS levels here, but it’s still one of the more expensive options you can buy. The larger Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus with a 6.2-inch screen is even pricier.It's also worth noting that the Samsung Galaxy S9 will soon be replaced at the top of the firm's flagship tree by the Galaxy S10, which will launch on February 20.If you're considering buying the Galaxy S9 we'd recommend holding off until then.

The Galaxy S9 price at launch was £739, $719.99, or AU$1,199 SIM-free directly from Samsung, but it's much cheaper now.In the UK, the original price was a huge price jump over the previous year's handset, which started at £689. However, the price has now dropped, and if you shop around you can find the Galaxy S9 for around £475 in the UK (you can check out the latest and greatest Galaxy S9 deals here) and for around $600 in the US depending on where you shop, making it a much more attractive proposition.There aren’t any storage variants of this phone though in the UK or US, with only the 64GB option on sale, but in some markets the Galaxy S9 is available in 128GB and 256GB builds.AR EmojiToo much of a noveltyNeeds a more powerful facial recognitionImage Credit: TechRadarIt took us a little while to come around to the idea of AR Emoji... and then not too long to get bored by them again.Let's be honest here: these are a clear response to Apple's Animoji, which gained a lot of attention when the iPhone X launched, and which make use of the TrueDepth camera on the front of the iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and iPhone XR, and the iOS 12 update has a similar Memoji trick.Samsung's offering feels like a watered-down version of this, albeit one with a bit more personality. To create your own little avatar you simply smile into the front-facing camera, and the Galaxy S9 creates your own digital version of you.Once it’s created, you can change your avi’s hair and skin color and choose an outfit – it's a shame there aren't more customization options here, as the outfits are a bit limited and the hair colors aren’t particularly nuanced. This may seem like a tiny thing, but if you can't make your AR Emoji look like you then you – and your friends – are going to struggle to engage with it.The GIF emoji are fun, but get tired quicklyIn our testing we found that we needed to create our avatar a few times, as there were occasional glitches like a weird face shape or the wrong-colored eyes. We also had to get used to the fact that it doesn't look like us all the time, although in some of the instantly-generated GIFs you can use for social media we suddenly saw that our AR Emoji mimicked some of our features well from different angles.Those GIFs are probably the best thing about this new feature – and they get tiresome relatively quickly. You send a few to friends on compatible apps (the AR Emoji GIFs are baked into the Galaxy S9's keyboard, but you can't add them in Twitter or Gmail, only in apps like WhatsApp at the moment), but the novelty wears off pretty quickly.The other thing you can do is record a video of yourself speaking as the AR Emoji... and this is where things start to unravel. The Galaxy S9 picks up most of your features, but also gives your avatar a little flickering mouth or eye at times when the camera loses you.It shows that, to make this feature work properly, brands need a more powerful camera, rather than just relying on software and the front-facing option.AR Emoji are fun for a little while, but on their own they're certainly not a reason to buy this phone.Bixby is back... and betterBixby Voice is still behindBixby Vision is far more usefulBixby Vision returns more results... but some are not as accurate as others.We were thoroughly disappointed by Bixby on the Galaxy S8 last year, as it promised to be the ultimate digital assistant and, well, it wasn't.It simply couldn't do enough – it wasn’t able to work out what you wanted contextually, and it wasn’t able to start or control enough apps. We could forgive the gestation period for this feature if it wasn't for the fact that Google Assistant is already on the phone, and incredibly capable.However, Samsung has upgraded Bixby on the Galaxy S9, and kept the Bixby button on the side of the device to allow you to interact with your assistant. You use the button as on a walkie-talkie, pressing to talk to Bixby and releasing when you’ve delivered your command… but it's a bit slow to catch up.Bixby can be too literal – wanting to set a timer preset rather than just starting a countdown for example – and while you can ask it to take a picture and send it to a friend the whole process takes around 30 seconds – and that's assuming Bixby can find the friend to start with – in which time you’d rather just do it manually.The Galaxy S9 also keeps telling us that we can dictate using Bixby, but this was never 100% accurate – it was pretty darn good, considering that you're essentially talking to a baby robot, but we needed to edit our words before sending.Bixby Vision has come a long way though – and the fact that it's turned off by default is just beautiful. No longer do the little green fireflies automatically dance across your viewfinder when you're trying to take a picture of your car, dog, mother or laundry basket (to show her you've done it all) as the phone tries to work out what's being looked at.Bixby is becoming more capable, getting closer to the abilities of Siri but not at Google Assistant level yet. Image Credit: TechRadarHowever, when you do turn on Vision the features are pretty useful. Bixby is much, much better at being able to work out what it's seeing than what it’s hearing, and can give accurate results on the web for things like comics, lamps and nature scenes. The translation tool is also very strong – it comes up with some weird answers here and there, but on the whole it's very easy to work out what you're looking at. Samsung is making a big deal about this feature, although in reality it's a bit niche... you'll need to be in a foreign country, with data, and completely unable to work out what you're looking at.So while it's good that Bixby has been upgraded, to at least bring some sense to having that button on the side of the phone, it's still a novelty rather than a must-have feature. Mapping the button to Google Assistant is still a far better way to get the most from your phone with your voice (although you’ll need to download a third party app to do it), despite it being more limited in scope... at least it manages the things it can do very well.It's a shame Samsung doesn't offer the option to switch the button to Google Assistant, as we enjoyed the Assistant button on the LG G7 ThinQ.Improved biometricsIntelligent scan is accurate, but not as secureFar easier to unlock your phoneThe new Intelligent Scan cycles between facial recognition and iris scanning. Image Credit: TechRadarAnyone who read our Galaxy S8 review last year would have realised quite quickly that the biometric unlocking features of that phone almost made it unusable. The fingerprint scanner was too hard to reach, the iris scanner too unreliable and the facial recognition just too poor.Samsung needed to do something, and it has, with all three features now working seamlessly and interchangeably. Intelligent Scan marries the iris scanner and facial recognition to make unlocking your phone with your face a far, far simpler task, and as mentioned the fingerprint scanner is much easier to hit.The speed of the Intelligent Scan feature is so much better than last year... where the iris scanner and facial recognition on the S8 were between 30% and 50% accurate, the two together on the Galaxy S9 yield success almost every time.In low light the iris scanner is still a bit slow to react, and not always pleased to let you in (in this case, Apple's Face ID absolutely destroys it for accuracy and ease of use), but it's so simple to just flick your finger to the scanner on the back that we never had an issue.That's a real benefit over the iPhone X and XS, keeping the fingerprint scanner.The fingerprint scanner is now below the camera and in a far easier spot to hit. Image Credit: TechRadar There are a couple of flaws with the biometric system. First, the 2D scan of the face the S9 makes to recognize you isn't as secure as other methods, like the fingerprint scanner or Apple's Face ID.That's not a huge problem for us – the fingerprint scanner is a better way of paying for things anyway, and really biometric unlocking is more about convenience than it is security. We weren't able to dupe the Samsung Galaxy S9 with a picture of our face, so if you lose your phone you can feel secure in the knowledge that the thief isn't getting in, which is what most of us really want.Second, and more frustratingly, you can’t really unlock the phone when it’s placed on a table – the field of vision for the scanner is limited, so unless you weirdly shove your head over it you won’t get in, whereas Apple’s Face ID offers a much wider viewing angle.New speakersAKG tuned sound is loudA tiny bit lacking in punch, but a big upgrade on the S8The speakers still fire downward from the bottom of the phone, but also from the earpiece. Image Credit: TechRadar The other key feature that Samsung is talking up on the Galaxy S9 is the improved speaker setup. If you're tired of hearing sound shoot out the bottom of your phone, you'll appreciate that the top earpiece is now able to fire out sound towards your face. These speakers have also been tuned to support Dolby Atmos sound, giving you a sense of space from the audio coming out from your phone.Given how thin this phone is, the overall volume and quality of sound coming out of it is impressive. If anything the volume can go a little too high, and we found ourselves turning it down on occasion, despite only watching videos on social media.The quality isn't the best on the market – there's definitely a little more punch and clarity from the iPhone X, where the Galaxy S9 is a little bit muddier – but the idea here isn't to replace a Bluetooth speaker, but rather provide a decent experience when listening to music or podcasts without earphones.",Samsung Galaxy S9review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-review,Gareth Beavis

69,,2018-06-20T14:50:00.17Z,n2wdCxeke3yBbHKcnwc8nd,"You may not have heard of Vivo before, but the Chinese company has just announced one of the most exciting phones we've seen, in the form of the Vivo Nex.The flagship device from Vivo comes packed with a variety of next generation features that have allowed Vivo to get as close to a bezel-less phone as we’ve seen before.It has an in-display fingerprint scanner (which Vivo claims is more accurate than ever) as well as a pop-up selfie camera and a few other tweaks, alongside some top of the range internal tech to make this one of the most exciting devices we’ve seen launch in 2018.Update: There are actually three variants of the handset Vivo is calling ""Nex"". The one we've been hands on with is the top-of-the-line Vivo Nex S, which boasts a Snapdragon 845 chipset, 8GB of RAM, an in-display fingerprint scanner and 256GB of storage.There is a second variant of the Nex S, with the only difference being 128GB of storage. Finally, there's the Vivo Nex A, which has a lesser Snapdragon 770 chipset, 6GB of RAM and a rear fingerprint scanner rather than one built into the screen.5 things we've learned from using the Vivo Nex for 24 hoursVivo Nex price and release date The bad news to start - this phone is currently only set to launch in China. It may in the future come to other markets around the world, but right now Vivo is only confirming a Chinese release for the Vivo Nex where it is out now.The price is set at 4998 yuan (about $780, £600, AU$1050) for the 256GB version, while the 128GB version costs 4498 yuan (about $700, £530, AU$950). Vivo may change the price if it comes to other markets around the world though.Design and display The last 12 months in phone design have been about slimming down the bezels further than ever, opting for 18:9 aspect ratio displays and including a notch at the top of the screen to hide away the important tech, but Vivo hasn’t done that.You have to applaud Vivo for not following the crowd and including a notch on its 'bezel-less' phone, as instead it’s opted for a variety of new technology to achieve an incredible 91.24% screen-to-body ratio.So, that’s not totally bezel-free like some marketing would have you believe about this phone. There’s a very slim chin at the bottom of the phone as well as a faint bezel around the outside, but it’s still remarkable how little bezel there is.To be able to make that happen, Vivo has used three different technologies. The first is a pop-up selfie camera that is in the top left edge of the phone. Once you boot up the selfie mode, you’ll be greeted by the little camera mechanically jumping up so you can take your shot.If you then exit the camera app or switch back to the main camera, it will drop back down in about 2 seconds. It’s a novelty to play around with the little camera at the moment, watching it jump up.Image 1 of 2Image 2 of 2We were a little worried it would take too long to start up for when you want to take a quick selfie, but once you’ve switched the camera to selfie mode it takes less than 2 seconds and so far we haven’t found ourselves frustrated with that speed.Because of the selfie camera hiding inside the phone, there's no face scanner on the Vivo Nex like we've seen on a lot of modern flagship phones announced in 2018.Can't stop playing the sound effect on the Vivo Nex selfie camera... such a simple thing #VivoNEX pic.twitter.com/JAc2dfutXQJune 14, 2018Next to the selfie camera there's a 3.5mm headphone jack, while the bottom edge of the phone features the USB-C charging port and a single speaker for listening to general audio.The second innovation involves the earpiece speaker, which you use to hear the other end of the line in a phone conversation. Where other smartphones have a hole for this in the body of the phone, Vivo has instead built the earpiece into the display itself.This is achieved using a technology called Screen SoundCasting and it works in a similar way to bone conduction technology. It means you can place any part of the screen to your ear during a phone call, and Vivo claims this should offer better sound quality in phone calls too.Whether that will improve the quality of phone calls in loud environments or other areas remains to be seen, but we’ll be sure to test this further in the future.The third technology is including an in-display fingerprint sensor. This isn’t the first phone we’ve seen come to market with in-display security tech, but it’s still a novelty to just place your finger on the screen and watch it work its authentication magic.For the Vivo Nex, you can only place your finger or thumb in a specific area on the screen. There’s a little icon to show you where to place it, and so far in our very limited testing we’ve found it to work speedily. We'll need to test it further to see just how accurate it is, but Vivo recommends it as the primary way to unlock the phone.Including those three technologies has allowed the company to rid the front of the phone of the notch or a large chin at the bottom, and while this doesn’t have quite such a high screen-to-body ratio as the Vivo concept phone we saw at MWC 2018, it’s still stunning when you first power the screen on.The display itself is only Full HD+, which when you study the pixels when watching video is noticeable, but it’s an AMOLED display so the colors are vibrant.The design of the phone includes a glass back with curved edges, which means it sits quite comfortably in the hand. We don't currently know if it has Gorilla Glass protection or not. This is a large phone, but considering it has an almost 6.6-inch display it’s very easy to hold in one hand.At a weight of 199g it’s not the lightest device on the market, but considering its size this will be about the weight you’d expect from a phone like this. It's also worth noting the phone isn't waterproof or dustproof, so you won't want to drop this in a sink full of water.Specs and features Inside the Vivo Nex there's a top-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chipset, which is the same as we’ve seen in a number of flagship devices this year and we hope to see it perform well in this Vivo device too.It should do, as it’s paired with 8GB of RAM. In our couple of hours of testing, apps loaded quickly and moving around throughout the UI was snappy, so we have high hopes for what the phone will be able to achieve.Storage-wise you may be disappointed to hear there’s no microSD card slot, but instead the company has included 256GB of storage on the phone as the standard amount, so most buyers should have more than enough space.The phone we've tested is running a specific OS for the Chinese market, which means it currently doesn't have access to a lot of Android specific services like the Google Play Store. If it does come out in other countries, we'd expect Vivo to rework the operating system on the phone for that release.Battery and camera Vivo has opted for a 4,000mAh cell inside the Nex, which is large but may still struggle considering how much screen this phone has to be powering whenever it’s turned on. We’ll be sure to test its life at a later date.Despite the glass back, Vivo hasn’t included wireless charging technology in this phone, but it does at least support fast charging.When it comes to cameras, we’ve already spoken about the innovative selfie idea where it comes up from inside the phone. The quality of selfies has been okay in our testing, with it being an 8MP sensor with an aperture of f/2.0.This won’t give you those stunning selfie shots that you can see from some phones, but the novelty alone of it coming up from inside the Vivo Nex is sure to encourage you to boot up the front camera more often.On the back of the device there's a dual-lens camera that uses one 12MP lens and another 5MP one. The 12MP lens has an aperture of f/1.8, while the 5MP sensor is f/2.4. So far Vivo hasn’t shared details on what each of the sensors does, so we’ll update this review with more once we know.There are camera AI features here like on the Huawei range of products and some other devices, meaning the camera will optimize its settings to take what it believes to be the best shot when you’re shooting particular objects.Vivo has packed in loads of other features here too including a beauty mode, panoramas and artificial intelligence filters that will work in a similar way to Snapchat.Early verdictThe Vivo Nex is unmistakably an exciting phone that comes packed with innovative features and gives an alternative to the notch design for those who are desperate to own a bezel-less phone.These new technologies may be embraced over the next few years by companies around the world, and we just hope the Vivo Nex is deemed big enough to be available all around the world as soon as possible.5 things we've learned from using the Vivo Nex for 24 hours",Hands on: Vivo Nex review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/vivo-nex,James Peckham
70,,2018-04-13T08:45:36.102Z,2gCA3jK3cdYpCarUcvSKAT,"Every brand, at one point or another, has borrowed something from the Apple design portfolio but no other brand imitates the American tech company like Vivo. It’s all the more apparent with the Vivo V9, which features the iPhone X-type notch, vertical dual camera and an identical settings menu. Like the Oppo F-series, the Vivo V9 also boasts of a camera that will give you incredible shots. Meanwhile, the Oppo F7 undercuts the Vivo V9 price of Rs 22,990 by Rs 1,000. The smartphone looks interesting enough but it remains to be seen whether or not it can prove itself to be worth the price tag.Price and availabilityThe Vivo V9 costs Rs 22,990 and there’s only the one version of the phone with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. It’s been available on Flipkart and Amazon since April 2. You have the choice between Champagne Gold, Pearl Black And Sapphire Blue.Design and displayVivo V9 displayLet’s start with the notch on the Vivo V9. The whole point of employing the notch design on a smartphone is that users have more screen space allowing for better immersion. Ideally the phone should support a 19:9 aspect ratio but instead it runs apps at 18:9 or 16:9, depending on what the app itself supports.Vivo V9 SpecificationsDimensions:  154.8 x 75.1 x 7.9 mmOS: Android 8.1 (Oreo)Screen size: 6.3 inches Resolution: 1080 x 2280 pixelsCPU: Snapdragon 626RAM: 4GB Storage: 64GB Battery: 3,260mAh Rear camera: 16MP + 5MP Front camera: 24MP The area to the left of the notch shows the time, network connectivity and notification icons while the area on the right has the battery, alarm, and net connectivity icons. The Oppo F7, on the other hand, allows compatible apps to run at a 19:9 aspect ratio but can even force apps that only support 16:9 or 18:9 to function within the 19:9 format. Vivo V9’s notch includes a notification LED light which adds a level of convenience to the phone. The only real use of the top, since it allows the display to be on either side is so that the company can claim that the screen measures 6.3-inches. That being said, the phone isn’t compact or ergonomic but doesn’t feel bulky either thanks to its curved edges. Even the build of the phone isn’t too impressive. It has a plastic body, with coating on the rear to give the impression of a glass back. It catches way too many fingerprints consistently and you immediately reach for the phone cover that comes in the box so that it stops happening. Since it’s made out of the plastic, the phone’s relatively light as well. The Pearl Black model that we were privy to, looked like a mid-range phone, which it is. That is to say, there’s nothing so unique about it that it can convince you of being a premium device but it’s not so shoddy that it could be confused for an entry level smartphone.The power and volume buttons are stacked on the right side, with the SIM tray across on the left. The MIcroUSB port along the bottom is a little bit of a let down since USB Type-C is far more efficient and honestly expected in a device that’s in the 20K segment. Along with the charging port, the 3.5mm headphone jack and speakers are along the bottom as well. At the back, the Vivo V9 sports a vertical dual camera setup with a LED flash, and a fingerprint sensor. ",,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/vivo-v9,Prabhjote Gill

Though the names don't match, for me, the phones are identical. The new device is more of a pro variant of the Vivo V9. 'Pro', as I said, would indicate that it is a more 'superior' product than an existing one; in this case, the name is different. However, device-wise, the 'pro' factor holds true. Read more: OnePlus 6T McLaren EditionThe Vivo X21 looks like an ordinary mid-range phone with a decent overall package of features. But it's actually not. It carries a feature which the whole tech industry is currently eyeing. It's the next step towards making the bezel-less phones even more meaningful.It has the in-display fingerprint sensor that Vivo showcased during the MWC on the Apex, the concept phone. The good part is that it actually works. But how well does it work? We'll find out. Vivo X21 price and availabilityThe Vivo X21 has been priced at Rs 35,990 and is available exclusively on Flipkart. Vivo has also announced that the device will come with the company’s XE710 headphone.Design and displayPremium design Fits well in handBig for one handed usageThe Vivo X21, as I've already said, shares its aesthetics with the cheaper sibling Vivo V9. It has the same glass back with slightly curved sides, providing users a good grip.It has a glass and metal design, which surely is solid to hold. It is densely built and the glass feels strong too.Yes, it does look like the Vivo V9, but without a squarish fingerprint sensor on the back. If Vivo would've named it the V9 Pro, that would've made no difference. It's THAT similar.The front is interesting, as it was on the V9. It has a full HD+ display with a 19:9 aspect ratio sporting a notch at the top. It's a very nearly bezel-less display with the thickest bezels on the chin. But that's still thin considering the competition. There's no Vivo branding on the front either. There's a dual rear camera module on the top left. It's quite small compared to the other vertically stacked sensor. There's a sharp, thin rim around the camera, but it's quite subtle and shouldn't get scratched when placed on rough surface. Vivo anyway provides a plastic case to protect the body. Despite being thin, it carries the traditional 3.5mm jack on the top. There's one shortcoming though - the micro USB at the bottom. Still, the 6.3-inch AMOLED display manages to impress with its size and immersive viewing experience. It's a full HD+ panel that sits like a layer on top of the body, and looks even from different angles. It's sharp, colours pop up well, and even sunlight legibility isn't a problem.All-in-all, the overall look and feel of the phone isn't bad for the price. If you look at the OnePlus 6, there's a lot of similarity between the two and even the quality isn't compromised. Software and UIThe Vivo X21 runs Android 8.1 Oreo, but thanks to Vivo's FunTouch OS, it looks nowhere close to stock. There's a thick skin of customised FunTouch OS 4.0, which brings along tons of additional features and bloatware. There's V-Appstore (Vivo's own application store), i Music, i Theme, i Manager, EasyShare, vivo.com app, and some popular apps like Facebook, Amazon, PhonePe and WhatsApp. Unfortunately, Vivo gives you no option to uninstall the resident apps. The ones inspired by the character 'i' in particular. Third party apps like Facebook and WhatsApp can be removed.As always, FunTouch OS draws some 'i'nspiration from the iOS, but it works well. Animations are subtle, transitions are smooth and there are no signs of lag and latency initially. However, the default icon pack isn't that subtle.Enter Settings, and you will see another iOS-like screen with similar icon packs and UI layout. There's a lot to see in the settings, so I just jumped around the few new options I've never seen before.One of such options was the smart motion. It basically lets you customise gestures like - raise to wake, double tap to wake (LG's knock knock), shake to turn the flashlight (Moto's chop-chop), tilt to zoom, air unlock, lock-screen gestures and so on.Furthermore, there's the split-screen, picture in picture, app cloning and more such features. This basically means, there's a lot to explore and use, but it's still has to be seen if those work as well.In-screen fingerprint sensorMy first move was to open security settings, registering my fingerprint as soon as I unboxed the X21. And that's because this is something unique the device has on offer. An in-display or under the display fingerprint sensor is a technology that allows you to scan your fingerprint through the display. A technology that the Samsung Galaxy S9 was expected to come with. However, the X21 is the first phone to have this feature ready to use. The conventional smartphone fingerprint sensor has become faster and more efficient over the years. And that will also be the case with the in-display fingerprint sensor well, but for now, this one of the X21 works. It's not as fast as the normal sensor on the OnePlus 6, but then, it's not as slow as the one on the iPhone 5S. It does take its time to register initially. I had to try thrice on my first attempt to register my fingerprint, but once you get used to the right way to place your finger, it works just fine. While registering, I realised it's easier to move your finger around the sensor when you actually see it; otherwise, you'll fail to 'register' it quite a few times.Once done, it works quite well. It's accurate 8 out of 10 times and it does unlock quickly. However, the animations do add an extra second to the unlock time.CameraSimilar to the Vivo V9 it has a dual camera module with a 12MP primary and 5MP secondary camera with f/1.8 and f/2.4 aperture respectively. It's a downgrade if you consider the megapixel count but it's an upgrade for better low-light photography.During our initial tests, the results were convincing. We tested it in day light and it showed promise. At times, the pictures looked artificially enhanced. We have not gotten a chance to test it in low-light yet, but we'll be updating this review once we're done with that. It uses a monochrome lens to click portrait photos, and allows adjustment of blur to strengthen or lighten the effect. Also, the shutter speed and image processing remains snappy on a new Vivo X21. We'll test it further to see if it slows down overtime.Camera samplesImage 1 of 9Image 2 of 9Image 3 of 9Image 4 of 9Image 5 of 9Image 6 of 9Image 7 of 9Image 8 of 9Image 9 of 9VerdictVivo X21 at Rs 35,990 sits at a position where there are phones like the new OnePlus 6 that are popular and have their own space. The X21 brings a good set of specifications along with a premium look and feel to the table, but there's nothing that feels sufficient to justify the price as of now. The in-display fingerprint sensor is a feature that's new and unique, sure, but is that enough to justify spending this amount of cash on it? Vivo V9 review",Hands on: Vivo X21 review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/vivo-x21-india,Sudhanshu Singh

The Xiaomi Mi A2 is an Android One device that sports stock-like Android software, miles apart from Xiaomi’s usual MiUI implementation, a software the company really banks on to engage its community.When it launched the Mi A1 last year, the company’s tryst with stock Android software was an experiment, but having seen unprecedented success with that device, the phone is now part of Xiaomi’s yearly cycle. Hence, the Mi A2 is an update over its predecessor, and brings a healthy mix of Google and Xiaomi in one phone.Price and availabilityThe Mi A2 launches in Spain immediately, at €249 for the 4GB/32GB variant and €279 for the 4/64GB variant and €349 for the 6/128GB version. The phone lands in India on 8 August, but only the 4/64GB variant is expected to be sold in the country.There’s a Mi A2 Lite as well, which is being sold at €179 for the 3/32GB version and €229 for the 4/64GB variant. While the company has announced this phone already, it’s availability in all of Xiaomi’s markets is yet to be confirmed.What’s newThe primary changes this year include a larger 5.9-inch FHD+ display, a new dual-camera combination on the back and a higher resolution front camera. The Mi A2 omits the telephoto lens from last year, in favour of a 20MP+12MP setup. So, the camera doesn’t have fancy optical zooming capabilities, but it still shoots portrait shots. In fact, Xiaomi says its software will intelligently choose which sensor to use when you’re shooting photos in portrait mode.There’s also a sizeable update in terms of processing power, but perhaps not enough to ditch your Mi A1 just yet. The Snapdragon 660 takes a page out of Qualcomm’s flagship chipset (the 845), replacing ARM’s Cortex A53 cores with custom Kryo 260 cores. That should give a good boost in terms of processing speeds, at least on paper. You can expect higher benchmark scores compared to the Mi A1.Xiaomi is also quite confident about the camera this time and suggests that it will be comparable to the OnePlus 6, which is quite a claim to make. While it’s too early to take a call on this, things are looking up after the first few shots. The camera app here is the only noticeable change to Google’s stock Android software.The Mi A2 still comes with a two-year update promise, meaning it will definitely get the Android P and Android Q updates in future. At the moment, the phone runs Android 8.1 Oreo out of the box.DesignWhile the Xiaomi Mi A2 retains the general look of the Mi A2, there’s a noticeable change in its identity. For one, the phone feels wider, meaning it’s not as ergonomic as its predecessor. The “hand feel” isn’t of a compact phone and lies closer to that of a phablet. It’s also slimmer and has the full metal build like last time.The two cameras are placed vertically on the top left on the back, with a noticeable bulge. You’ll find the fingerprint sensor below it, at the centre of the rear panel.While the design has changed a bit, this looks more old school amongst a sea of notch-riddled, full screen smartphones today. The Mi A2 is not a big screen phone with a small overall footprint. And that might actually work against Xiaomi at this point.Early verdictIn Xiaomi’s core markets, like India and China, the Mi A2 might be the only notch-free device that anyone will care about. The company’s decision to make a stock Android device paid off last time and the phone has entered the yearly grind. The Mi A2 is an update over its predecessor, so it’s not expected to replace your Mi A1. However, it gives Xiaomi a shot at user acquisition, by getting customers who aren’t too fond of the company’s own software. In the long run, the Mi A2 would likely be one of Xiaomi’s many phones only, but it keeps the company relevant and grinding.Particularly in India, the Mi A2 might be very important to Xiaomi’s cause. Since the company will hike the pricing this time, the Mi A2 will be sold at a price tier that Xiaomi has often failed to capture.

You can buy the phone on Amazon India, mi.com and Mi Home.  Xiaomi Redmi 5 is already up for sale in blue, pink, gold, black and a lake blue colour. As a part of an introductory offer, Xiaomi has partnered with Jio for an instant cash back of Rs 2,200 (on the first recharge) along with 100GB of 4G data (on recharges of Rs 198 and Rs 299). Redmi 5 buyers will also get up to 90% discount on first Kindle e-books.The Redmi 5 has a Redmi Note 5-like designDesign and displayMetal unibody feels solid5.7-inch HD+, 18:9 aspect ratio displayThe Redmi 5, like its siblings, has an iterative design that makes it look exactly like a smaller Redmi Note 5. Well, that's not the first time I am saying this for a Redmi phone - the Redmi 4 resembled the Note 4. The Redmi 5 has a good design and build quality for its price, but it doesn’t differentiate it from the design language that’s being followed for the last two years. It's a good thing that the design on the Redmi 5 doesn’t look like a cheaper replica of a popular flagship, but it still fails excite us. It is a solid phone, offers a great in-hand feel and can be used comfortably with just one hand, but it looks dull if you put it next to the Honor 9 Lite.I bring up the Honor 9 Lite because it's a perfect example of great design for its price. I am not saying Xiaomi should come up with a blingy phone, but my intention here is emphasise on the fact that consumers want phones that look different.Despite sharing looks with its predecessor, the phone has some minor alterations. It is taller, wider, heavier and more sleek than the Redmi 4. The back looks a lot like the Redmi Note 5, with the camera housed right above the fingerprint sensor and not placed in the top left corner.The dual grill at the bottom is for the loudspeaker and the primary microphoneFrom the front, the phone looks exactly like the Note 5, which means more screen space and less bezels. This also means that the physical navigation keys have been replaced by the on-screen ones this time. Like previous Redmi phones, it has rounded corners, a flat back with curved sides. However, the curves aren’t as well pronounced as we have seen in the past.The front gets a full score in terms of looks, but Xiaomi should consider bringing in newer elements to the next phone. The display is one of the highlights.We all must thank the Mi Mix for setting an example for the future phones with its bezel-less design. Forget flagships, even entry level phones have minimal bezels and an 18:9 display these days. Exactly a year ago, the Redmi Note 4 was launched with a 5.5-inch display and the Redmi 4 had a smaller one. Thanks to the new display trend, now even the Redmi 5 has a bigger 5.7-inch display than the Note 4.The Redmi 5 does not retain the smaller display size, but it still has a decent HD+ (720p) panel like its predecessor. Colours look vibrant but a slight blue tinge makes its presence felt. Sunlight visibility remains sub-optimal, but auto-brightness makes up for it. Overall, it’s a colourful display with cool tones, a wide colour gamut and decent viewing angles.For games and media consumption, this is one of the best displays found on a phone at this price point.",Xiaomi Redmi 5 review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-5,Sudhanshu Singh

81,,2018-04-02T08:37:21.91Z,7ELCrYeECgkzk7Ly7TvA6g,"Xiaomi, with the launch of Redmi 5, seems to have struck a final nail on the smartphone-price coffin. The company has been dominating the  space for smartphones priced anywhere between Rs 6,000 to Rs 16,000. When the Redmi 5A was launched, it took over the entry-level segment, and within a few months it was followed by the Redmi Note 5 and the Note 5 Pro that knocked out phones priced between 10-15K. We were not quite done talking about the Redmi Note 5, and Xiaomi went ahead and delivered the Redmi 5 to replace the Redmi 4 in the 7-10K price segment. It is the company's solution for users looking for a compact yet balanced handset that also offers logical value proposition.Read more: Xiaomi Mi A2My experience with Redmi was more or less similar to all the other Redmi phones I have used prior to this. The major difference overall here was the size and the battery. I had written about my three days experience with the Redmi 5 earlier, and most of the things I mentioned there remain.Xiaomi has updated the Redmi 5 with some in-trend elements like the 18:9 display and minimal bezels. But the question I had before writing the review were mostly about the new upgrades on the phone. Do these feature make the experience better? Is this a phone I wanted to see after the Redmi 4? And most importantly, is this a phone worth recommending because it's actually good, or just because there is a lack of competition?The answer to all these questions are in the review. Read on. Xiaomi Redmi 5 price and availabilityThe Redmi 5 launch prices start from Rs 7,999Xiaomi Redmi 5 specsWeight: 157gDimensions:  151.8 x 72.8 x 7.7 mmmmOS: MIUI 9.0 (Android 7 Nougat)Screen size: 5.7 inchesResolution: 720 x 1440 (18:9 aspect ratio)CPU: Snapdragon 450RAM: 2GB/3GB/4GBStorage: 16GB/32GBBattery: 3,300mAhRear camera: 12MPFront camera: 5MPThe price starts at Rs 7,999 for the phone with a 2GB RAM and 16GB storage, the 3GB/32GB variant costs Rs 8,999, and you'll be set back by Rs 10,999 for the top-of-the-line 4GB/64GB variant. You can buy the phone on Amazon India, mi.com and Mi Home.  Xiaomi Redmi 5 is already up for sale in blue, pink, gold, black and a lake blue colour. As a part of an introductory offer, Xiaomi has partnered with Jio for an instant cash back of Rs 2,200 (on the first recharge) along with 100GB of 4G data (on recharges of Rs 198 and Rs 299). Redmi 5 buyers will also get up to 90% discount on first Kindle e-books.The Redmi 5 has a Redmi Note 5-like designDesign and displayMetal unibody feels solid5.7-inch HD+, 18:9 aspect ratio displayThe Redmi 5, like its siblings, has an iterative design that makes it look exactly like a smaller Redmi Note 5. Well, that's not the first time I am saying this for a Redmi phone - the Redmi 4 resembled the Note 4. The Redmi 5 has a good design and build quality for its price, but it doesn’t differentiate it from the design language that’s being followed for the last two years. It's a good thing that the design on the Redmi 5 doesn’t look like a cheaper replica of a popular flagship, but it still fails excite us. It is a solid phone, offers a great in-hand feel and can be used comfortably with just one hand, but it looks dull if you put it next to the Honor 9 Lite.I bring up the Honor 9 Lite because it's a perfect example of great design for its price. I am not saying Xiaomi should come up with a blingy phone, but my intention here is emphasise on the fact that consumers want phones that look different.Despite sharing looks with its predecessor, the phone has some minor alterations. It is taller, wider, heavier and more sleek than the Redmi 4.

82,,2017-12-27T13:30:30.36Z,syiLVwGr8MDFXEFauBqira,"Xiaomi, as we all know, is the king in the budget smartphone segment in India right now. Almost every phone from the company has managed to match consumer expectations and impress buyers. The Redmi 4A is a solid example of this, redefining the price to performance ratio in its time. To update this product, Xiaomi unveiled the Redmi 5A in India, pitching it as the ""Desh Ka Smartphone"", which is a minor upgrade over its predecessor. When compared to the 4A, the phones are hardly different. It's similar to the relationship between the OnePlus 5T and OnePlus 5. It's something of a cosmetic update.Read more: Xiaomi Mi 8 ProWhat still keeps the Redmi 5A on top of the competition is its hardware. Xiaomi has announced that the 2GB RAM and 16GB storage variant will be up for grabs at Rs 4,999 for the first 5 million units, thereafter, the price will revert to the original, Rs 5,999. On the other hand, the 3GB RAM and 32GB storage variant will continue to retail at Rs 6,999.So, can the Redmi 5A can be the perfect smartphone for people on a tight budget? Let's find out.Xiaomi Redmi 5A price and release dateOut now in India, available on Mi.com, Flipkart and Mi HomeLaunched in two variants, the 2GB RAM variant costs Rs 5,999 and the 3GB RAM variant for Rs 6,999First five million units to be sold at Rs 4,999The 2GB RAM + 16GB storage variant is priced at INR 4,999 for the first five million units, post which, it will be available for INR 5,999. The 3GB RAM + 32GB storage variant is priced at INR 6,999.The Redmi 5A went on sale at noon on December 7, across Flipkart, Mi.com, and Mi Home stores. As per recent reports, you may soon be able to purchase the 3GB RAM variant of the Redmi 5A from offline retailers by paying a premium of Rs 500, bringing the total price up to Rs 7,499.DesignFeels solid Small form factor aids one handed operation perfectlyCurved and smooth back means it sits comfortably in the hand Perfect for one handed usageThe Redmi 5A features a unibody design with a metallic finish on top of a good quality plastic back. It looks identical to its other Redmi counterparts, and feels like a shrunken Redmi 4. The sides are metallic, which packs it firmly, hence it feels pretty sturdy to hold. It weighs 137 grams and measures 140.4 x 70.1 x 8.4 mm, which makes it a pretty handy device.Navigation keys are not backlitSimilar to the Redmi 4A, it has the front camera, earpiece and ambient light sensor on the top of the display. The capacitive navigation keys are right below the display, which unfortunately isn't backlit. Power/lock key is on the right, accompanied by the volume rocker. On the left edge, there are two trays — one for dual SIM cards and another dedicated to the microSD card.The Redmi 5A sports an IR blaster on the top, alongside a secondary mic.On the bottom, there's a micro USB port with the primary microphone and the top of the phone houses a 3.5mm audio jack and an IR blaster, which is a feature many want. On the back panel, there's the primary camera, LED flash on the top left corner and the speaker grill is at the bottom, which also has a tiny protrusion to avoid audio blockage when the phone is placed on its back. Overall, the design and build are nothing extraordinary for those who've seen the 4A, but it's commendable for a device this cheap. It is handy, fits perfectly in pockets and doesn't feel bulky despite having a relatively big battery. Display5-inch display with a HD resolutionMay prove smaller for some, but it’s a bright and clear screen The display does not disappoint The Redmi 5A sports a 5-inch HD IPS LCD display with 720x1280 pixel resolution. When I compared this display with other budget smartphones in the same price range, the handset that came closest to this phone was the Redmi 4 itself. While the Redmi 4 has a sharper and punchier display, the Redmi 5A's display fits the bill for this price. The pixel density does come to 296 pixels per inch though, which means you'll struggle to spot any pixelation, unless you're very close to the screen.Colors look rich and vivid and can be tweaked using a manual adjustment in the display settings. Moreover, it offers a night mode for a comfortable reading experience in darkness, which is rare in this range. The display, while not revolutionary, offers a new standard in the ultra-budget range. It offers good sunlight visibility and we reckon this will be a norm for budget buyers soon.",Xiaomi Redmi 5A review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-5a,Sudhanshu Singh

Or you can buy it from some third-party retailers for £99.You can buy the Xiaomi Redmi 6A in India too with the price starting at Rs 5,999. You've actually been able to buy it in India since it launched in June 2018, though there's no clear plan for Xiaomi to bring the phone to the US or Australia.Design and displayImage 1 of 2Image 2 of 2The Xiaomi Redmi 6A is an affordable phone, and you'll instantly recognize that as soon as you pick it up in your hand.Considering its price, we found the Xiaomi Redmi 6A to feel quite premium in hand, with a metal effect on the rear of the device that's brushed to make it feel that bit more authentic.It's a good looking device considering that price, and along the bottom you'll find the microUSB port for charging while the top edge features a 3.5mm headphone jack. The power button and volume rocker are easy to reach on the right hand side.We've seen the black edition in our short time with the phone, but the device also comes in light blue, pink and gold colors as well.The display is where things aren't as premium, but that's to be expected at this price. The Redmi 6A comes with a HD+ resolution display that's 5.45-inches.That means you'll get 295 pixels per inch, and while that may not sound great on paper, there are many phones on the market that cost more than this but offer the same or slightly worst screen quality.We found the display to be bright in our quick test, and it's a great size for those who don't want a gargantuan phone. The bezels are thick around the top and bottom of the phone, but it features an 18:9 aspect ratio that makes it feel a little different to some other budget devices too.Battery life and cameraWhile we can't offer a verdict on the battery life on the Redmi 6A, we can say we'd expect it to last a full day as it has a 3000mAh battery inside. Considering there's not much to power on this phone, we'd expect it to do well in day-to-day usage.We'll be sure to test that properly when it comes time for our full review.There's a 13MP rear camera on this phone with an aperture of f/2.2, and while it won't take the best shot for your Instagram it's quite respectable when compared to other phones around this price.We took a few photos in our testing time and time-to-focus proved a little slower than we would have hoped, but it's unlikely to be enough to really frustrate you.For selfies, you've got a basic 5MP front-facing camera with the same aperture as the rear. Again, this won't blow you away but it's also not the worst we've seen at this end of the market.Performance and interfaceWhen you're spending this much on a phone, you shouldn't expect the performance you'd likely get from a Xiaomi Mi 8 Pro.It's sporting a MediaTek Helio A22 chipset, and we've yet to use that properly in another device so we can't offer much insight on its overall performance, but it's toward the low end of the power spectrum.Impressively, you can get it paired with 3GB of RAM in one edition of the Redmi 6A, and while it won't be able to run all of your mobile games at top spec it's sure to be able to run most of your apps. It may just take a little longer than you'd hope for them to load.There's a 2GB RAM version of the phone too that comes with 16GB of storage, while the 3GB sports 32GB. We'd advise not to go for a 16GB phone at all, as that's unlikely to be enough space for all of your apps and anything else you want to upload.It's currently not clear what version of the phone Xiaomi will be bringing to the UK.In terms of interface, the Redmi 6A comes with Android 8.1 software installed, so it's relatively new, and it has Xiaomi's own interface over the top of it.It looks good, but it's a different appearance to a lot of other phones on the market right now, so it may take you some time to get properly used to it when you first boot up the device.Early verdictThe Xiaomi Redmi 6A isn't going to floor you with its performance or features, but everything here seems to work well.Considering the price, you'll likely be happy with what the Redmia 6A can do and it keeps pace with other budget alternatives.",,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-6a,James Peckham

Or you can buy it from some third-party retailers for £99.You can buy the Xiaomi Redmi 6A in India too with the price starting at Rs 5,999. You've actually been able to buy it in India since it launched in June 2018, though there's no clear plan for Xiaomi to bring the phone to the US or Australia.Design and displayImage 1 of 2Image 2 of 2The Xiaomi Redmi 6A is an affordable phone, and you'll instantly recognize that as soon as you pick it up in your hand.Considering its price, we found the Xiaomi Redmi 6A to feel quite premium in hand, with a metal effect on the rear of the device that's brushed to make it feel that bit more authentic.It's a good looking device considering that price, and along the bottom you'll find the microUSB port for charging while the top edge features a 3.5mm headphone jack. The power button and volume rocker are easy to reach on the right hand side.We've seen the black edition in our short time with the phone, but the device also comes in light blue, pink and gold colors as well.The display is where things aren't as premium, but that's to be expected at this price. The Redmi 6A comes with a HD+ resolution display that's 5.45-inches.That means you'll get 295 pixels per inch, and while that may not sound great on paper, there are many phones on the market that cost more than this but offer the same or slightly worst screen quality.We found the display to be bright in our quick test, and it's a great size for those who don't want a gargantuan phone. The bezels are thick around the top and bottom of the phone, but it features an 18:9 aspect ratio that makes it feel a little different to some other budget devices too.Battery life and cameraWhile we can't offer a verdict on the battery life on the Redmi 6A, we can say we'd expect it to last a full day as it has a 3000mAh battery inside. Considering there's not much to power on this phone, we'd expect it to do well in day-to-day usage.We'll be sure to test that properly when it comes time for our full review.There's a 13MP rear camera on this phone with an aperture of f/2.2, and while it won't take the best shot for your Instagram it's quite respectable when compared to other phones around this price.We took a few photos in our testing time and time-to-focus proved a little slower than we would have hoped, but it's unlikely to be enough to really frustrate you.For selfies, you've got a basic 5MP front-facing camera with the same aperture as the rear. Again, this won't blow you away but it's also not the worst we've seen at this end of the market.Performance and interfaceWhen you're spending this much on a phone, you shouldn't expect the performance you'd likely get from a Xiaomi Mi 8 Pro.It's sporting a MediaTek Helio A22 chipset, and we've yet to use that properly in another device so we can't offer much insight on its overall performance, but it's toward the low end of the power spectrum.Impressively, you can get it paired with 3GB of RAM in one edition of the Redmi 6A, and while it won't be able to run all of your mobile games at top spec it's sure to be able to run most of your apps. It may just take a little longer than you'd hope for them to load.There's a 2GB RAM version of the phone too that comes with 16GB of storage, while the 3GB sports 32GB.

Redmi phones by Xiaomi have always been about providing a great smartphone experience at an affordable price. In a way, that has also set a trend which forced other OEMs to come up with value-for-money products for customers at the lower end of the spectrum. Now with players like Samsung and Realme in the running, the Redmi 7 is Xiaomi’s revamped attempt to win the affordable segment.If you look back at the Redmi 6, the Redmi 7 is a welcome upgrade, more so because it offers an all-new design language that compliments the Redmi Note 7 lineup. Having said that, does it have enough brawn to be your trusted companion? I have been using the Redmi 7 for more than a week now, and here’s what I found out.Price and availabilityThe base variant of the Redmi 7 starts at Rs 7,999 with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. A maxed out model with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage is also available at Rs 8,999.Now, this pricing puts the Redmi 7 eerily close to its distant cousins, the Redmi Y3 and Redmi Note 7. However, Redmi 7 caters to a different type of user base and in a price sensitive market such as ours, even a price difference of Rs 1,000 makes or breaks the decision.Redmi 7 is available online on Amazon India and Mi Store across India.Design and DisplayRedmi phones have a reputation for being strongly built, especially because of their longed usage of aluminum chassis. This saw a departure with the launch of Redmi Note 7 which features an all-glass construction. Now, on the Redmi 6, that transpires to a reflective coating on the rear panel with a gradient finish. We have the Comet Blue colour model with us, but the phone is also available in Eclipse Black and Lunar Red gradient finishes. By the way, Xiaomi calls this the Aura Smoke design as it uses a nano-spray to apply that gradient finish.The back has a bit of a curve around the edges which provides some grip to hold onto. However, the curve on the panel isn’t a gentle one and meets the chassis at a raised angle which makes for an additional grip. The phone is very handy to carry around. It weighs in at 180g and is 8.5mm at its thickest point.Due to the reflective nature of the back panel, smudges and fingerprints get easily attracted to it. In fact, within a week into the review duration, the plastic back showed signs of minor scratches and scuff marks. We’d recommend using the case which is bundled in-the-box to avoid any such situations.Image 1 of 2Image 2 of 2The camera module sits on the top left corner with a flash cutout below. The fingerprint sensor is easy to reach which makes unlocking a breeze.Image 1 of 2Image 2 of 2On the top edge, there’s a 3.5mm headphone jack alongside an Infrared blaster. The left edge houses the SIM tray with microSD card slot, while the volume rockers and power button are located on the right edge. On the bottom, there’s a micro-USB port with speaker grilles. Redmi 7 is P2i certified against usual splashes of water.  The front of the phone is mostly dominated by the 6.2-inch display with a u-shaped notch cut out. The bezels certainly look a bit thicker than usual and the screen has an HD+ (1520 x 720 pixels) resolution.Considering its price, I wasn’t hoping for a Full HD display anyway. The screen is topped with a layer of Corning’s Gorilla Glass 5 which is a nice touch. It should keep the signs of wear and tear at bay.Even though it has an HD display, the IPS panel offers better contrasts and accurate colors which makes it one of the best displays in the segment. In addition, the phone has great sunlight legibility and viewing angles. All of this makes for a pretty good screen to binge-watch your favorite shows on.Overall, the Redmi 7 is has a solid built and the new design on the back doesn’t make it look like a cheap rip-off. The plastic build isn’t too bad but will easily get scarred on the rear panel in the long run if not used with a case on. The display is one of the best you can get for the price and it gets pretty bright. The Redmi 7’s display will appease to the kind of users who consume a lot of audio-visual content on their phones.",Xiaomi Redmi 7 review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-7,Siddharth Chauhan

94,,2019-05-13T13:13:07Z,RaTkb3KUKCGUjbqL7inKMH,"Redmi 7 is Xiaomi’s latest phone under the Redmi moniker, after Redmi Note 7 and Redmi Y3, since going independent, earlier this year. Redmi phones by Xiaomi have always been about providing a great smartphone experience at an affordable price. In a way, that has also set a trend which forced other OEMs to come up with value-for-money products for customers at the lower end of the spectrum. Now with players like Samsung and Realme in the running, the Redmi 7 is Xiaomi’s revamped attempt to win the affordable segment.If you look back at the Redmi 6, the Redmi 7 is a welcome upgrade, more so because it offers an all-new design language that compliments the Redmi Note 7 lineup. Having said that, does it have enough brawn to be your trusted companion? I have been using the Redmi 7 for more than a week now, and here’s what I found out.Price and availabilityThe base variant of the Redmi 7 starts at Rs 7,999 with 2GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. A maxed out model with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage is also available at Rs 8,999.Now, this pricing puts the Redmi 7 eerily close to its distant cousins, the Redmi Y3 and Redmi Note 7. However, Redmi 7 caters to a different type of user base and in a price sensitive market such as ours, even a price difference of Rs 1,000 makes or breaks the decision.Redmi 7 is available online on Amazon India and Mi Store across India.Design and DisplayRedmi phones have a reputation for being strongly built, especially because of their longed usage of aluminum chassis. This saw a departure with the launch of Redmi Note 7 which features an all-glass construction. Now, on the Redmi 6, that transpires to a reflective coating on the rear panel with a gradient finish. We have the Comet Blue colour model with us, but the phone is also available in Eclipse Black and Lunar Red gradient finishes. By the way, Xiaomi calls this the Aura Smoke design as it uses a nano-spray to apply that gradient finish.The back has a bit of a curve around the edges which provides some grip to hold onto. However, the curve on the panel isn’t a gentle one and meets the chassis at a raised angle which makes for an additional grip. The phone is very handy to carry around. It weighs in at 180g and is 8.5mm at its thickest point.Due to the reflective nature of the back panel, smudges and fingerprints get easily attracted to it. In fact, within a week into the review duration, the plastic back showed signs of minor scratches and scuff marks. We’d recommend using the case which is bundled in-the-box to avoid any such situations.Image 1 of 2Image 2 of 2The camera module sits on the top left corner with a flash cutout below.

The company rose to fame with the Redmi Note 4 which went on to become the bestselling smartphone in India. Xiaomi sold more than 9.6 million units of it. It was crazy. Redmi Note 4 became the go-to phone for anyone looking to purchase a smartphone under-Rs 13,000 and its popularity spiked in leaps and bounds. Last year also saw various OEMs taking the plunge into providing dual cameras and 18:9 aspect ratio displays and companies like Honor went a step further to bring a quad core camera system.With Redmi Note 5 now in India, Xiaomi aims to reiterate itself as the king of budget smartphones. But in all this competition, can it make do with an old wine in a new bottle? We find out.Redmi Note 5 price and release dateXiaomi's Redmi Note 5 was launched in India on 14 February. The phone is Flipkart exclusive and is available in two variants starting from Rs 9,999 for the 3GB/32GB variant and Rs 11,999 for the 4GB/64GB variant.DesignWhen we first unboxed the phone and held it in our hands, it didn't feel any different from the Redmi Note 4. It isn't that much different from the older version - at least from the back. The Note 5 has a slimmer and a lighter profile when we compare it with last year's Note 4. One can argue that there wasn't anything wrong with the design so they didn't upgrade it, but using the same design language again is a bit of a bummer considering it's being portrayed as an ‘upgrade’.The rear panel of the phone is made out of aluminum while the top and bottom ends are plastic, accented by antenna bands. The phone is 8.1 mm thin and weighs just around 180 grams. The Note 5 has got some weight to it which makes it feel sturdy. The fingerprint sensor on the rear panel is fast, which is nice.There's a camera protrusion which wasn't present in the earlier version but is something users will have to deal with on the Note 5.The biggest difference, however, comes when you look at the front of the Redmi Note 5. Gone are the thick bezels and with them, the capacitive navigation buttons. As minimal bezel display becomes a norm for smartphones, letting go of dedicated navigation keys is an absolute must.If it hadn't been for the front, differentiating Redmi Note 5 from the Note 4 would have been a difficult task. Regardless, the Note 5 feels solid and is well worth the asking price.Image 1 of 4Image 2 of 4Image 3 of 4Image 4 of 4DisplayThe Redmi Note 5 comes equipped with a 5.99-inch, 18:9 aspect ratio display which has a FullHD+ resolution (2160x1080 pixels) and a pixel density of 403ppi. The display is one of the most predominant changes there is in this version. Xiaomi jumping the bandwagon on bringing 18:9 aspect ratio displays to the mid-range segment speaks volume about this recent shift in the smartphone market.In our usage, we found the display to be bright and crisp with good viewing angles. It is a bit on the warmer side of things but that is very negligible and users won't face any problems.Sunlight legibility is fairly good when it comes to readability. It's not the best, but for the price, it's more than justified.Reproduction of images on the screen and colors are accurate but because of a slightly warmer tone in the display we noticed earlier, some colors looked washed out.Overall, consuming content on the Note 5 - such as watching videos - shouldn't be a problem for a general user.Image 1 of 2Image 2 of 2",Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-note-5,Siddharth Chauhan

It isn't that much different from the older version - at least from the back. The Note 5 has a slimmer and a lighter profile when we compare it with last year's Note 4. One can argue that there wasn't anything wrong with the design so they didn't upgrade it, but using the same design language again is a bit of a bummer considering it's being portrayed as an ‘upgrade’.The rear panel of the phone is made out of aluminum while the top and bottom ends are plastic, accented by antenna bands. The phone is 8.1 mm thin and weighs just around 180 grams. The Note 5 has got some weight to it which makes it feel sturdy. The fingerprint sensor on the rear panel is fast, which is nice.There's a camera protrusion which wasn't present in the earlier version but is something users will have to deal with on the Note 5.The biggest difference, however, comes when you look at the front of the Redmi Note 5. Gone are the thick bezels and with them, the capacitive navigation buttons. As minimal bezel display becomes a norm for smartphones, letting go of dedicated navigation keys is an absolute must.If it hadn't been for the front, differentiating Redmi Note 5 from the Note 4 would have been a difficult task.

Xiaomi jumping the bandwagon on bringing 18:9 aspect ratio displays to the mid-range segment speaks volume about this recent shift in the smartphone market.In our usage, we found the display to be bright and crisp with good viewing angles.

102,,2018-02-16T09:51:42.46Z,zWVJYUueaoEoykCTfouYce,"2017 was a great year for Chinese electronics manufacturer Xiaomi. The company rose to fame with the Redmi Note 4 which went on to become the bestselling smartphone in India. Xiaomi sold more than 9.6 million units of it. It was crazy. Redmi Note 4 became the go-to phone for anyone looking to purchase a smartphone under-Rs 13,000 and its popularity spiked in leaps and bounds. Last year also saw various OEMs taking the plunge into providing dual cameras and 18:9 aspect ratio displays and companies like Honor went a step further to bring a quad core camera system.With Redmi Note 5 now in India, Xiaomi aims to reiterate itself as the king of budget smartphones.

Of these, the Redmi Note 6 Pro is one of the most compelling options.For an outlay of just under £200, buyers get 64GB of storage (with optional microSD expansion), 4GB of RAM, a Snapdragon 636 octa-core chipset, a 4,000mAh battery and more - this is a device designed to win spec-sheet wars.But with the brand having so little experience in the west, and against tough competition from the likes of Honor, Huawei, Motorola, Oppo and more, does the Redmi Note 6 Pro have what it needs to succeed?Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro price and availabilityOut nowCosts £189.99/$180/AU$320The Redmi Note 6 Pro is sold directly through Amazon for £189.99/$180 currently for the version with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, other cheaper combinations are available. The device is also available directly through Xiaomi’s UK website for £219 (3GB/32GB). Australian stores meanwhile are selling it from around AU$320.Note that in the US it’s the unlocked global version that’s being sold – no official availability has been confirmed for the US presently and this doesn’t seem likely to change.Image credit: TechRadarKey features3GB/4GB of RAMDual-lens cameras on front and backA key selling point of many Chinese phones is their selfie capabilities - the more cameras and beauty modes, the better. Xiaomi has obliged accordingly with the Redmi Note 6 Pro, for it features four cameras, two facing forward and two facing backward.The front has a 20MP main lens and a 2MP depth sensor accompanying it, along with more AI modes and beauty filters than a sensible person could shake a sensibly-sized stick at. The rear camera includes a 12MP f/1.9 main lens and a 5MP depth sensor.In addition there's an IR blaster, which can be used with the Mi Remote app to control various appliances, and a screen with a trendy notch cut-out. This screen has a stretched 19:9 aspect ratio and is 1080 x 2280 in resolution and 6.26 inches tall, which is around what one might expect for the price.Xiaomi has also gone to some lengths to ensure a sturdy design, with the frame being plastic while the rear is encased in metal, leaving the Redmi Note 6 Pro with a fairly premium feel for the price. It also comes with a slew of different color options, including a fetching hot pink shade.One thing the Redmi Note 6 Pro doesn't have though is NFC, which means you can't use this phone for contactless payments. It's a disappointing omission even at the price.Design8.3mm thick, 182gMetal backIn 2019, conventional wisdom tells us that the consumer wants tiny notches and glass designs, even at the budget end of the market. Based against this, the Redmi Note 6 Pro is positively retro, with a metal build and a large notch.It sports a metal black plate which is cool to the touch, with the sides being made of plastic. A fingerprint scanner (which is satisfyingly nippy) can be found on the rear, as can the subtle ‘Mi’ logo and the rear camera housing.Image credit: TechRadarThe left side is flush, aside from the dual-SIM/microSD card tray, the right is home to the power key and the volume rocker, and the bottom holds (boo) the micro USB slot.The top of the device has the 3.5mm headphone jack, the IR blaster and a noise-cancelling microphone, and lastly the front of the device holds the 19:9 1080 x 2280 screen and twin front-facing cameras in the large notch.The use of a micro USB port in a device being sold in 2019 feels more than a little anachronistic, especially given that the successor standard, USB-C, is so widely prevalent.Notches are now a point of contention, but in everyday use the presence of this ‘feature’ will bother only the most committed. Videos eliminate the notch through black bars and the interface is spaced out in such a way that its presence doesn’t interrupt notifications.At 182g, this device is a chunky monkey - though given the size of the battery crammed inside its frame, the space feels well used. It is certainly more hefty than the likes of the Huawei P Smart (2019) but that isn’t necessarily a disadvantage.In all, the Redmi Note 6 Pro is a phone which some may find clunky compared to the svelte offerings at the top of the market, but for the average user it shouldn't prove to be an issue - the trade-offs in screen size and battery life will be worth it.Screen1080 x 2280 resolutionStretches to 6.26 inchesIt needs to be said again, the notch on this device is a porker. Against teardrop notches and punch-hole cameras, on the shelf it does stand out.Image credit: TechRadarAs said before however, in everyday use it quickly fades away into the background. This is partly because the screen itself is simply very pleasant to use.It can get bright enough to use in moderately bright sunshine (although the auto-brightness is slightly iffy) and the large size allows for plenty of content to be fit in at once.Watching videos on the go using this phone is a very pleasant experience, and the resolution ensures that pixelation will only be visible to the most hardcore of peepers. One small issue out of the box however was that the color temperature was a little too cool for our liking - with whites having a blue-ish tinge to them.This is easily rectified using the in-built screen calibration tool, which allows the user to set their own white point and increase contrast among other options. Other than this, the screen shows vibrant colors and is pleasing to the eye.In all, and certainly for the price, this is a display which ticks all the right boxes, being bright, sharp and colorful.

It's priced close to Redmi Note 5, which has similar hardware but falls short in the camera department. Read more: Xiaomi Mi A2Even though Xiaomi has been at the top in terms of market share, we cannot ignore that users are now talking about the iterative design upgrades and ignorance towards Android updates. So, I tried to find out if the Redmi Y2 is an incremental upgrade over its predecessor or it's just another iterative upgrade. Looking at Xiaomi's track-record, the company has assured that they are all ears to feedback from their users, but what do we learn from the Y2? We'll find out in the review. Price and availabilityThe Xiaomi Redmi Y2 has been priced at Rs. 9,999 for the 3GB RAM variant and Rs. 12,999 for the 4GB RAM variant. It will be available in India in Elegant Gold, Rose Gold and Dark Grey color options exclusively from Amazon India and mi.com from June 12. The company will also sell the device at Mi Home stores.Design and displayRedmi Y1 looks a lot like the Mi A1 with vertical cameras.Like other Redmi phones, the Redmi Y2 is made out of metal. While in this case, the design language isn't the same as the Redmi 5 or even the Note 5 series. It's more like a Mi A1 having an 18:9 ratio in a longer form factor.The major distinctive element in the design the vertical camera module and two shiny separation lines as the antennae bands as seen on Samsung phones most recently. Rest of the design is strikingly similar to the Mi A1 and the Redmi Note 5 Pro. It has the same gentle curves on all its sides. It does not dig into the palm, but it does feel slippery because of the smooth curvy finish. The camera design at the rear is exactly what we've seen on Redmi Note 5 Pro. There's a slight protrusion. so considering a back cover would be a good idea to save it from scratches.It is heavy at 170 grams and is big in size (thanks to the elongated 6-inch display), which makes it slightly difficult to operate with one hand. There is a one-handed UI mode for better accessibility, but to be honest, I haven't used or seen people using it very often.The connectivity ports and buttons reside at the standard Xiaomi positions. That means the SIM and microSD slot is on the left and volume rocker and power/lock keys are on the right. A microUSB port, loudspeaker grill are at the bottom and there's an IR blaster and headphone jack on the top. The finish on the smartphone is the same as what we have seen on recently launched Redmi phones, so no surprise there. It's sturdy to hold and looks like it can survive a few drops from reasonable height. Redmi Y2 SpecificationsDimensions:  160.7 x 77.3 x 8.1 mmOS: Android 8.1 (Oreo)Screen size: 5.99 inchesResolution: 720 x 1440 pixelsCPU: Snapdragon 625RAM: 3GB/4GBStorage: 64GBBattery: 3,080mAhRear camera: 12MP + 5MPFront camera: 16MP From the front, it looks like any other Xiaomi phones with 18:9 display in this form factor.

The 5.99-inch HD+ unit looks good, and this is a consistent approach that Xiaomi follows with all their devices. Colours are warm and it's sharp enough too.

107,,2018-04-23T11:42:37.112Z,LqY2t6HX6croZg4pmQAaGK,"Asus created quite a buzz with its partnership with Flipkart last week and now they’ve come out with their latest phone, the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1. On paper, it checks off all the boxes that a mid-range phone should. The Zenfone Max Pro M1 doesn’t scream flashy, in fact, it doesn’t scream anything at all. The phone doesn’t have any defining feature that sets it apart from other phones in the same price range, but you know what? No other phone offers the same features for Rs 10 999. This phone has the potential to be one that offers one of the most value-for-money deals. But there’s a catch and a big one at that. Zenfone Max Pro M1 (Back)The outsideThe first thing you ever experience about a phone is how it feels in your hands. And, at that moment, you matter how many times you’ve told yourself not to judge a book by its cover, you judge nonetheless. Especially, when the phone feels good.The Zenfone Max Pro M1 is not a phone you can use in one hand. The 6-inch full HD screen ensures that your thumb always ‘can’t quite reach’ the other end of the display. It’s not a phone to be taken lightly either, and I mean that literally. Volume, power buttonsThe smartphone feels solid, and it even feels reassuring in your hands. All the bells and whistles are tucked in, to give a sleek exterior. Even the vertical dual camera on the back looks like it’s trying to be as subtle as possible. Unlike the big gaping speaker holes on Xiaomi phones, the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 features horizontal slits along the bottom that look more classy. If the phone had a personality, it would probably teeter towards ‘humble’.But humble, this phone is not. Zenfone Max Pro M1 screenThe insideWithin its aluminum structure lies the Snapdragon 636 Chipset, 3GB RAM, and 32GB storage. They’re basically the best you can expect from a mid-range phone. The Redmi Note 5 Pro also comes equipped with the same SoC. Albeit, the Xiaomi smartphone also starts at Rs 13,999 for the base model.To be fair, hardware alone is enough to make a phone worth its value. It’s about how well the software is optimized for that hardware. The Zenfone Max Pro M1, though not a part of Android One, runs on Stock Android. Gaming is a breeze no matter the game that you play. The best part is, that you don’t run out of battery when you’re binge gaming the whole night. The 5000mAh battery really does last for the longest time and doesn’t take too long to recharge either. Under constant gaming and messaging the phone lasted almost 48 hours and the recharge time for going from 20% to 100% was around an hour. Who doesn’t love a phone that charges quickly?Even the screen doesn’t disappoint in its Full HD glory. Although the colors are bright, there are visibility issues under the sun. Zenfone Max Pro M1 The catchHave you ever been so impressed with a device and then suddenly noticed something that will change things forever? Well, such is the case with the Zenfone Max Pro M1’s camera.  The camera starts to lag when you put on the beauty mode and the auto-focus (AF) on the camera is incredibly slow. Move a nanometer and the camera will catch the instability. In their defense, the company has said they are yet to roll out an update for the camera that should fix a lot of issues. Now about the photos themselves. The colors are drab, the edges at ill-defined and the so-called ‘Bokeh’ effect doesn’t know where to focus and where to blur. The camera doesn’t handle exposure well either with the bright spots melding into white and dark spots losing all detail.Image 1 of 12Artificial lightCamera samplesImage 2 of 12Artificial lightCamera samplesImage 3 of 12Selfie modeCamera samplesImage 4 of 12Artificial lightCamera samplesImage 5 of 12Natural lightCamera samplesImage 6 of 12Natural lightCamera samplesImage 7 of 12Indoor natural lightCamera samplesImage 8 of 12Natural lightCamera samplesImage 9 of 12Natural lightCamera samplesImage 10 of 12Bokeh mode - Inanimate objectCamera samplesImage 11 of 12Bokeh mode - Outdoor portraitCamera samplesImage 12 of 12Bokeh mode - Indoor portraitCamera samplesVerdictSo it’s as simple as that. The phone in itself is spectacular. If you don’t care about the camera, then you’re not going to get a better phone than the Asus Max Pro M1 at this price range. But then again, the camera has become an important extension for all of us.

On paper, it checks off all the boxes that a mid-range phone should. The Zenfone Max Pro M1 doesn’t scream flashy, in fact, it doesn’t scream anything at all. The phone doesn’t have any defining feature that sets it apart from other phones in the same price range, but you know what? No other phone offers the same features for Rs 10 999. This phone has the potential to be one that offers one of the most value-for-money deals. But there’s a catch and a big one at that. Zenfone Max Pro M1 (Back)The outsideThe first thing you ever experience about a phone is how it feels in your hands. And, at that moment, you matter how many times you’ve told yourself not to judge a book by its cover, you judge nonetheless. Especially, when the phone feels good.The Zenfone Max Pro M1 is not a phone you can use in one hand. The 6-inch full HD screen ensures that your thumb always ‘can’t quite reach’ the other end of the display. It’s not a phone to be taken lightly either, and I mean that literally. Volume, power buttonsThe smartphone feels solid, and it even feels reassuring in your hands. All the bells and whistles are tucked in, to give a sleek exterior. Even the vertical dual camera on the back looks like it’s trying to be as subtle as possible. Unlike the big gaping speaker holes on Xiaomi phones, the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 features horizontal slits along the bottom that look more classy. If the phone had a personality, it would probably teeter towards ‘humble’.But humble, this phone is not. Zenfone Max Pro M1 screenThe insideWithin its aluminum structure lies the Snapdragon 636 Chipset, 3GB RAM, and 32GB storage. They’re basically the best you can expect from a mid-range phone. The Redmi Note 5 Pro also comes equipped with the same SoC. Albeit, the Xiaomi smartphone also starts at Rs 13,999 for the base model.To be fair, hardware alone is enough to make a phone worth its value. It’s about how well the software is optimized for that hardware. The Zenfone Max Pro M1, though not a part of Android One, runs on Stock Android. Gaming is a breeze no matter the game that you play. The best part is, that you don’t run out of battery when you’re binge gaming the whole night. The 5000mAh battery really does last for the longest time and doesn’t take too long to recharge either. Under constant gaming and messaging the phone lasted almost 48 hours and the recharge time for going from 20% to 100% was around an hour. Who doesn’t love a phone that charges quickly?Even the screen doesn’t disappoint in its Full HD glory. Although the colors are bright, there are visibility issues under the sun. Zenfone Max Pro M1 The catchHave you ever been so impressed with a device and then suddenly noticed something that will change things forever? Well, such is the case with the Zenfone Max Pro M1’s camera.  The camera starts to lag when you put on the beauty mode and the auto-focus (AF) on the camera is incredibly slow. Move a nanometer and the camera will catch the instability. In their defense, the company has said they are yet to roll out an update for the camera that should fix a lot of issues. Now about the photos themselves. The colors are drab, the edges at ill-defined and the so-called ‘Bokeh’ effect doesn’t know where to focus and where to blur. The camera doesn’t handle exposure well either with the bright spots melding into white and dark spots losing all detail.Image 1 of 12Artificial lightCamera samplesImage 2 of 12Artificial lightCamera samplesImage 3 of 12Selfie modeCamera samplesImage 4 of 12Artificial lightCamera samplesImage 5 of 12Natural lightCamera samplesImage 6 of 12Natural lightCamera samplesImage 7 of 12Indoor natural lightCamera samplesImage 8 of 12Natural lightCamera samplesImage 9 of 12Natural lightCamera samplesImage 10 of 12Bokeh mode - Inanimate objectCamera samplesImage 11 of 12Bokeh mode - Outdoor portraitCamera samplesImage 12 of 12Bokeh mode - Indoor portraitCamera samplesVerdictSo it’s as simple as that. The phone in itself is spectacular. If you don’t care about the camera, then you’re not going to get a better phone than the Asus Max Pro M1 at this price range. But then again, the camera has become an important extension for all of us. It’s easier said than done to compromise on a feature that integral. ",Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 review,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/zenfone-max-pro-m1,Prabhjote Gill
