1720,32,/gear/2016/11/11/apple-iphone-7-review/,0,0,2016-11-11,apple-iphone-7-review, Abhijeet Mishra ,Apple iPhone 7 review: A great flagship for compact phone lovers,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/2016/11/11/apple-iphone-7-review/," The iPhone 7 is a product of many firsts for Apple. The company has removed the traditional headphone jack from its newest iPhone – a move that has received considerable criticism – and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are also the first iPhones to feature water and dust resistance. Apple’s iconic home button has also received a major overhaul – it’s no longer a real button, with the phone using pressure sensors and what Apple calls the Taptic engine to simulate clicks. Oh, and then there are the stereo speakers, a secondary rear camera for the iPhone 7 Plus, and the increase to 32GB of storage on the base model. But Apple has only made subtle changes elsewhere, including the design, which has remained the same for the last three years. Our Editor-in-chief Asif was vocal about his disappointment over the unchanged design (and the missing headphone jack) in his iPhone 7 Plus review but found the device to otherwise be an excellent smartphone. The Plus model of the iPhone is certainly the more popular of the two in a market like India, where consumers have an affinity towards large screens, but we all know a large number of people who still prefer their smartphones in compact sizes. That’s where the iPhone 7 comes in. The smaller iPhone continues to feature a 4.7-inch display, and this year, Apple has also made it less of a compromise compared to its larger sibling. Apart from a smaller battery, lesser (yet still enough to be called Retina) screen resolution, and just a single camera at the back, the iPhone 7 is pretty much the same as the iPhone 7 Plus when it comes to features and specifications. But is the iPhone 7 as good as the iPhone 7 Plus as far as the overall experience is concerned? More importantly, does it offer enough of an upgrade for owners of previous iPhones? Let’s find the answers in the official Gear by MySmartPrice review. Before we begin, I should point out that this review of the iPhone 7 will not cover its software, as that remains exactly the same as the iPhone 7 Plus’. The same goes for its cameras, as except for the lack of the secondary rear camera and its accompanying features (2x optical zoom and DSLR-level bokeh effects), the iPhone 7 is not any different from the iPhone 7 Plus in terms of image quality.  The overall design of the iPhone 7 remains unchanged from the iPhone 6S. The display is still the same size, the bezels around the display are still bigger than they should be, and the rear camera still juts out. The only real noticeable change is the redesign of the antenna bands at the back – instead of running straight across from edge to edge, they now go around the top and bottom curves of the device. Thanks to the smaller display, the iPhone 7 does well in one-handed usage. I don’t recall a single moment when I felt the phone was slipping out of my hand or being unwieldy, and the only times I used both hands on the device were when I was using the camera, watching a video, or playing a game. Of course, since this is an iPhone, the build quality is top notch. The design might not have changed in three years, but I personally feel Apple’s design language is still attractive enough to not feel outdated. After all, other than Samsung’s curved Galaxy S edge smartphones, every other phone’s design looks rather generic today.  Like the iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 7 gets water and dust resistance to make it more comfortable for you to use the phone in the rain and out on our dusty Indian streets. In contrast to other water resistant smartphones, the iPhone 7 has great loudspeakers as well. Its water and dust resistance isn’t as highly rated as the Galaxy S7’s, but that won’t really make a difference in day-to-day usage for most folks. As for the new ‘Taptic’ home button, I find it to be much better than a full blown button. While the original iPhone button is pretty much iconic at this point, many folks were tired of having to press it every time they wanted to wake the phone up or go to the home screen. The new button gives enough of a click-y feeling without needing a full press, and it’s especially useful when you have to double tap it to access the multitasking screen. Don’t listen to the naysayers on this one: the iPhone 7’s new home button implementation is great, and you will realize that a few days after using the device. Just like the government’s decision to put ₹500 and ₹1,000 rupee notes out of circulation for the greater good, the removal of the headphone jack is bound to be a problem for the common folk despite Apple’s best intentions (which is to make wireless audio a bigger reality). In a country like India where people save for months to buy an iPhone, it’s silly to expect them to then invest in a good pair of wireless earphones. Sillier still is the fact that they will have to use the lightning to 3.5mm connector to use their existing wired audio gear, and also remember to keep that connector with them every time they are going out. I’ll put in my personal experience here once again. I am not a big fan of using earphones/headphones and have not really faced a problem with the iPhone’s lack of a headphone jack. I use Bluetooth streaming in my car (which offers lower sound quality than an AUX cable, but higher convenience), and Bluetooth speakers to listen to music at home or the nice-yet-not-very-costly speakers I have attached to my desktop computer. I completely understand how the headphone jack is indispensable in today’s world, but the lack of it on the new iPhones is something you will have to bear with if you intend to get the latest and greatest from Apple.  At 4.7-inches, the iPhone is still the smallest flagship smartphone on the market, at least when it comes to the size of the display. The overall size of the phone is still a tad too large because of the bezel above and below the display, but as long as Apple sticks to a circular home button, that bezel will be necessary to maintain uniformity in the overall design. When it comes to display quality, the iPhone 7 – like the iPhone 7 Plus – has the best LCD display on any smartphone today. It’s bright, shows accurate colours that don’t look dull, and despite the lower resolution than on the Plus model, looks sharp. 3D Touch makes a return, so you can press slightly harder than usual on an app’s icon or in other parts of the interface to access additional options. But how much you use 3D Touch depends on the kind of user you are. Most folks will probably never make use of the 3D Touch functionality, except to maybe take a quick selfie by pressing hard on the camera icon. But those who do, will find 3D Touch to be rather great, especially with the additional features Apple has built around it in iOS 10 (for more information, check out our iPhone 7 Plus review). The only issue I had with the iPhone 7 was the display size. Being used to 5.5-inch Android smartphones, I had an issue with the 4.7-inch screen at times. Typing on the keyboard was the biggest hurdle – it’s easy to hit the wrong keys, and if you’re used to larger phones (even those with 5-inch displays), you will have to make a few changes to your typing habits. And iOS doesn’t make things easier either, with its small interface elements that remain the same across both the standard and the Plus models. For those of you thinking of switching from an Android phone to the iPhone 7, I would suggest you to go with the iPhone 7 Plus, unless a compact smartphone is what you are looking for.  We have already heaped praises on the stereo speakers on the iPhone 7 Plus, and I’ll do it here as well. Every other water resistant phone you can find in the market compromises on the quality of the loudspeaker (thanks to the waterproofing membrane that covers the speaker), but the iPhone 7 doesn’t suffer in the slightest. Its stereo speakers (one at the top of the display, and the other at the bottom, next to the lightning port) are great – they get very loud and also have noticeable depth to the sound, with pretty much no distortion even at the highest volume. The first time I started playing a game (N.O.V.A 3 by Gameloft), the iPhone 7 blew me away with its sound quality, something only the HTC One M8 has ever managed to do (the HTC 10, with the same implementation of stereo speakers, isn’t as great). It’s another reason why the missing headphone jack didn’t really bother me, and these speakers make for a wonderful listening experience. I wasn’t as enamored by the supplied earphones. At the highest volume, the earphones can be quite discomforting thanks to their focus on high frequencies (treble), which results in overly sharp audio. The earphones don’t have a lot of bass, and Apple continues to offer, what you call, average quality earphones with its iPhones even here in 2016. It’s sad, given how much the iPhones cost, but I guess this has never been a problem for the millions of people buying these devices or Apple would have done something about it by now. The iPhone 7 Plus offers screaming-fast performance, and so does its smaller cousin. The iPhone has always been the device to match up to when it comes to smartphone performance, but no device has actually managed to come close to the smoothness and quickness of an iPhone. There are many reasons for this. Apple’s tight control over and integration of its software and hardware is one, and the company’s desktop-class processors are another. Without getting too technical, let’s just say that the iPhone 7 is the fastest smartphone you can buy today, whether it be in terms of general usage or something as graphic-intensive as gaming or even video editing.  The iPhone 7 has 2GB of RAM, which is one gigabyte less than on the 7 Plus, but you will be hard-pressed to notice any differences between the two when it comes to multitasking. This is, in part, because even with 3GB of RAM, Apple doesn’t let too many apps run in the background, which means you aren’t missing out on anything. The iPhone 7’s lower screen resolution (750x1334p, which is much lesser than the Full HD resolution of competing phones) also means that apps require less memory to run properly. Except for being future-proof, the iPhone 7 offers plenty of RAM to handle anything you throw at it. Apple’s TouchID fingerprint sensor is fast as ever – you only need to keep your finger on the home button for a second to unlock the device or authenticate an app purchase in the App Store, and the only time you will see the iPhone 7 falter with fingerprint detection is, well, never. Okay, so placing your finger on the button the wrong way when you’re in a hurry or just distracted might result in a missed detection, but that is true for any smartphone with a fingerprint sensor in the market.  If you were getting weary of all the praises I’ve heaped on the iPhone 7, this is where things begin to go downhill. For the third year in a row, Apple has launched its 4.7-inch iPhone flagship with a small battery (1960mAh) that doesn’t last an entire day except on extremely frugal usage. While it is impressive that a smartphone as powerful as the iPhone 7 can last as long as it does with such a small battery (thanks to Apple’s optimization and iOS’ draconian control of background apps and services), there is still simply no excuse to ask people to fork out ₹60,000 for a smartphone with battery life that makes you reach for the charger by the end of your workday. The iPhone 7 also takes up considerably more battery when idle than the iPhone 7 Plus. Apple really needs to put in a bigger battery on its next non-Plus iPhone. If removing the headphone jack is a courageous move, a bigger battery is a sensible one that Apple should have made years ago. Thankfully, the smaller battery means the iPhone 7 is much faster at charging than the iPhone 7 Plus, despite the lack of fast charging. It takes around an hour and fifteen minutes to fully charge, although you will have to use a third-party charger with higher output current than Apple’s in-box charger. For the third year in a row, the smaller iPhone isn’t the best iPhone your money can buy. That spot is reserved for the iPhone 7 Plus, but for the first time, the regular iPhone is extremely close to its Plus cousin. The iPhone 7 disappoints only with the short battery life – it also doesn’t have the gimmicky-yet-fun-to-use secondary rear camera of the iPhone 7 Plus – but in all other respects, the iPhone 7 is as excellent a phone as the Plus model. I should also point out that like the iPhone 7 Plus, the iPhone 7 doesn’t have the best camera on the smartphone market. Google’s new Pixel phones (which we are currently reviewing) and the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge take better photos than the iPhone 7 in many conditions, and even the OnePlus 3 (review) can sometimes match Apple’s newest phone when it comes to camera quality despite costing less than ₹30,000. The competition is also offering better displays – AMOLED displays on the Android competition might go over the top with their vivid colours, but isn’t that what we all want from our smartphones displays anyway?  Yet, the iPhone 7 remains an excellent choice for anyone looking for a compact flagship smartphone. It’s a great upgrade for iPhone 6 owners, although iPhone 6S owners would do well to wait it out another year before upgrading. In the Android world, the Galaxy S7 (review) is the primary option if you’re looking for the best (it’s much cheaper than the base model of the iPhone 7 as well), and you can also take a look at the HTC 10. But if you really must stick to the Apple ecosystem and don’t like the idea of a huge screen, then the iPhone 7 is worth your hard-earned money. Don’t forget to check out our iPhone 7 Plus review for details on the camera and software, which are the same as for the iPhone 7."
2050,32,/gear/2017/05/20/samsung-galaxy-s8-s8-plus-review/,0,0,2017-05-20,samsung-galaxy-s8-s8-plus-review, Asif Iqbal Shaik ,Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Gorgeous smartphones from the future,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/2017/05/20/samsung-galaxy-s8-s8-plus-review/," Samsung faced a lot of negative publicity over the way it handled the Note 7 situation, and coming into 2017, the brand had to show that it can regain consumer trust. Samsung has always been great at making excellent phones — its flagships elevated the brand to the forefront of the Android ecosystem — but with the Galaxy S8, it also had to show customers that safety was a key priority. As a result, Samsung pushed back the launch of the Galaxy S8 by a month as it conducted additional safety tests to ensure the phones were up to the mark. Samsung has shown time and again that it can exceed its own milestones. Were it not for the battery malfunctions, the Galaxy Note 7 would’ve been one of the best device of 2016. For the Galaxy S8 series, the manufacturer took an even bolder design approach, with the phones featuring all-new Infinity Displays that are almost bezel-free. There are significant changes under the hood as well — the phones feature brand new and powerful 10nm octa-core 64-bit processors, increased storage, slightly improved cameras, and a newer UI design. Moreover, they also feature an immensely improved front-facing camera and a better rear-facing camera. They only thing that differs between the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is the screen size and battery capacity. The Galaxy S8 comes with a 5.8-inch display and a 3,000mAh battery, whereas the Galaxy S8+ comes with a 6.2-inch display and a 3,500mAh battery. Both smartphones feature a fast iris scanner as an added security mechanism. Following its acquisition of famed audio maker Harman Kardon, the manufacturer is also bundling AKG-tuned earphones with the Galaxy S8 and S8+. But are the changes enough to solidify Samsung’s position in the smartphone market and rebuild consumer trust? I’ve been using them as my primary phones since I received review units of both these smartphones three weeks ago. Let’s find out how they perform in real-life conditions in our Galaxy S8 and S8+ review.   The first thing that you’ll notice on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is their larger, almost bezel-free screen. There’s a small amount of bezel on the top and the bottom of the display, but nowhere else. The sides and corners of the phones are curved. The phone is covered by Gorilla Glass 5 panels on the front and the back. These glass panels meet the metal frame seamlessly, so much so that the whole phone feels like a unified slab of glass and metal. You can’t feel where the glass panel ends and the metal rim starts, and that evokes a sense of beauty that few phones can match up to.  All the sensors – accelerometer, ambient light, hall effect, iris, and proximity – as well as the front-facing camera and the earpiece are located above the display. There’s no physical home button or capacitive back and multitasking buttons on these smartphones, with Samsung switching to on-screen navigation buttons for its smartphones. The on-screen home button is pressure-sensitive, and you can long-press it to go to the home screen no matter where you are in the phone’s software. You can also press the virtual home button while the phone is in sleep mode to wake it up. I think more Android OEMs should start using such pressure-sensitive buttons. [masterslider id=”5″] The power button on the right side and the volume buttons on the left have a decent amount of travel and offer great tactile feedback. There’s an additional physical button below the volume rocker that’s dedicated to summon Bixby (Samsung’s new digital voice assistant). I’ll talk more on Bixby later in this review. The headphone jack is at the bottom, so it’s easier to use the phone with headphones. There’s a USB Type-C port between the loudspeaker and the headphone jack. The hybrid dual-SIM card slot is at the top of the phone, and it has a rubber gasket, making the phone resistant to water and dust. The fingerprint sensor is placed beside the camera sensor on the back of these smartphones. I had to struggle to reach the fingerprint reader on these smartphones, particularly more so on the Galaxy S8+. You are definitely going to smudge the camera lens trying to access the fingerprint reader. However, I got accustomed to it after a couple of weeks. You’ll be able to locate the fingerprint reader more easily by putting a case. The placement of the Bixby button right opposite to the power button doesn’t help at all. I accidentally pressed the Bixby button quite a few times when I was trying to wake up the device from sleep.  While the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are stunning to behold, they also feel extremely fragile. Thanks (or no thanks) to the glass panels on the front and the back, the phones are susceptible to damage if dropped onto hard surfaces. If it were to me, I would buy a case for the Galaxy S8 or S8+ to save it from drops. Yes, it feels wrong to cover such beautiful devices in a case, but it’s better than the constant fear of shattering the panel. Xiaomi was the first brand to start the bezel-free smartphone design with the Mi Mix, but the phone looked like a prototype, while the Galaxy S8 feels like a finished product in comparison. The physical design of the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+ will serve as the frame of reference for all smartphones in the future. The design of these devices puts other smartphones manufacturers to shame (especially Apple, Google, and HTC). Compared to the Galaxy S8 and S8+, competing smartphones like the iPhone 7, Pixel, and HTC U Ultra feel like they have a lot of catching up to do in the design segment. Just like the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge (and the not-so-lucky Galaxy Note 7), the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are IP68-certified for dust and water resistance. You can dip the Galaxy S8 or the S8+ in water (not more than 1.5 meter deep) for up to 30 minutes, and no damage will be done to either device. That’s a better rating than the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. This should give users peace of mind when they’re holidaying on the beach, having a pool party, or when going out while it’s raining.  Samsung has been an undisputed leader in the smartphone display category for the past two to three years now with its Super AMOLED displays, but this year it has pushed the boundaries even further. The Infinity Display is undoubtedly the standout feature on the Galaxy S8 and S8+, and it marks the focus point of Samsung’s marketing budget. So what exactly is the Infinity Display? It’s a QHD+ Super AMOLED display panel from Samsung on steroids. It has a 18.5:9 ratio, a claimed peak brightness of up to 1000 nits for HDR, curved edges and curved corners. There’s an improved version of Always On Display, which shows not only widgets for date and time, but also music player controls and alarms. It also features colourful backgrounds. Samsung’s new Infinity Wallpapers (a combination of wallpapers for Always On Display, home screen, and lock screen) look great on these displays. The Galaxy S8 comes with a 5.8-inch display, while the larger Galaxy S8+ features a 6.2-inch display. Apart from the display size and pixel density, everything else remains the same among these two smartphones. In my testing, I found the displays to be bright and full of oversaturated colours, making it a delight to read content and view videos. Colour calibration is accurate too, but some units have been facing a red tint issue. I also noticed this issue on a review unit, and Samsung has acknowledged the problem and started rolling out a software update. The update gives you greater control over the colour calibration, and you can tweak the settings to minimize the red tint. Since these displays have an aspect ration of 18.5:9, you are bound to see letter-boxing or pillar-boxing, depending on whether you’re using the phone in landscape or portrait mode. Samsung has tried to solve this issue by offering a zoom-in mode. This feature can be activated by clicking the crop to fit button that appears while you’re watching any video. While this is not the most elegant solution — some portion of the video would be cropped — it is the best option to take full advantage of that gorgeous panel. All-in-all, these are pretty much the best displays you can find on a smartphone today. The Infinity Displays on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ can achieve a peak brightness of up to 1000 nits and cover 113 percent of DCI-P3 colour gamut as well as 142 percent of sRGB colour spaces. Therefore, they have been certified by the UHD Alliance as HDR-compatible displays. Both smartphones have HDR10 and Mobile HDR Premium certifications. The company has inked partnerships with Amazon Prime Video and other video streaming platforms to offer HDR content to the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Netflix and YouTube are yet to rollout HDR support for these smartphones, though, but it’s only a matter of time before these services start offering HDR videos on the phones.  Samsung is shipping its newest version of UX (now called Samsung Experience 8.0) with the Galaxy S8 and S8+, with the skin built on top of Android 7.0 Nougat. This version of TouchWiz has several new features than the one on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. It also features an overhauled app drawer and a home screen setup. The whole user experience feels quite modern, more so than the stock Android user experience. A few aspects of the UI – app launcher and fingerprint reader gestures – have been inspired by the Pixel and the Pixel XL. There’s no dedicated button to open the app drawer now. All you have to do is swipe up or down on the home screen to show all the app icons. Since it’s hard to reach the notifications area due to the unusually long screen of the S8 and S8+, there’s an option which you can activate to use the swipe down gesture on the fingerprint reader to bring down the notification shade — similar to what you’d do on the Google Pixel. However, the problem here is that the fingerprint reader is located high up on the phone, which is harder to locate when compared to the fingerprint reader on the Pixel (which is at the centre of its back). Samsung should have had used the home screen swipe down gesture to access notifications, which would’ve made the gesture easier to use. Quick setting toggles can be arranged according to your liking using the Button Order option. You can even choose how many toggles appear in one go by changing the Button Grid option. By default, the screen brightness slider doesn’t appear when you swipe down the notifications shade the first time (you have to swipe down twice to see it). However, you can set it to appear on the first time by clicking the down arrow button beside the brightness slide and activating the ‘show control on top’ option. Samsung was the first to offer side-by-side multitasking over three years ago, and with the feature now integrated into Android 7.0 Nougat, the manufacturer is making a few additions. Tapping the multitasking button reveals all the apps that are open, and you can not only run two apps side by side, but also choose to show a particular part of an app. This is useful when you want to focus only on one area/part of an app while using two apps simultaneously. If you want to switch the location of two active apps in side-by-side multitasking, you can do that too. As always, apps can be used in a small window hovering over whatever screen you’re on. Samsung introduced themes for Galaxy smartphones starting with the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. There’s a dedicated Theme Store where you can find official themes from Samsung as well as third-party themes from other developers. There are a few brilliant themes in there, and if you’re one for stock Android UI, you can download plenty of third-party themes that can make your Galaxy S8 or S8+’s UI like that of the Pixel. Theme packs include custom wallpapers, backgrounds, AoD widgets and backgrounds, icons, dialer design, and more. Some new themes also include Infinity Wallpapers for that stunning screen. SideSync from Samsung is one of the most downplayed features on Galaxy smartphones and tablets. The feature essentially lets you mirror the smartphone screen on your desktop and control it using your PC’s keyboard and mouse. It can be used to drag and drop files from PC to smartphone and vice versa. It can also keep your PC’s and smartphone’s clipboard in sync. You can even see your smartphone notifications on a connected PC and reply to them without leaving your computer. The Smart Switch app that comes pre-installed on most Samsung phones these days allows quick transfer of data from an old phone to a new one. It can be done wirelessly over Wi-Fi or through a wired connection using a compatible USB cable. Data includes images, videos, documents, alarms, contacts, calendar entries, apps, games, wallpapers, and more. Pretty much everything can be transferred from an old phone to the Galaxy S8 and S8+ quickly — and it supports both Android devices and iPhones. However, note that your iPhone needs to be unencrypted in order to transfer the data. Secure Folder is an improvement over last year’s Private Mode and KNOX features. It’s a place where you can save confidential information — including apps, images, videos, documents, files, and more. You can move images and videos from the gallery to Secure Folder. This folder can be opened by your registered fingerprints, iris, or a pin code. It is secured by Samsung’s KNOX security suite, which is claimed to offer defense-grade security mechanism. Moreover, it can also be used for dual apps functionality, so you can use it for dual WhatsApp if you’re using two SIM cards at once.  Bixby is Samsung’s take on an AI-powered digital voice assistant. Apart from showing useful information cards from stock and third-party apps like Facebook, Twitter, and Uber, it can recognise a user’s voice and act on voice commands. Samsung claims that Bixby Voice (Bixby’s voice assistant) can be asked to perform any task using voice that a user can otherwise perform by touching the smartphone’s display. For example, you can ask Bixby to find all the images of food that you took on a particular day and email it to your family members. This is just one example, and you perform almost any task on your smartphone just through voice commands. However, it is launched only in South Korea as of now, and we’re not sure if it will hit the Indian market this year. Moreover, Bixby Now (the feature that shows information cards) can show information from only a handful of partner apps, so it’s kind of useless as of now. Overall, there’s not much that Bixby can offer to Galaxy S8 and S8+ users in India. The service is still in its infancy, but it has the potential to become something great. Until then, however, best disable it.  The Galaxy S8 and S8+ feature 12-megapixel rear-facing cameras with F1.7 aperture, OIS, and 4K video recording. It might sound similar to last year’s Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, but time around, Samsung used a slightly newer camera sensor (Sony IMX320 or Samsung LSI S5K3H1). We will get into how it helps the Galaxy S8 take more accurate images shortly. The phones can also record optically and digitally stabilized 4K videos or 240fps slow-motion videos. There are a lot of other software features, but let’s first focus on the UI of the camera app. It’s quite simple to begin with. There’s a still image shutter button and a video record button. There are shortcuts to adjust flash, HDR, front or rear-facing camera toggle, stickers (Snapchat style), and skin tone (also called as air brushing). There’s a shortcut to the gallery app as well. You can drag the shutter button up or down to zoom in or out (digitally, of course). All the other settings like image and video resolutions, tracking autofocus, shape correction, shooting methods, stabilisation, and storage location are hidden in the app’s settings menu.  Thanks to the newer sensor and a more capable ISP used in the newer Exynos 8895 chipset, Samsung has been able to employ a better image processing algorithm – Multi Frame Processing – to offer better quality stills. Samsung says that Multi Frame Processing consists of capturing three images every time the shutter button is clicked. These images are then used to output one still image that has better dynamic range, colours, and sharpness. Thanks to more processing bandwidth, Samsung was able to digitally stabilise 4K videos, something that wasn’t available in the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. [masterslider id=”6″] The quality of the images captured using the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is one of the best in the world right now (in the smartphone category, of course). Still images come out sharp, and with plenty of details. Dynamic range is pretty wide, but still not as good as the Google Pixel (which uses HDR+ algorithm to stitch nine images into one final image with exceptionally wide dynamic range). These phones tend to oversaturate colours sometimes, but most people like it that way. If you don’t want artificial changes, you can use the Pro Mode in the camera app to adjust the final results. There’s Auto Live HDR that showcases how the final image would look like even before the shutter button is clicked.  4K videos recorded using the S8 and S8+ have plenty of detail, and the audio quality is really good, thanks to higher bitrate audio capture. OIS and EIS work in tandem, so you get pretty smooth videos. However, if you’re jogging or walking fast while recording a video, you can notice a jello effect in the corners. The front-facing camera can record QHD videos, but there’s no OIS, and EIS isn’t activated as well. So, if you’re planning to capture a video using the front-facing camera while walking fast, make sure you stick to 1080p. Thanks to the fast Dual Pixel phase-detection autofocus mechanism in the camera, there’s no focus hunting. Even the focus transition is extremely smooth, so videos look like they’ve been captured by professionals. The front-facing 8MP camera (with F1.7 aperture) on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ features autofocus mechanism, a first in a Samsung smartphone. This greatly improves the quality of self portraits (or selfies as we call them these days). Images come out sharp with much more details than what I’ve seen on the S7 and S7 edge. However, I’ve noticed that sometimes the camera adjusts the focus point just before you hit the shutter button, which results in blurred images. This is nitpicking though. The selfie camera has a wide-angle lens, and you can fit in a lot of people (or background) in the frame. Moreover, autofocus helps a lot in video calls as well. All in all, it’s a great front-facing camera, and there are not a lot of phones that have better front-facing cameras than the S8 and S8+.  The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come equipped with the Exynos 8895 octa-core processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB of internal storage, and a hybrid dual-SIM card, meaning you can use the SIM 2 slot for storage expansion via a microSD card. The Exynos 8895 rivals the Snapdragon 835 from Qualcomm and the Kirin 960 from Huawei in terms of features and performance. It is built using Samsung’s 10nm FinFET LPP process, uses ARM’s powerful Mali-G71MP20 GPU, and comes with an integrated gigabit LTE mode. Ideally, this beastly chip should be able to make any smartphone very, very fast. However, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ aren’t as smooth as I hoped. Yes, they run through everyday tasks without breaking a sweat, but the UI itself isn’t as fluid as that on the iPhone or the Pixel. I was able to notice a few stutters here and there, especially when the phones connect to a new internet connection. Samsung has made great improvements in UI design, but it is still unable to offer a UI that consistently hits the 60fps frame rate. I don’t know why it is so hard for Samsung to develop a UI that is as smooth as the one on iPhone or Pixel. No matter how fast the underlying chipset is in a Galaxy smartphone, it is never as smooth as competing phones from Apple, Google, OnePlus, or even Xiaomi. Maybe Samsung is using a different benchmark to measure performance, but in my view, the chipset that should be the fastest in the world isn’t working up to its potential in the Galaxy S8 and S8+ because of Samsung’s inability to optimize its skin. When it comes to multitasking though, 4GB of fast LPDDR4 RAM in the S8 and S8+ works well. I never noticed any app getting closed due to too many apps being stored in the memory. As opposed to what many other brands might say, I think that 4GB of RAM is enough in this day and age, especially when Android has become so intelligent in app management. Android O is expected to make it even better, all thanks to improved restrictions on background tasks. Gaming is very smooth, all thanks to the Mali G71MP20 GPU, which is slightly faster than the Adrneo 540 chipset used in the Snapdragon 835. For the first time ever, Samsung’s Exynos chipset is able to outperform Qualcomm’s comparable Snapdragon solution when it comes to graphics crunching abilities. All the games that I tried – Asphalt 8, GTA IV, Modern Combat 5, and Real Racing 3 – worked flawlessly, at least as long as you’re operating the phone in normal environmental temperatures. There was one instance when I was out in the open, under harsh sunlight (and India’s summers can be quite brutal), and the Galaxy S8 heated up considerably. The chipset throttled, and as a result, the phone’s UI was stuttering a lot. This goes on to show that even the most powerful smartphones can experience stutters when pushed to their limits. Thankfully, this was only a one-off experience, and not a daily occurance. The 64GB UFS2.1 storage chip used in these phones is fast, but in day-to-day performance, you will not see a difference compared to UFS 2.0 chips used in the Galaxy S6 or S7. These chips are still not as fast as NVMe storage chips used in the latest iPhones, though. If you plan to store all your images, videos, and multimedia data on a microSD card, make sure that you buy at least a UHS-1 class card. The fingerprint reader on the back of the phones seems slower and less accurate than the ones I am accustomed to even in the entry-level phones like the Redmi 3s Prime. I noticed that it denied authentication my fingerprints if I didn’t cover the complete surface area.  On the other side, the iris scanner is amazing. Google hasn’t built a centralized API for an iris scanner, so it won’t be able to replace the fingerprint reader in apps where you are supposed to authenticate using fingerprints. If your bank’s app or a password manager allows you to use fingerprints as an authentication system, you won’t be able to replace it with your iris yet. I hope Google includes iris scanning mechanism in the Nexus Imprint API with the final release of Android O. The loudspeaker on the S8 and S8+ is louder than their predecessors, but it still falls short. I was hoping that Samsung would use AKG’s audio expertise in the Galaxy S8’s loudspeaker to include a stereo setup, but it didn’t. Hopefully, that will be amended later this year with the Galaxy Note 8. If Apple can offer a powerful stereo loudspeaker experience on its new iPhones, while still being IP67-certified, why can’t Samsung? In comparison, loudspeaker setups on the latest iPhones and the HTC U Ultra have been pretty impressive.  The cellular signal reception is quite good, thanks to the glass-covered body. Unless you cover the whole device with both your palms, you should be able to get good quality signal. Moreover, the earpiece is very clear and loud, and the noise cancellation works well. I used the phones for three weeks on Airtel’s 4G LTE service in Hyderabad, India. Wi-Fi reception was great too, thanks to 4×4 MUMO dual-band Wi-Fi ac. Bluetooth 5.0’s hugely improved bandwidth allowed Samsung to employ a feature wherein you can connect two Bluetooth wireless headphones or speakers to the Galaxy S8 (or the S8+) at the same time, allowing you to stream wireless audio on both the connected devices at once. It isn’t perfect though, as you can see a delay between both streams. The phones are also compatible with Google Cast and Samsung Connect. If you own a Google Cast compatible device like Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, or a Mi TV Box, you’ll be able to stream content from your phone to your TV or speakers over Wi-Fi. Samsung Connect only works with Samsung’s audio-video products, though, so unless your home is filled with compatible Samsung products, I doubt you’ll ever use it. The S8 and S8+ offer a 3.5mm headphone jack, so you can use any standard headphone that you like. Samsung is going out of the way to offer AKG-tuned in-ear canal earphones with every Galaxy S8 and S8+. The wires are braided and tangle-resistant, so it’s easier to carry it with you. Moreover, they also come with in-line microphone and audio controls. These are, by far, the best bundled earphones that I’ve ever used. They not only fit effortlessly and comfortable, but also sound very good. You might argue that you can get much better-sounding pair of buds for $99. However, for most consumers, they’re much better than what they’re normally used to.  Samsung Pay is one of the most important features on Samsung smartphones these days. It’s the company’s mobile payments solution that’s being included in higher mid-range and high-end Galaxy smartphones. It uses a combination of MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) and NFC features to let you pay at stores and outlets without a need for an actual credit or debit card. The MST feature in the Galaxy S8 and S8+ (and some other Samsung smartphones and smartwatches) mimics a card swipe, so the PoS (Point of Sale) terminal is forced into thinking that a card has been swiped. You just need to register all your credit, debit, and loyalty cards into the Samsung Pay app once. Don’t worry, all your card and financial data is kept secured using the KNOX security suite and your fingerprints. Samsung has partnered with the following banks for the Indian market: American Express, Axis Bank, Citibank, HDFC, ICICI, SBI, and Standard Chartered. More banks and financial institutions will join Samsung Pay in the future. I tried it at different stores, and since it was the first time merchants saw, they first said that it won’t work on their terminals, but then they were amazed once it worked. Samsung Pay is a real life-saver in an event where you forget your wallet at your home. However, it won’t work in case you are converting a transaction into an EMI. That type of transaction requires a chip & PIN authentication. Samsung has also partnered with a bunch of brands to offer your discounts and cashbacks if you use Samsung Pay.  Similar to the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, Samsung continued with 3,000mAh and 3,500mAh batteries in the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+ respectively. When you look at the screen size to battery capacity ratio of these devices, it would appear that they don’t have nearly enough to offer satisfactory battery life. However, they can generally last throughout the day, especially the Galaxy S8+. They also feature rapid charging abilities (both wired and wireless), so you can top up the batteries in a short time, in case they die before the end of the day. Thanks to the frugal 10nm Exynos 8895 processor, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ don’t consumer as much power as their predecessors. These phones lose very little battery charge in sleep mode. Samsung has also used a dedicated IC for the AoD mode in both these phones to minimize power drain. However, you would be better off without activating the AoD mode in the Galaxy S8 because it has a smaller capacity battery. Even though Samsung set the default screen resolution to FHD+ (2200 x 1080 pixels), I didn’t notice much of a difference in battery life when set to the highest possible resolution: QHD+ (2960 x 1440 pixels). In my usage, which includes four emails accounts on sync, half a dozen IM apps, a dozen media streaming apps, and all the popular social networking apps, the Galaxy S8+ offered satisfactory battery life with almost all the important features enabled. The Galaxy S8 isn’t as good as the Galaxy S8+ for some reason. The Galaxy S8 usually lasted around 16-18 hours with 3-3.5 hours of screen-on time, while the Galaxy S8+ usually lasted around 20-24 hours with a screen-on time of anywhere between 3.5-4.5 hours. If you want to go with the Galaxy S8 because of its compact size, be sure to disable AoD and a few other features. Samsung also claims that its new batteries, which pass through the 8-point safety check, can retain up to 95 percent of charge capacity even after one year of normal usage. That’s up from just 80 percent charge capacity of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. This means that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ should be able to offer almost similar battery life after one year of usage as it used to when using a brand new device.  We’re yet to review the LG G6, but we already know that it’s not as feature rich as the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Moreover, HTC and Apple are yet to announce their flagship smartphones for 2017. So, is the Galaxy S8 the best Android smartphone of the year? Well, we can’t say for sure since there are a few other devices – HTC U 11, LG G6, Mi 6, OnePlus 5, and the Sony Xperia XZ Premium – that we need to review. However, what we can say for sure is that the Galaxy S8 and the S8+ are one of the most impressive smartphones that we’ve tested so far. They feature brilliant screens, excellent processors, fast and reliable cameras, decent battery life, and the impressive Samsung Pay. Of course, Samsung could’ve made them even better if it had used a better fingerprint sensor, stereo speakers, and slightly larger capacity batteries, but as a package, they’re the best phones in the market today.

2050,32,/gear/2017/05/20/samsung-galaxy-s8-s8-plus-review/,0,0,2017-05-20,samsung-galaxy-s8-s8-plus-review, Asif Iqbal Shaik ,Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8+ review: Gorgeous smartphones from the future,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/2017/05/20/samsung-galaxy-s8-s8-plus-review/," Samsung faced a lot of negative publicity over the way it handled the Note 7 situation, and coming into 2017, the brand had to show that it can regain consumer trust. Samsung hasÂ always been great at making excellent phones â its flagships elevated the brand to the forefront of the Android ecosystem â but with the Galaxy S8, it also had to show customers that safety was a key priority. As a result, Samsung pushed back the launch of the Galaxy S8 by a month as it conducted additional safety tests to ensure the phones were up to the mark. Samsung has shown time and again that it can exceed its own milestones. Were it not for the battery malfunctions, the Galaxy Note 7 wouldâve been one of the best device of 2016. For the Galaxy S8 series, the manufacturer took an even bolder design approach, with the phones featuring all-new Infinity Displays that are almost bezel-free. There are significant changes under the hood as well â the phones feature brand new and powerful 10nm octa-core 64-bit processors, increased storage, slightly improved cameras, and a newer UI design. Moreover, they also feature an immensely improved front-facing camera and a better rear-facing camera. They only thing that differs between the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is the screen size and battery capacity. The Galaxy S8 comes with a 5.8-inch display and a 3,000mAh battery, whereas the Galaxy S8+ comes with a 6.2-inch display and a 3,500mAh battery. Both smartphones feature a fast iris scanner as an added security mechanism. Following its acquisition of famed audio maker Harman Kardon, the manufacturer is also bundling AKG-tuned earphones with the Galaxy S8 and S8+. But are the changes enough to solidify Samsungâs position in the smartphone market and rebuild consumer trust? Iâve been using them as my primary phones since I received review units of both these smartphones three weeks ago. Letâs find out how they perform in real-life conditions in our Galaxy S8 and S8+ review.   The first thing that youâll notice on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is their larger, almost bezel-free screen. Thereâs a small amount of bezel on the top and the bottom of the display, but nowhere else. The sides and corners of the phones are curved. The phone is covered by Gorilla Glass 5 panels on the front and the back. These glass panels meet the metal frame seamlessly, so much so that the whole phone feels like a unified slab of glass and metal. You canât feel where the glass panel ends and the metal rim starts, and that evokes a sense of beauty that few phones can match up to.  All the sensors â accelerometer, ambient light, hall effect, iris, and proximity â as well as the front-facing camera and the earpiece are located above the display. Thereâs no physical home button or capacitive back and multitasking buttons on these smartphones, with Samsung switching to on-screen navigation buttons for its smartphones. The on-screen home button is pressure-sensitive, and you can long-press it to go to the home screen no matter where you are in the phoneâs software. You can also press the virtual home button while the phone is in sleep mode to wake it up. I think more Android OEMs should start using such pressure-sensitive buttons. [masterslider id=”5″] The power button on the right side and the volume buttons on the left have a decent amount of travel and offer great tactile feedback. Thereâs an additional physical button below the volume rocker thatâs dedicated to summon Bixby (Samsungâs new digital voice assistant). Iâll talk more on Bixby later in this review. The headphone jack is at the bottom, so itâs easier to use the phone with headphones. Thereâs a USB Type-C port between the loudspeaker and the headphone jack. The hybrid dual-SIM card slot is at the top of the phone, and it has a rubber gasket, making the phone resistant to water and dust. The fingerprint sensor is placed beside the camera sensor on the back of these smartphones. I had to struggle to reach the fingerprint reader on these smartphones, particularly more so on the Galaxy S8+. You are definitely going to smudge the camera lens trying to access the fingerprint reader. However, I got accustomed to it after a couple of weeks. Youâll be able to locate the fingerprint reader more easily by putting a case. The placement of the Bixby button right opposite to the power button doesnât help at all. I accidentally pressed the Bixby button quite a few times when I was trying to wake up the device from sleep.  While the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are stunning to behold, they also feel extremely fragile. Thanks (or no thanks) to the glass panels on the front and the back, the phones are susceptible to damage if dropped onto hard surfaces. If it were to me, I would buy a case for the Galaxy S8 or S8+ to save it from drops. Yes, it feels wrong to cover such beautiful devices in a case, but itâs better than the constant fear of shattering the panel. Xiaomi was the first brand to start the bezel-free smartphone design with the Mi Mix, but the phone looked like a prototype, while the Galaxy S8 feels like a finished product in comparison. The physical design of the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+ will serve as the frame of reference for all smartphones in the future. The design of these devices puts other smartphones manufacturers to shame (especially Apple, Google, and HTC). Compared to the Galaxy S8 and S8+, competing smartphones like the iPhone 7, Pixel, and HTC U Ultra feel like they have a lot of catching up to do in the design segment. Just like the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge (and the not-so-lucky Galaxy Note 7), the Galaxy S8 and S8+ are IP68-certified for dust and water resistance. You can dip the Galaxy S8 or the S8+ in water (not more than 1.5 meter deep) for up to 30 minutes, and no damage will be done to either device. Thatâs a better rating than the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. This should give users peace of mind when theyâre holidaying on the beach, having a pool party, or when going out while itâs raining.  Samsung has been an undisputed leader in the smartphone display category for the past two to three years now with its Super AMOLED displays, but this year it has pushed the boundaries even further. The Infinity Display is undoubtedly the standout feature on the Galaxy S8 and S8+, and it marks the focus point of Samsungâs marketing budget. So what exactly is the Infinity Display? Itâs a QHD+ Super AMOLED display panel from Samsung on steroids. It has a 18.5:9 ratio, a claimed peak brightness of up to 1000 nits for HDR, curved edges and curved corners. Thereâs an improved version of Always On Display, which shows not only widgets for date and time, but also music player controls and alarms. It also features colourful backgrounds. Samsungâs new Infinity Wallpapers (a combination of wallpapers for Always On Display, home screen, and lock screen) look great on these displays. The Galaxy S8 comes with a 5.8-inch display, while the larger Galaxy S8+ features a 6.2-inch display. Apart from the display size and pixel density, everything else remains the same among these two smartphones. In my testing, I found the displays to be bright and full of oversaturated colours, making it a delight to read content and view videos. Colour calibration is accurate too, but some units have been facing a red tint issue. I also noticed this issue on a review unit, and Samsung has acknowledged the problem and started rolling out a software update. The update gives you greater control over the colour calibration, and you can tweak the settings to minimize the red tint. Since these displays have an aspect ration of 18.5:9, you are bound to see letter-boxing or pillar-boxing, depending on whether youâre using the phone in landscape or portrait mode. Samsung has tried to solve this issue by offering a zoom-in mode. This feature can be activated by clicking the crop to fit button that appears while youâre watching any video. While this is not the most elegant solution â some portion of the video would be cropped â it is the best option to take full advantage of that gorgeous panel. All-in-all, these are pretty much the best displays you can find on a smartphone today. The Infinity Displays on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ can achieve a peak brightness of up to 1000 nits and cover 113 percent of DCI-P3 colour gamut as well as 142 percent of sRGB colour spaces. Therefore, they have been certified by the UHD Alliance as HDR-compatible displays. Both smartphones have HDR10 and Mobile HDR Premium certifications. The company has inked partnerships with Amazon Prime Video and other video streaming platforms to offer HDR content to the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Netflix and YouTube are yet to rollout HDR support for these smartphones, though, but itâs only a matter of time before these services start offering HDR videos on the phones.  Samsung is shipping its newest version of UX (now called Samsung Experience 8.0) with the Galaxy S8 and S8+, with the skin built on top of Android 7.0 Nougat. This version of TouchWiz has several new features than the one on the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. It also features an overhauled app drawer and a home screen setup. The whole user experience feels quite modern, more so than the stock Android user experience. A few aspects of the UI â app launcher and fingerprint reader gestures â have been inspired by the Pixel and the Pixel XL. Thereâs no dedicated button to open the app drawer now. All you have to do is swipe up or down on the home screen to show all the app icons. Since itâs hard to reach the notifications area due to the unusually long screen of the S8 and S8+, thereâs an option which you can activate to use the swipe down gesture on the fingerprint reader to bring down the notification shade â similar to what youâd do on the Google Pixel. However, the problem here is that the fingerprint reader is located high up on the phone, which is harder to locate when compared to the fingerprint reader on the Pixel (which is at the centre of its back). Samsung should have had used the home screen swipe down gesture to access notifications, which wouldâve made the gesture easier to use. Quick setting toggles can be arranged according to your liking using the Button Order option. You can even choose how many toggles appear in one go by changing the Button Grid option. By default, the screen brightness slider doesnât appear when you swipe down the notifications shade the first time (you have to swipe down twice to see it). However, you can set it to appear on the first time by clicking the down arrow button beside the brightness slide and activating the âshow control on topâ option. Samsung was the first to offer side-by-side multitasking over three years ago, and with the feature now integrated into Android 7.0 Nougat, the manufacturer is making a few additions. Tapping the multitasking button reveals all the apps that are open, and you can not only run two apps side by side, but also choose to show a particular part of an app. This is useful when you want to focus only on one area/part of an app while using two apps simultaneously. If you want to switch the location of two active apps in side-by-side multitasking, you can do that too. As always, apps can be used in a small window hovering over whatever screen youâre on. Samsung introduced themes for Galaxy smartphones starting with the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. Thereâs a dedicated Theme Store where you can find official themes from Samsung as well as third-party themes from other developers. There are a few brilliant themes in there, and if youâre one for stock Android UI, you can download plenty of third-party themes that can make your Galaxy S8 or S8+âs UI like that of the Pixel. Theme packs include custom wallpapers, backgrounds, AoD widgets and backgrounds, icons, dialer design, and more. Some new themes also include Infinity Wallpapers for that stunning screen. SideSync from Samsung is one of the most downplayed features on Galaxy smartphones and tablets. The feature essentially lets you mirror the smartphone screen on your desktop and control it using your PCâs keyboard and mouse. It can be used to drag and drop files from PC to smartphone and vice versa. It can also keep your PCâs and smartphoneâs clipboard in sync. You can even see your smartphone notifications on a connected PC and reply to them without leaving your computer. The Smart Switch app that comes pre-installed on most Samsung phones these days allows quick transfer of data from an old phone to a new one. It can be done wirelessly over Wi-Fi or through a wired connection using a compatible USB cable. Data includes images, videos, documents, alarms, contacts, calendar entries, apps, games, wallpapers, and more. Pretty much everything can be transferred from an old phone to the Galaxy S8 and S8+ quickly â and it supports both Android devices and iPhones. However, note that your iPhone needs to be unencrypted in order to transfer the data. Secure Folder is an improvement over last yearâs Private Mode and KNOX features. Itâs a place where you can save confidential information â including apps, images, videos, documents, files, and more. You can move images and videos from the gallery to Secure Folder. This folder can be opened by your registered fingerprints, iris, or a pin code. It is secured by Samsungâs KNOX security suite, which is claimed to offer defense-grade security mechanism. Moreover, it can also be used for dual apps functionality, so you can use it for dual WhatsApp if youâre using two SIM cards at once.  Bixby is Samsungâs take on an AI-powered digital voice assistant. Apart from showing useful information cards from stock and third-party apps like Facebook, Twitter, and Uber, it can recognise a userâs voice and act on voice commands. Samsung claims that Bixby Voice (Bixbyâs voice assistant) can be asked to perform any task using voice that a user can otherwise perform by touching the smartphoneâs display. For example, you can ask Bixby to find all the images of food that you took on a particular day and email it to your family members. This is just one example, and you perform almost any task on your smartphone just through voice commands. However, it is launched only in South Korea as of now, and weâre not sure if it will hit the Indian market this year. Moreover, Bixby Now (the feature that shows information cards) can show information from only a handful of partner apps, so itâs kind of useless as of now. Overall, thereâs not much that Bixby can offer to Galaxy S8 and S8+ users in India. The service is still in its infancy, but it has the potential to become something great. Until then, however, best disable it.  The Galaxy S8 and S8+ feature 12-megapixel rear-facing cameras with F1.7 aperture, OIS, and 4K video recording. It might sound similar to last yearâs Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, but time around, Samsung used a slightly newer camera sensor (Sony IMX320 or Samsung LSI S5K3H1). We will get into how it helps the Galaxy S8 take more accurate images shortly. The phones can also record optically and digitally stabilized 4K videos or 240fps slow-motion videos. There are a lot of other software features, but letâs first focus on the UI of the camera app. Itâs quite simple to begin with. Thereâs a still image shutter button and a video record button. There are shortcuts to adjust flash, HDR, front or rear-facing camera toggle, stickers (Snapchat style), and skin tone (also called as air brushing). Thereâs a shortcut to the gallery app as well. You can drag the shutter button up or down to zoom in or out (digitally, of course). All the other settings like image and video resolutions, tracking autofocus, shape correction, shooting methods, stabilisation, and storage location are hidden in the appâs settings menu.  Thanks to the newer sensor and a more capable ISP used in the newer Exynos 8895 chipset, Samsung has been able to employ a better image processing algorithm âÂ Multi Frame Processing â to offer better quality stills. Samsung says that Multi Frame Processing consists of capturing three images every time the shutter button is clicked. These images are then used to output one still image that has better dynamic range, colours, and sharpness. Thanks to more processing bandwidth, Samsung was able to digitally stabilise 4K videos, something that wasnât available in the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. [masterslider id=”6″] The quality of the images captured using the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is one of the best in the world right now (in the smartphone category, of course). Still images come out sharp, and with plenty of details. Dynamic range is pretty wide, but still not as good as the Google Pixel (which uses HDR+ algorithm to stitch nine images into one final image with exceptionally wide dynamic range). These phones tend to oversaturate colours sometimes, but most people like it that way. If you donât want artificial changes, you can use the Pro Mode in the camera app to adjust the final results. Thereâs Auto Live HDR that showcases how the final image would look like even before the shutter button is clicked.  4K videos recorded using the S8 and S8+ have plenty of detail, and the audio quality is really good, thanks to higher bitrate audio capture. OIS and EIS work in tandem, so you get pretty smooth videos. However, if youâre jogging or walking fast while recording a video, you can notice a jello effect in the corners. The front-facing camera can record QHD videos, but thereâs no OIS, and EIS isnât activated as well. So, if youâre planning to capture a video using the front-facing camera while walking fast, make sure you stick to 1080p. Thanks to the fast Dual Pixel phase-detection autofocus mechanism in the camera, thereâs no focus hunting. Even the focus transition is extremely smooth, so videos look like theyâve been captured by professionals. The front-facing 8MP camera (with F1.7 aperture) on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ features autofocus mechanism, a first in a Samsung smartphone. This greatly improves the quality of self portraits (or selfies as we call them these days). Images come out sharp with much more details than what Iâve seen on the S7 and S7 edge. However, Iâve noticed that sometimes the camera adjusts the focus point just before you hit the shutter button, which results in blurred images. This is nitpicking though. The selfie camera has a wide-angle lens, and you can fit in a lot of people (or background) in the frame. Moreover, autofocus helps a lot in video calls as well. All in all, itâs a great front-facing camera, and there are not a lot of phones that have better front-facing cameras than the S8 and S8+.  The Galaxy S8 and S8+ come equipped with the Exynos 8895 octa-core processor, 4GB RAM, 64GB of internal storage, and a hybrid dual-SIM card, meaning you can use the SIM 2 slot for storage expansion via a microSD card. The Exynos 8895 rivals the Snapdragon 835 from Qualcomm and the Kirin 960 from Huawei in terms of features and performance. It is built using Samsungâs 10nm FinFET LPP process, uses ARMâs powerful Mali-G71MP20 GPU, and comes with an integrated gigabit LTE mode. Ideally, this beastly chip should be able to make any smartphone very, very fast. However, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ arenât as smooth as I hoped. Yes, they run through everyday tasks without breaking a sweat, but the UI itself isnât as fluid as that on the iPhone or the Pixel. I was able to notice a few stutters here and there, especially when the phones connect to a new internet connection. Samsung has made great improvements in UI design, but it is still unable to offer a UI that consistently hits the 60fps frame rate. I donât know why it is so hard for Samsung to develop a UI that is as smooth as the one on iPhone or Pixel. No matter how fast the underlying chipset is in a Galaxy smartphone, it is never as smooth as competing phones from Apple, Google, OnePlus, or even Xiaomi. Maybe Samsung is using a different benchmark to measure performance, but in my view, the chipset that should be the fastest in the world isnât working up to its potential in the Galaxy S8 and S8+ because of Samsungâs inability to optimize its skin. When it comes to multitasking though, 4GB of fast LPDDR4 RAM in the S8 and S8+ works well. I never noticed any app getting closed due to too many apps being stored in the memory. As opposed to what many other brands might say, I think that 4GB of RAM is enough in this day and age, especially when Android has become so intelligent in app management. Android O is expected to make it even better, all thanks to improved restrictions on background tasks. Gaming is very smooth, all thanks to the Mali G71MP20 GPU, which is slightly faster than the Adrneo 540 chipset used in the Snapdragon 835. For the first time ever, Samsungâs Exynos chipset is able to outperform Qualcommâs comparable Snapdragon solution when it comes to graphics crunching abilities. All the games that I tried â Asphalt 8, GTA IV, Modern Combat 5, and Real Racing 3 â worked flawlessly, at least as long as youâre operating the phone in normal environmental temperatures. There was one instance when I was out in the open, under harsh sunlight (and Indiaâs summers can be quite brutal), and the Galaxy S8 heated up considerably. The chipset throttled, and as a result, the phoneâs UI was stuttering a lot. This goes on to show that even the most powerful smartphones can experience stutters when pushed to their limits. Thankfully, this was only a one-off experience, and not a daily occurance. The 64GB UFS2.1 storage chip used in these phones is fast, but in day-to-day performance, you will not see a difference compared to UFS 2.0 chips used in the Galaxy S6 or S7. These chips are still not as fast as NVMe storage chips used in the latest iPhones, though. If you plan to store all your images, videos, and multimedia data on a microSD card, make sure that you buy at least a UHS-1 class card. The fingerprint reader on the back of the phones seems slower and less accurate than the ones I am accustomed to even in the entry-level phones like the Redmi 3s Prime. I noticed that it denied authentication my fingerprints if I didnât cover the complete surface area.  On the other side, the iris scanner is amazing. Google hasnât built a centralized API for an iris scanner, so it wonât be able to replace the fingerprint reader in apps where you are supposed to authenticate using fingerprints. If your bankâs app or a password manager allows you to use fingerprints as an authentication system, you wonât be able to replace it with your iris yet. I hope Google includes iris scanning mechanism in the Nexus Imprint API with the final release of Android O. The loudspeaker on the S8 and S8+ is louder than their predecessors, but it still falls short. I was hoping that Samsung would use AKGâs audio expertise in the Galaxy S8âs loudspeaker to include a stereo setup, but it didnât. Hopefully, that will be amended later this year with the Galaxy Note 8. If Apple can offer a powerful stereo loudspeaker experience on its new iPhones, while still being IP67-certified, why canât Samsung? In comparison, loudspeaker setups on the latest iPhones and the HTC U Ultra have been pretty impressive.  The cellular signal reception is quite good, thanks to the glass-covered body. Unless you cover the whole device with both your palms, you should be able to get good quality signal. Moreover, the earpiece is very clear and loud, and the noise cancellation works well. I used the phones for three weeks on Airtelâs 4G LTE service in Hyderabad, India. Wi-Fi reception was great too, thanks to 4×4 MUMO dual-band Wi-Fi ac. Bluetooth 5.0âs hugely improved bandwidth allowed Samsung to employ a feature wherein you can connect two Bluetooth wireless headphones or speakers to the Galaxy S8 (or the S8+) at the same time, allowing you to stream wireless audio on both the connected devices at once. It isnât perfect though, as you can see a delay between both streams. The phones are also compatible with Google Cast and Samsung Connect. If you own a Google Cast compatible device like Chromecast, Chromecast Audio, or a Mi TV Box, youâll be able to stream content from your phone to your TV or speakers over Wi-Fi. Samsung Connect only works with Samsungâs audio-video products, though, so unless your home is filled with compatible Samsung products, I doubt youâll ever use it. The S8 and S8+ offer a 3.5mm headphone jack, so you can use any standard headphone that you like. Samsung is going out of the way to offer AKG-tuned in-ear canal earphones with every Galaxy S8 and S8+. The wires are braided and tangle-resistant, so itâs easier to carry it with you. Moreover, they also come with in-line microphone and audio controls. These are, by far, the best bundled earphones that Iâve ever used. They not only fit effortlessly and comfortable, but also sound very good. You might argue that you can get much better-sounding pair of buds for $99. However, for most consumers, theyâre much better than what theyâre normally used to.  Samsung Pay is one of the most important features on Samsung smartphones these days. Itâs the companyâs mobile payments solution thatâs being included in higher mid-range and high-end Galaxy smartphones. It uses a combination of MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) and NFC features to let you pay at stores and outlets without a need for an actual credit or debit card. The MST feature in the Galaxy S8 and S8+ (and some other Samsung smartphones and smartwatches) mimics a card swipe, so the PoS (Point of Sale) terminal is forced into thinking that a card has been swiped. You just need to register all your credit, debit, and loyalty cards into the Samsung Pay app once. Donât worry, all your card and financial data is kept secured using the KNOX security suite and your fingerprints. Samsung has partnered with the following banks for the Indian market: American Express, Axis Bank, Citibank, HDFC, ICICI, SBI, and Standard Chartered. More banks and financial institutions will join Samsung Pay in the future. I tried it at different stores, and since it was the first time merchants saw, they first said that it wonât work on their terminals, but then they were amazed once it worked. Samsung Pay is a real life-saver in an event where you forget your wallet at your home. However, it wonât work in case you are converting a transaction into an EMI. That type of transaction requires a chip & PIN authentication. Samsung has also partnered with a bunch of brands to offer your discounts and cashbacks if you use Samsung Pay.  Similar to the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge, Samsung continued with 3,000mAh and 3,500mAh batteries in the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+ respectively. When you look at the screen size to battery capacity ratio of these devices, it would appear that they donât have nearly enough to offer satisfactory battery life. However, they can generally last throughout the day, especially the Galaxy S8+. They also feature rapid charging abilities (both wired and wireless), so you can top up the batteries in a short time, in case they die before the end of the day. Thanks to the frugal 10nm Exynos 8895 processor, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ donât consumer as much power as their predecessors. These phones lose very little battery charge in sleep mode. Samsung has also used a dedicated IC for the AoD mode in both these phones to minimize power drain. However, you would be better off without activating the AoD mode in the Galaxy S8 because it has a smaller capacity battery. Even though Samsung set the default screen resolution to FHD+ (2200 x 1080 pixels), I didnât notice much of a difference in battery life when set to the highest possible resolution: QHD+ (2960 x 1440 pixels). In my usage, which includes four emails accounts on sync, half a dozen IM apps, a dozen media streaming apps, and all the popular social networking apps, the Galaxy S8+ offered satisfactory battery life with almost all the important features enabled. The Galaxy S8 isnât as good as the Galaxy S8+ for some reason. The Galaxy S8 usually lasted around 16-18 hours with 3-3.5 hours of screen-on time, while the Galaxy S8+ usually lasted around 20-24 hours with a screen-on time of anywhere between 3.5-4.5 hours. If you want to go with the Galaxy S8 because of its compact size, be sure to disable AoD and a few other features. Samsung also claims that its new batteries, which pass through the 8-point safety check, can retain up to 95 percent of charge capacity even after one year of normal usage. Thatâs up from just 80 percent charge capacity of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge. This means that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ should be able to offer almost similar battery life after one year of usage as it used to when using a brand new device.  Weâre yet to review the LG G6, but we already know that itâs not as feature rich as the Galaxy S8 and S8+. Moreover, HTC and Apple are yet to announce their flagship smartphones for 2017. So, is the Galaxy S8 the best Android smartphone of the year? Well, we canât say for sure since there are a few other devices â HTC U 11, LG G6, Mi 6, OnePlus 5, and the Sony Xperia XZ Premium â that we need to review. However, what we can say for sure is that the Galaxy S8 and the S8+ are one of the most impressive smartphones that weâve tested so far. They feature brilliant screens, excellent processors, fast and reliable cameras, decent battery life, and the impressive Samsung Pay. Of course, Samsung couldâve made them even better if it had used a better fingerprint sensor, stereo speakers, and slightly larger capacity batteries, but as a package, theyâre the best phones in the market today.

2238,32,/gear/2018/04/07/samsung-galaxy-s9-review/,0,0,2018-04-07,samsung-galaxy-s9-review, Asif Iqbal Shaik ," Samsung Galaxy S9+ Review: Improved, But Not A Big Upgrade Over The S8+",https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/2018/04/07/samsung-galaxy-s9-review/," Hot on the heels of success it found with the Galaxy S8 duo (review) and then the Galaxy Note 8 (review), Samsung launched the Galaxy S9 and the Galaxy S9+ just ahead of the Mobile World Congress 2018 that happened in February in Barcelona, Spain. The phones claim to offer upgrades in processing speed, camera, and audio. The phone was launched in India last month. The new Exynos processor is claimed to be the fastest in the Android segment, while the new dual-camera setup with dual-aperture claims to offer impressive images in low-light conditions. Thanks to the added processing power, the phone can now record 4K videos in 60fps and 720p slow-motion videos at a whopping 960fps. It’s also the first Galaxy S series smartphone to feature stereo loudspeakers. We’ve managed to put all these upgrades to test to see whether they help the Galaxy S9+ in ending past its competitors, and here’s our in-depth review of the device after using it for four weeks. Samsung has put up good amount of effort in designing the Galaxy S9+ box. It is black-coloured box with the S9+ branding in shiny blue colour. The exterior cover also mentions the phone’s full name in a smaller font and the storage capacity on the front, colour variant on its side, and specifications/features on the rear. After you slide open the cover, you’re presented with a box which can be opened from the right side by lifting the latch. The first thing you see isn’t the phone, but a smaller box that contains the SIM card removal tool, quick start guide, and a cheap cover for the phone. Underneath that box is the Galaxy S9+. The box also contains the following: Overall, I am quite pleased with what Samsung has done with the packaging and accessories for the Galaxy S9+. Samsung introduced a brand new, bezel-less screen design last year with the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+. The company had finally ditched the physical home button, and was ready to move towards the future of smartphone design, shaming Apple. The design was so good that there was no need to change it this year. The Galaxy S9+’s body uses a high-quality metal (Series 7000 Aluminium) frame that is sandwiched between two Corning Gorilla Glass 5 panels. The glass back also means that the phone is compatible with wireless charging technology. The phone looks impressively sharp and beautiful, and Samsung is offering it in four colours: Black, Coral Blue, Lilac Purple and Titanium Grey (not available in India). Most of its front is occupied by the curved screen, with the earpiece, front-facing camera, and the necessary sensors placed in a thin bezel above the display. The earpiece also acts as one of the loudspeaker in the phone’s stereo setup. More on that later. The right side of the phone has power button, while the volume and a dedicated Bixby button on the left. All the buttons have great tactile feedback. I tried using the phone with the Bixby button enabled for a couple of weeks, but ended up disabling it since I was accidentally pressing it due to its placement just opposite to the power button. Samsung should really allow remapping of the Bixby button to an app or action of a user’s choice if not removing it from its future devices. The rear of the phone has a dual-camera setup, LED flash, heart-rate monitor, and the fingerprint reader. The company isn’t moving away from a dedicated 3.5mm headphone port anytime soon. You can find it at the bottom of the phone along with the primary microphone, main loudspeaker, a USB Type-C port. The top part of the metal frame consists of a hybrid SIM card slot in which the second SIM card slot can be used to expand the storage space using a microSD card. Like most phones these days, the battery is non-removable. The phone is IP68-certified for dust and water resistance, and it offers a sense of relief to use the phone near water such as the beach, pool, or in rain. Most people won’t be able to discern between the Galaxy S8+ and the Galaxy S9+ unless they have a look at the rear design of the phones. Such is the resemblance between the two phones. Samsung did make an improvement where it was needed: the placement of the fingerprint reader. It is now placed below the dual-camera setup, making it much easier to reach compared to the Galaxy S8/S8+. However, it is still grouped with the dual-camera setup, so there’s a slight chance that you can still end up smudging the camera lens. I think that Samsung should’ve offered a circular fingerprint reader and placed it even lower to separate it from the camera setup for a perfect experience. The Galaxy S9+’s design looks downright impressive. The build quality is top notch, and there’s no flex whatsoever. It is symmetrically designed, has minimal bezels around the screen, and there’s no ugly screen notch on the phone. However, due to the glass back, it is quite fragile, and I suggest everyone to use a full-cover case with the Galaxy S9 or the Galaxy S9+, just as I did last year with the Galaxy S8 and S8+ (or for most modern high-end smartphones for that matter).  The 6.2-inch screen on the Galaxy S9+ uses a Super AMOLED panel with QHD+ resolution (2960×1440 pixels). Compared to the screen used on the Galaxy S8+, the new panel can go 100 nits brighter (at a maximum of 700 nits) under direct sunlight. It can go also as high as 1,000 nits, but that’s only when the phone is playing back HDR10 video content. The Always On Mode can be used to display the clock and/or calendar widgets along with notification icons even when the phone is in sleep mode. There’s a pressure-sensitive area where the on-screen home button is displayed. This is similar to Apple’s 3D Touch technology, but limited to a limited area on the screen. Applying some pressure on that area takes you to the home screen no matter which app you’re using or whether the virtual home button is visible or not. It works even when the screen is turned off. The screen is protected by the Gorilla Glass 5 panel, which is resistant to scratches and scuffs, but don’t make a mistake by thinking that it won’t shatter. One fall from shoulder-level height, and the front and/or rear glass panels will most probably shatter. Since it’s an OLED panel, blacks are deep and inky, and the colours pop. By default, the phone comes with the Adaptive Mode, which shows slightly saturated colours and changes screen settings depending on the type of content that’s being displayed on the screen. However, that doesn’t mean the phone can’t show accurate colours. The Basic screen mode shows the most accurate colours, maybe not as accurate as the iPhone X (review), but great enough for most users. There are AMOLED Cinema and AMOLED Photo screen modes as well, which are better while showing movies and images, respectively. I think that the Galaxy S9+ has the best screen in the smartphone segment right now due to accurate colours, practically infinite contrast ratio, great sunlight legibility, and uniform bezels, resulting in immersive viewing experience. Apart from its screen, I was also pretty impressed by the phone’s audio capabilities, thanks to the stereo loudspeaker setup, AKG-tuned in-ear earphones that come bundled with the phone, as well as a dedicated 3.5mm audio port. Yes, it’s such a bad time for audio enthusiasts that the presence of a 3.5mm headphone port on a high-end phone is considered to be a premium feature. The phone can playback Hi-Res audio files. There’s Dolby Audio (Dolby Digital and Dolby Digital Plus), too, and while I wasn’t expecting anything spectacular from it, activating Dolby Audio while listening to audio through loudspeakers widens the sound stage. The primary loudspeaker is at the bottom, while the earpiece doubles up as the secondary loudspeaker. Combined, they offer a stereo loudspeaker setup, offering not only higher volume, but also richer audio. The audio through loudspeakers is impressively loud and immersive (for a smartphone, that is). The volume sits somewhere between the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 8 Plus. The audio through the Galaxy S9+’s loudspeakers is slightly louder than the audio through iPhone 7 Plus’ loudspeakers. However, the iPhone’s loudspeaker offers more bass and depth. The earpiece was also loud and clear during voice calls. The bundled earphones are pretty good, too, featuring dual audio drivers, and in-ear canal type design. I won’t say that they are the best headphones ever bundled with a smartphone, but they’re much nicer audio than whatever trash (read EarPods) Apple bundles with the iPhones. There’s Bluetooth 5.0 for wireless audio, and it supports high-end wireless audio codecs including aptX, aptX HD, and LDAC. While these aren’t mentioned on the official specs sheet, but the phone supports these codecs. Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0’s higher data transmission rate at 2Mbps, Samsung offers a feature called Dual Audio in which two Bluetooth speakers or headphones can stream audio from the phone at the same time. However, expect some lag between the two audio streams. For audio enthusiasts, the Galaxy S9 and the Galaxy S9+ are one of best smartphone solutions as they have a dedicated 3.5mm headphone port, stereo loudspeakers, Hi-Res audio support, high-quality audio codecs, and an impressive audio player app. The Galaxy Note 8 was Samsung’s first high-end phone with a dual-camera setup at the rear, and the Galaxy S9+ is its first Galaxy S-series smartphone with a dual-camera. It uses two 12MP cameras, using either Samsung’s ISOCELL SAK2L3 sensor or the Sony IMX345 sensor. Both sensors are virtually identical, featuring a sensor size of 1/2.55-inch, 1.4µm pixels, dual-pixel phase-detection autofocus, and 26mm lens. The sensor is paired to a dual-aperture lens (ƒ/1.5 and ƒ/2.4). The secondary 12MP sensor is much smaller in comparison (at 1/3.6-inch), and features phase-detection autofocus, 1µm pixels, and a 52mm lens. Both sensors are equipped with optical image stabilisation systems, though, and can record 4K videos at 60fps. There’s an LED flash, too. At the front, there’s an 8MP camera (1/3.6-inch; 1.22µm pixels) with ƒ/1.7 aperture, 25mm wide-angle lens, autofocus, and QHD video recording at 30fps. Samsung’s smartphones offer some of the best cameras, and the Galaxy S9+ is no different. Its imaging capabilities is one of its strongest suites, and the images as well as videos turn out great, no matter the lighting condition. Thanks to dual-pixel autofocus, focussing is instantaneous and reliable. shot-to-shot time is short, too. There’s support for auto HDR, and the camera app also shows live HDR preview. This means that you can be sure how the HDR image will turn out. Images clicked using the Galaxy S9 turn out to be great with enough details, closer-to-accurate colours, and wide dynamic range. Similar to Google’s HDR+ mechanism, Samsung captures 12 frames and merges them into a single image for higher dynamic range and sharper details. When there’s very low light, aperture is set to ƒ/1.5, allowing more light to fall onto the sensor for brighter and relatively noise-free images. However, due to very wide aperture, images are slightly softer, but nothing to worry about. In Pro Mode, you can adjust aperture, exposure, focal length, ISO, metering, shutter speed, and white balance. There’s an option to apply filters, too. There are options to create two filters of choice, in which you can adjust the colour temperature, contrast, highlight, saturation, shadows and tint. There aren’t many smartphones that offer such extensive options in the built-in camera app. Other features include adding Snapchat-style filters and stickers and shape-correction. The selfie mode has a new option called AR Emoji, which tries to create your digital avatar, and it’s pretty terrible. Then there’s an option to capture selfies with background blur, and uses machine learning to spot a person’s face, keep it in focus, and blur the rest of the image. It’s a hit-or-miss affair. The camera also lets you capture wide selfies (think of them are panoramas through the front-facing camera to capture more of the scene in one image). Selfies come out sharper, but the phone has a tendency to soften the skin even with the beauty mode turned off. The Live Focus mode is what you can use to click images with background blur using the rear dual-camera setup. Both, 26mm and 52mm cameras are used to click such images, and a great thing about the Galaxy S9+’s Live Focus mode is that the amount of background blur can be adjusted even after an image is captured. This is not possible with the dual-camera iPhones. The phone can also capture hyper-lapse and slow-motion videos. The Super Slo Mo video mode can capture 720p videos at a whopping 960fps. However, that’s not something totally new. High-end Sony phones had this feature since 2017. Newer Sony phones like the XZ2 and the XZ2 Compact can capture 1080p videos at 960fps. To achieve this, the camera sensors are equipped with 1GB of RAM to store 0.2 second 720p video recorded at 960fps, which is then stretched to a 6-second slow-motion video played back at 30fps. Thanks to the faster processor and a much powerful image signal processor (ISP), the Galaxy S9 and S9+ are able to record 4K videos at buttery-smooth 60fps, something that only the newest iPhones were capable of until recently. 9MP images can be captured while recording videos. The quality of the videos is top-notch, thanks to higher bit-rate and frame rate. However, 4K 60fps videos recorded during low-light conditions come out noisier compared to 4K 60fps videos recording using the iPhone X and the iPhone 8, 8 Plus. Exposure transition is smoother than the iPhones, though. Audio in the videos is much clearer as well. Overall, the Galaxy S9+’s camera captures bright and clear images as well as sharp and smooth videos, probably the best in the business right now. The phone runs Android 8.0 Oreo-based Samsung Experience 9.5, and supports Project Treble, as most phones released with Oreo do. It supports App Shortcuts as well. However, it doesn’t support an Android feature called ‘Seamless Updates’, which basically creates two partitions in the phone’s storage. When a new Android update arrives, it gets installed in the background on the partition which isn’t currently being used. The next time the phone restarts, it uses the partition with the latest software update, and the user doesn’t have to wait for the update to be installed. It was first implemented in the first-generation Pixel phones by Google. The Galaxy S9+’s user interface design is almost similar to the one on the Galaxy S8 and S8+. It has a futuristic design, thanks to slick icons and Infinity Wallpapers. There are dozens of useful features on the phone, and some of them are listed below: Sadly, Bixby (Tips & Tricks) isn’t one of those features that I find useful. Sure, it has some things going for it (especially deep integration with stock and even some third-party apps), which makes it unique compared to its competitors Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. However, its language recognition is not as good as its competition, and most of times, it’s faster to just use your fingers to get things done. I personally don’t prefer using voice commands for getting tasks done, unless when I can’t use my fingers. However, if you’re someone who enjoys getting things done through digital voice assistants, you may like Bixby. Bixby Home is pretty useless, though, and so is Bixby Vision. I think that some stock apps on the phone are much better than Google’s apps or stock Android apps. For instance, the Samsung Internet web browser is much smoother than Google Chrome, and offers more features, including extensions like advertisement removal tools and sports score tickers. Calendar, Gallery, Music Player, and Video Player apps are better than what Google offers as a part of stock Android. The slightly renewed camera app appears bloated now, though. Earlier versions of the app were cleaner to look at and easier to use as well. Indian units of the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ come equipped with the company’s own Exynos 9810 processor. It uses a 64-bit octa-core CPU, consisting of four Exynos M3 cores with a maximum clock speed of 2.7GHz and four Cortex-A55 cores with a maximum clock speed of 1.8GHz. There’s Mali-G72 MP18 GPU. The new Exynos SoC is made using Samsung’s second-generation 10nm FinFET LPP fabrication process. It is physically larger than both the Snapdragon 845 and the Apple A11 Bionic because it has wider pipelines. Unit sold in China and the US use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC. The Galaxy S9+ comes with 6GB of LP-DDR4X RAM and 64GB/128GB/256GB of UFS 2.1 internal storage. Storage space can be expanded using a microSD card (up to 400GB). It is a widely-accepted fact that Apple’s chipsets offer much faster single-core performance compared to processors used in Android smartphones. However, the phone scored 3,641 points in Geekbench’s single-core test, beating every other Android smartphone out there. The single-core score is close to the single-core score of the A10 Fusion chipset used in the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. So, I expected the Galaxy S9+ to perform much smoother than competing Android smartphones. However, I was disappointed by the phone’s performance. I noticed that the high single-core and multi-core score did not convert into smooth real-life performance. I came across stutters and lag every now and then while reviewing the phone over the course of three weeks. Performance inside Google apps was particularly bad, a classic Samsung problem. Even though the Exynos 9810 is physically bigger and the CPU has wider pipelines, it didn’t perform better than even last year’s Exynos 8895, and I think that it is due to the lack of proper software optimisation. I waited till the first software update was released to see if the performance improves, but it didn’t. In comparison, the OnePlus 5T and the Google Pixel 2 phones perform much smoother than the Galaxy S9+, which is a shame since the both phones are priced lower. All the new iPhones are considerably faster in day-to-day usage. The signal reception was pretty great, though, something that I always experience with Samsung phones. The phone features GPS, A-GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac with MU-MIMO, Wi-Fi Direct, Google Cast, Miracast, Bluetooth 5.0, NFC, USB 3.1 Type-C port, and a 3.5mm audio port. The Galaxy S9+’s fingerprint reader is much faster than the one used on the Galaxy S8, S8+, and the Galaxy Note 8. Moreover, registering a fingerprint is much easier as well. All you have to do during the process is swipe the finger across the reader once. The iris scanner seems faster, too. Moreover, Samsung has also implemented Face Unlock and Smart Unlock in its latest flagship smartphone. Face Unlock is nowhere near as fast as the OnePlus 5T’s Face Unlock feature. Smart Unlock, which checks both face and iris, offers more convenience. It comes in handy when you can’t reach the fingerprint reader or when the finger is sweaty or wet. The newer heart rate monitor can also record blood pressure, a first in any phone that I’ve ever used. Kudos to Samsung for that!  Performance is not the only area where I was let down by the Galaxy S9+. The phone’s battery life left a lot to be desired. Although it has the same battery capacity (3500mAh) as that of the Galaxy S8+, I experienced shorter battery life. After a full charge (which takes about 100 minutes through a wired Fast Adaptive Charger), the phone lasted anywhere between 18-24 hours with a screen-on time of 3.5-4.5 hours. These figures were achieved by turning off the Always On Display mode. If you live in an area where there’s lot of sunlight, and you spend a lot of time outdoors, or if you use the AoD mode, expect the battery life to be even shorter. All the newer iPhones last longer than the Galaxy S9+, and so do the Google Pixel 2 XL (review), OnePlus 5T (review) and the Mi MIX 2 (review). In comparison, the OnePlus 5T offers a screen-on time of greater than 6 hours, while the Pixel 2 XL and the Mi MIX 2 offer more than 24-hours long battery life with screen-on time figures of 5 hours or longer. The iPhone X’s battery life is close to that of the Pixel 2 XL, while iPhone 8 Plus lasts slightly longer than the OnePlus 5T on a single full charge. The Galaxy S9+ is also compatible with Qi and PMA wireless chargers, and even fast wireless charging (7.5W), which I tested with Samsung’s Fast Wireless Chargers from 2016 and 2017.  The Samsung Galaxy S9+ is a near perfect Android smartphone. It looks sexy and is built quite well. The Galaxy S9+ has a one of the best screens in the market right now and arguably the best bezel-less design of 2018, devoid of the ugly screen notches we’ve come to see of late. It has loud, clear, and punchy dual stereo loudspeakers, plenty of useful software features and customisability, and Samsung Pay. The phone’s biggest upgrade is its imaging. It can capture bright and sharp images with close-to-accurate colours. It can also record 4K videos at 60fps, a first for any Android smartphone. However, the phone leaves a lot to be desired in real-world performance. The Exynos 9810’s chart-breaking single-core performance doesn’t convert into faster real-world performance. The UI stutters and the phone lags here and there. It’s not as smooth as relatively cheaper-priced phones like the OnePlus 5T or the Pixel 2 XL. AR Emojis and Super Slo Mo videos are gimmicks at best, and the battery life is shorter than even its predecessor. On top of that, you have to pay a hefty price for the phone. If you’re using any high-end phone from last year, the Galaxy S9+ won’t be a huge upgrade. Save your money for the Galaxy Note 9, iPhone X, or the next-generation Pixel phone. The Galaxy S9+ isn’t worth the money right now."

The phone looks impressively sharp and beautiful, and Samsung is offering it in four colours: Black, Coral Blue, Lilac Purple and Titanium Grey (not available in India). Most of its front is occupied by the curved screen, with the earpiece, front-facing camera, and the necessary sensors placed in a thin bezel above the display. The earpiece also acts as one of the loudspeaker in the phone’s stereo setup. More on that later. The right side of the phone has power button, while the volume and a dedicated Bixby button on the left. All the buttons have great tactile feedback. I tried using the phone with the Bixby button enabled for a couple of weeks, but ended up disabling it since I was accidentally pressing it due to its placement just opposite to the power button. Samsung should really allow remapping of the Bixby button to an app or action of a user’s choice if not removing it from its future devices. The rear of the phone has a dual-camera setup, LED flash, heart-rate monitor, and the fingerprint reader. The company isn’t moving away from a dedicated 3.5mm headphone port anytime soon. You can find it at the bottom of the phone along with the primary microphone, main loudspeaker, a USB Type-C port. The top part of the metal frame consists of a hybrid SIM card slot in which the second SIM card slot can be used to expand the storage space using a microSD card. Like most phones these days, the battery is non-removable. The phone is IP68-certified for dust and water resistance, and it offers a sense of relief to use the phone near water such as the beach, pool, or in rain. Most people won’t be able to discern between the Galaxy S8+ and the Galaxy S9+ unless they have a look at the rear design of the phones. Such is the resemblance between the two phones. Samsung did make an improvement where it was needed: the placement of the fingerprint reader. It is now placed below the dual-camera setup, making it much easier to reach compared to the Galaxy S8/S8+. However, it is still grouped with the dual-camera setup, so there’s a slight chance that you can still end up smudging the camera lens. I think that Samsung should’ve offered a circular fingerprint reader and placed it even lower to separate it from the camera setup for a perfect experience. The Galaxy S9+’s design looks downright impressive. The build quality is top notch, and there’s no flex whatsoever. It is symmetrically designed, has minimal bezels around the screen, and there’s no ugly screen notch on the phone. However, due to the glass back, it is quite fragile, and I suggest everyone to use a full-cover case with the Galaxy S9 or the Galaxy S9+, just as I did last year with the Galaxy S8 and S8+ (or for most modern high-end smartphones for that matter).  The 6.2-inch screen on the Galaxy S9+ uses a Super AMOLED panel with QHD+ resolution (2960×1440 pixels). Compared to the screen used on the Galaxy S8+, the new panel can go 100 nits brighter (at a maximum of 700 nits) under direct sunlight. It can go also as high as 1,000 nits, but that’s only when the phone is playing back HDR10 video content. The Always On Mode can be used to display the clock and/or calendar widgets along with notification icons even when the phone is in sleep mode. There’s a pressure-sensitive area where the on-screen home button is displayed. This is similar to Apple’s 3D Touch technology, but limited to a limited area on the screen. Applying some pressure on that area takes you to the home screen no matter which app you’re using or whether the virtual home button is visible or not. It works even when the screen is turned off. The screen is protected by the Gorilla Glass 5 panel, which is resistant to scratches and scuffs, but don’t make a mistake by thinking that it won’t shatter. One fall from shoulder-level height, and the front and/or rear glass panels will most probably shatter. Since it’s an OLED panel, blacks are deep and inky, and the colours pop. By default, the phone comes with the Adaptive Mode, which shows slightly saturated colours and changes screen settings depending on the type of content that’s being displayed on the screen. However, that doesn’t mean the phone can’t show accurate colours. The Basic screen mode shows the most accurate colours, maybe not as accurate as the iPhone X (review), but great enough for most users. There are AMOLED Cinema and AMOLED Photo screen modes as well, which are better while showing movies and images, respectively. I think that the Galaxy S9+ has the best screen in the smartphone segment right now due to accurate colours, practically infinite contrast ratio, great sunlight legibility, and uniform bezels, resulting in immersive viewing experience. Apart from its screen, I was also pretty impressed by the phone’s audio capabilities, thanks to the stereo loudspeaker setup, AKG-tuned in-ear earphones that come bundled with the phone, as well as a dedicated 3.5mm audio port. Yes, it’s such a bad time for audio enthusiasts that the presence of a 3.5mm headphone port on a high-end phone is considered to be a premium feature. The phone can playback Hi-Res audio files. There’s Dolby Audio (Dolby Digital and Dolby Digital Plus), too, and while I wasn’t expecting anything spectacular from it, activating Dolby Audio while listening to audio through loudspeakers widens the sound stage. The primary loudspeaker is at the bottom, while the earpiece doubles up as the secondary loudspeaker. Combined, they offer a stereo loudspeaker setup, offering not only higher volume, but also richer audio. The audio through loudspeakers is impressively loud and immersive (for a smartphone, that is). The volume sits somewhere between the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPhone 8 Plus. The audio through the Galaxy S9+’s loudspeakers is slightly louder than the audio through iPhone 7 Plus’ loudspeakers. However, the iPhone’s loudspeaker offers more bass and depth. The earpiece was also loud and clear during voice calls. The bundled earphones are pretty good, too, featuring dual audio drivers, and in-ear canal type design. I won’t say that they are the best headphones ever bundled with a smartphone, but they’re much nicer audio than whatever trash (read EarPods) Apple bundles with the iPhones. There’s Bluetooth 5.0 for wireless audio, and it supports high-end wireless audio codecs including aptX, aptX HD, and LDAC. While these aren’t mentioned on the official specs sheet, but the phone supports these codecs. Thanks to Bluetooth 5.0’s higher data transmission rate at 2Mbps, Samsung offers a feature called Dual Audio in which two Bluetooth speakers or headphones can stream audio from the phone at the same time. However, expect some lag between the two audio streams. For audio enthusiasts, the Galaxy S9 and the Galaxy S9+ are one of best smartphone solutions as they have a dedicated 3.5mm headphone port, stereo loudspeakers, Hi-Res audio support, high-quality audio codecs, and an impressive audio player app. The Galaxy Note 8 was Samsung’s first high-end phone with a dual-camera setup at the rear, and the Galaxy S9+ is its first Galaxy S-series smartphone with a dual-camera. It uses two 12MP cameras, using either Samsung’s ISOCELL SAK2L3 sensor or the Sony IMX345 sensor. Both sensors are virtually identical, featuring a sensor size of 1/2.55-inch, 1.4µm pixels, dual-pixel phase-detection autofocus, and 26mm lens. The sensor is paired to a dual-aperture lens (ƒ/1.5 and ƒ/2.4). The secondary 12MP sensor is much smaller in comparison (at 1/3.6-inch), and features phase-detection autofocus, 1µm pixels, and a 52mm lens. Both sensors are equipped with optical image stabilisation systems, though, and can record 4K videos at 60fps. There’s an LED flash, too. At the front, there’s an 8MP camera (1/3.6-inch; 1.22µm pixels) with ƒ/1.7 aperture, 25mm wide-angle lens, autofocus, and QHD video recording at 30fps. Samsung’s smartphones offer some of the best cameras, and the Galaxy S9+ is no different. Its imaging capabilities is one of its strongest suites, and the images as well as videos turn out great, no matter the lighting condition. Thanks to dual-pixel autofocus, focussing is instantaneous and reliable. shot-to-shot time is short, too. There’s support for auto HDR, and the camera app also shows live HDR preview. This means that you can be sure how the HDR image will turn out. Images clicked using the Galaxy S9 turn out to be great with enough details, closer-to-accurate colours, and wide dynamic range. Similar to Google’s HDR+ mechanism, Samsung captures 12 frames and merges them into a single image for higher dynamic range and sharper details. When there’s very low light, aperture is set to ƒ/1.5, allowing more light to fall onto the sensor for brighter and relatively noise-free images. However, due to very wide aperture, images are slightly softer, but nothing to worry about. In Pro Mode, you can adjust aperture, exposure, focal length, ISO, metering, shutter speed, and white balance. There’s an option to apply filters, too. There are options to create two filters of choice, in which you can adjust the colour temperature, contrast, highlight, saturation, shadows and tint. There aren’t many smartphones that offer such extensive options in the built-in camera app. Other features include adding Snapchat-style filters and stickers and shape-correction. The selfie mode has a new option called AR Emoji, which tries to create your digital avatar, and it’s pretty terrible. Then there’s an option to capture selfies with background blur, and uses machine learning to spot a person’s face, keep it in focus, and blur the rest of the image. It’s a hit-or-miss affair. The camera also lets you capture wide selfies (think of them are panoramas through the front-facing camera to capture more of the scene in one image). Selfies come out sharper, but the phone has a tendency to soften the skin even with the beauty mode turned off. The Live Focus mode is what you can use to click images with background blur using the rear dual-camera setup. Both, 26mm and 52mm cameras are used to click such images, and a great thing about the Galaxy S9+’s Live Focus mode is that the amount of background blur can be adjusted even after an image is captured. This is not possible with the dual-camera iPhones. The phone can also capture hyper-lapse and slow-motion videos. The Super Slo Mo video mode can capture 720p videos at a whopping 960fps. However, that’s not something totally new. High-end Sony phones had this feature since 2017. Newer Sony phones like the XZ2 and the XZ2 Compact can capture 1080p videos at 960fps. To achieve this, the camera sensors are equipped with 1GB of RAM to store 0.2 second 720p video recorded at 960fps, which is then stretched to a 6-second slow-motion video played back at 30fps. Thanks to the faster processor and a much powerful image signal processor (ISP), the Galaxy S9 and S9+ are able to record 4K videos at buttery-smooth 60fps, something that only the newest iPhones were capable of until recently. 9MP images can be captured while recording videos. The quality of the videos is top-notch, thanks to higher bit-rate and frame rate. However, 4K 60fps videos recorded during low-light conditions come out noisier compared to 4K 60fps videos recording using the iPhone X and the iPhone 8, 8 Plus. Exposure transition is smoother than the iPhones, though. Audio in the videos is much clearer as well. Overall, the Galaxy S9+’s camera captures bright and clear images as well as sharp and smooth videos, probably the best in the business right now. The phone runs Android 8.0 Oreo-based Samsung Experience 9.5, and supports Project Treble, as most phones released with Oreo do. It supports App Shortcuts as well. However, it doesn’t support an Android feature called ‘Seamless Updates’, which basically creates two partitions in the phone’s storage. When a new Android update arrives, it gets installed in the background on the partition which isn’t currently being used. The next time the phone restarts, it uses the partition with the latest software update, and the user doesn’t have to wait for the update to be installed. It was first implemented in the first-generation Pixel phones by Google. The Galaxy S9+’s user interface design is almost similar to the one on the Galaxy S8 and S8+. It has a futuristic design, thanks to slick icons and Infinity Wallpapers. There are dozens of useful features on the phone, and some of them are listed below: Sadly, Bixby (Tips & Tricks) isn’t one of those features that I find useful. Sure, it has some things going for it (especially deep integration with stock and even some third-party apps), which makes it unique compared to its competitors Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. However, its language recognition is not as good as its competition, and most of times, it’s faster to just use your fingers to get things done. I personally don’t prefer using voice commands for getting tasks done, unless when I can’t use my fingers. However, if you’re someone who enjoys getting things done through digital voice assistants, you may like Bixby. Bixby Home is pretty useless, though, and so is Bixby Vision. I think that some stock apps on the phone are much better than Google’s apps or stock Android apps. For instance, the Samsung Internet web browser is much smoother than Google Chrome, and offers more features, including extensions like advertisement removal tools and sports score tickers. Calendar, Gallery, Music Player, and Video Player apps are better than what Google offers as a part of stock Android. The slightly renewed camera app appears bloated now, though. Earlier versions of the app were cleaner to look at and easier to use as well. Indian units of the Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ come equipped with the company’s own Exynos 9810 processor. It uses a 64-bit octa-core CPU, consisting of four Exynos M3 cores with a maximum clock speed of 2.7GHz and four Cortex-A55 cores with a maximum clock speed of 1.8GHz. There’s Mali-G72 MP18 GPU. The new Exynos SoC is made using Samsung’s second-generation 10nm FinFET LPP fabrication process. It is physically larger than both the Snapdragon 845 and the Apple A11 Bionic because it has wider pipelines. Unit sold in China and the US use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC. The Galaxy S9+ comes with 6GB of LP-DDR4X RAM and 64GB/128GB/256GB of UFS 2.1 internal storage. Storage space can be expanded using a microSD card (up to 400GB). It is a widely-accepted fact that Apple’s chipsets offer much faster single-core performance compared to processors used in Android smartphones. However, the phone scored 3,641 points in Geekbench’s single-core test, beating every other Android smartphone out there. The single-core score is close to the single-core score of the A10 Fusion chipset used in the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus. So, I expected the Galaxy S9+ to perform much smoother than competing Android smartphones. However, I was disappointed by the phone’s performance. I noticed that the high single-core and multi-core score did not convert into smooth real-life performance. I came across stutters and lag every now and then while reviewing the phone over the course of three weeks. Performance inside Google apps was particularly bad, a classic Samsung problem. Even though the Exynos 9810 is physically bigger and the CPU has wider pipelines, it didn’t perform better than even last year’s Exynos 8895, and I think that it is due to the lack of proper software optimisation. I waited till the first software update was released to see if the performance improves, but it didn’t. In comparison, the OnePlus 5T and the Google Pixel 2 phones perform much smoother than the Galaxy S9+, which is a shame since the both phones are priced lower. All the new iPhones are considerably faster in day-to-day usage. The signal reception was pretty great, though, something that I always experience with Samsung phones. The phone features GPS, A-GPS, GLONASS, Galileo, BeiDou, dual-band Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac with MU-MIMO, Wi-Fi Direct, Google Cast, Miracast, Bluetooth 5.0, NFC, USB 3.1 Type-C port, and a 3.5mm audio port. The Galaxy S9+’s fingerprint reader is much faster than the one used on the Galaxy S8, S8+, and the Galaxy Note 8. Moreover, registering a fingerprint is much easier as well. All you have to do during the process is swipe the finger across the reader once. The iris scanner seems faster, too. Moreover, Samsung has also implemented Face Unlock and Smart Unlock in its latest flagship smartphone. Face Unlock is nowhere near as fast as the OnePlus 5T’s Face Unlock feature. Smart Unlock, which checks both face and iris, offers more convenience. It comes in handy when you can’t reach the fingerprint reader or when the finger is sweaty or wet. The newer heart rate monitor can also record blood pressure, a first in any phone that I’ve ever used. Kudos to Samsung for that!  Performance is not the only area where I was let down by the Galaxy S9+. The phone’s battery life left a lot to be desired. Although it has the same battery capacity (3500mAh) as that of the Galaxy S8+, I experienced shorter battery life. After a full charge (which takes about 100 minutes through a wired Fast Adaptive Charger), the phone lasted anywhere between 18-24 hours with a screen-on time of 3.5-4.5 hours. These figures were achieved by turning off the Always On Display mode. If you live in an area where there’s lot of sunlight, and you spend a lot of time outdoors, or if you use the AoD mode, expect the battery life to be even shorter. All the newer iPhones last longer than the Galaxy S9+, and so do the Google Pixel 2 XL (review), OnePlus 5T (review) and the Mi MIX 2 (review). In comparison, the OnePlus 5T offers a screen-on time of greater than 6 hours, while the Pixel 2 XL and the Mi MIX 2 offer more than 24-hours long battery life with screen-on time figures of 5 hours or longer. The iPhone X’s battery life is close to that of the Pixel 2 XL, while iPhone 8 Plus lasts slightly longer than the OnePlus 5T on a single full charge. The Galaxy S9+ is also compatible with Qi and PMA wireless chargers, and even fast wireless charging (7.5W), which I tested with Samsung’s Fast Wireless Chargers from 2016 and 2017.  The Samsung Galaxy S9+ is a near perfect Android smartphone. It looks sexy and is built quite well. The Galaxy S9+ has a one of the best screens in the market right now and arguably the best bezel-less design of 2018, devoid of the ugly screen notches we’ve come to see of late. It has loud, clear, and punchy dual stereo loudspeakers, plenty of useful software features and customisability, and Samsung Pay. The phone’s biggest upgrade is its imaging. It can capture bright and sharp images with close-to-accurate colours. It can also record 4K videos at 60fps, a first for any Android smartphone. However, the phone leaves a lot to be desired in real-world performance. The Exynos 9810’s chart-breaking single-core performance doesn’t convert into faster real-world performance. The UI stutters and the phone lags here and there. It’s not as smooth as relatively cheaper-priced phones like the OnePlus 5T or the Pixel 2 XL. AR Emojis and Super Slo Mo videos are gimmicks at best, and the battery life is shorter than even its predecessor. On top of that, you have to pay a hefty price for the phone. If you’re using any high-end phone from last year, the Galaxy S9+ won’t be a huge upgrade. Save your money for the Galaxy Note 9, iPhone X, or the next-generation Pixel phone. The Galaxy S9+ isn’t worth the money right now."
2261,32,/gear/2018/04/17/vivo-v9-review-notch-without-flaws/,0,0,2018-04-17,vivo-v9-review-notch-without-flaws, Awad Ballaith ,Vivo V9 Review: ‘Notch’ Without Its Flaws,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/2018/04/17/vivo-v9-review-notch-without-flaws/," Ever since the launch of the iPhone X, it was only a matter of time before Android smartphone makers started implementing the controversial notch on their devices. Even though it was the Essential Phone to first introduce this design quirk, it wasn’t until Apple adopted the design that it grabbed mainstream attention. The first such Android smartphone to have embraced this attribute and officially come to the Indian market is the Vivo V9. It follows in the same footsteps as many of its predecessors, in that it offers an enhanced camera setup with as many features that can be crammed into a smartphone these days. Having a notch at the top might not be an original innovation, but the move towards an almost completely full-front display measuring 6.3-inches is impressive. With so many contenders clamouring to bring notched devices to the market, can the Vivo V9 stand out of the crowd and hold the lead? Let’s find out in our in-depth review after using the smartphone for about two weeks. The iPhone X inspired design of the Vivo V9 is unmistakeable in more than one aspect. The most obvious being the notch at the top. We will get to the merits and demerits of that in a bit, but first, let’s take a look at why it is there. The notch houses the earpiece along with the front-facing 24-megapixel camera, proximity sensors, and a tiny notification light. The rest of the entire front is occupied by the edge-to-edge display with rounded corners. There is still a very tiny chin present at the bottom though, and one might wonder if it was possible for Vivo to have the bezel at the top instead and not have a notch altogether, but I digress. The exterior of the device has a plastic unibody design, with our review unit being the Pearl Black variant. Here, we also find the vertically stacked dual-camera setup with a 16MP primary snapper and a 5MP sensor. The fingerprint scanner is also placed at the back. Other than slight inconsistencies with fingerprint recognition, the scanner performed adequately. The volume rockers and power button sit on the right side of the device while the dual-SIM+SD card slot is present on the left. These buttons were satisfactorily tactile and unlike some other devices, protrude ever so slightly such that I did not have an issue with pressing the wrong button. The loudspeaker is present at the bottom just beside the micro USB charging port and headphone jack. Thankfully, this aspect is something Vivo decide not to copy from Apple. Still no USB Type-C though. The speaker itself was actually decent. It is louder than many other smartphones at this price-point and is usable enough even in slightly noisy environments. With that said, the audio quality isn’t anything that will blow you away, and I did have issues in some videos where the vocals were slightly muffled. Overall, the phone has a solid build to it even though the plastic back might not feel entirely premium. The display panel itself slightly protrudes from the phone’s frame. This might have been a design choice for providing grip but takes away from the seamless construction most other devices have these days. And another impediment was with the back being extremely susceptible to scratching and ended up with an incredible amount of scuffs on the very first day of use. Vivo does provide a transparent silicone case in the box which can help deal with the issue.  The Vivo V9’s 6.3-inch display dominates the front with a screen to body ratio of almost 90%. The Full HD+ display has a resolution of 1080 x 2280 pixels. Vivo calls this a FullView Display 2.0 since its aspect ratio is 19:9. This IPS LCD panel was admirably bright in sunlight and reproduces good colours. The large display admittedly provided a fun experience for most applications including social media and web browsing. The extra real estate was enjoyable to use while browsing Reddit threads and Facebook posts. The only main issue with the display was an unnatural pink hue that appeared when looking at it from an angle. The notch never really got in the way of the experience since the screen is large enough not to require elements to be hidden underneath, as long as you are in portrait orientation. On the right side of the notch, you will see information such as the battery, wifi signal and the alarm icon. On the left, you get the cellular signals, time and notification logos. The software lets you stretch applications to full screen even for those that might not have native support for this aspect ratio. The sides of the notch intuitively change colour depending on the colour present at the top of the app’s UI. Unfortunately, not everything works quite the way you would expect with the notch. I experienced problems such as Instagram stories sometimes appearing below the notch area and sometimes getting cut off by it. On the other hand, third-party apps are configured by default to run in their native aspect ratio. The first time you open an application, there will be blank space at its bottom, and the software prompts you if you want to go fullscreen. After you select the option, the application restarts and does go fullscreen, but will still display unacceptably large black bars in landscape orientation. It took me quite a while to figure out that I was supposed to manually set every third party app to also run in full screen in landscape by going into the ‘Third-party app display ratio’ under the ‘Display and Brightness’ setting. This would restart the application for the second time. Once you are able to get the apps to start working in fullscreen correctly, the experience is enjoyable. The notch will cut off some content in landscape, but otherwise, it doesn’t really become much of a hindrance in day-to-day use. Videos can be adjusted not to be blocked by the notch, but that will result in having black bars on either side. The main issue with the display was the pinkish hue and having to tediously enable applications for the fullscreen experience. It would have been preferable if Vivo had enabled fullscreen by default and instead given the option to revert to native resolution later.  Vivo is known for catering to the selfie-conscious market and this time is no exception. The Vivo V9 offers a 24-megapixel camera with ƒ/2.0 aperture at the front which boasts various AI enhancements for better images. At the rear, the phone contains a vertically stacked setup that holds 16 MP + 5MP shooters with ƒ/2.0 aperture. It offers all of the usual features you’d expect such as HDR, portrait bokeh and professional mode and panorama. Additionally, you get so-called “AI enhancements” that detect your gender and set the beauty mode accordingly with either of the cameras. Initially, I wasn’t too sure about the selfie camera but was pleasantly surprised at how much detail it was able to capture. The rear camera setup also performed considerably well but did present some issues with the fine details and colour saturation. I did like the simplistic camera software that wasn’t overly complicated to use. The ability to shoot 4K videos with both cameras is a welcome bonus, but with the lack of OIS, I wasn’t sold on its results. An added feature called ‘AR stickers’ works similar to how Snapchat overlays silly cat ears, a beard or sunglasses on a face. Overall, the front camera performed better than the rear. Selfies had enough detail and portrait mode worked accurately most of the time. You can use the display-flash to take low light selfies which worked remarkably well. The rear camera was quick to capture images but sometimes had issues with capturing details. In bright light, the colours were slightly on the darker side. Low-light pictures from the rear camera did present with some noise, but this was acceptable considering the performance of other devices in this price segment.  I was excited to learn that the Vivo V9 shipped with Android 8.1 Oreo out of the box. However, you are greeted with Vivo’s Funtouch OS 4.0 as soon as you start using the device and are again reminded of how much iOS influences this device. The UI very closely resembles iOS in quite a few aspects including the visuals and placement of icons, the notification section and shortcuts toggle menu. Swiping down from the status bar will bring down the notification page without any shortcut toggles. For those, you will need to swipe up from the bottom, which presents a half screen ‘Control Centre’, quite reminiscent of the one found on iOS 10. Other than being able to press the dedicated on-screen button for the recently-used apps list, Control Centre also contains icons of these apps. The settings menu has also been directly copied from iOS, and you even get the option to replace the on-screen buttons with gesture-based navigation, which is almost identical to that found on the iPhone X. The procedure of deleting applications has also been blatantly copied. The home screen houses all of the applications, and you do not get the option to switch to a traditional app drawer unless you opt for some third-party solution. The amount of bloatware on this device isn’t substantially high. There are a few Vivo apps such as the V-Appstore and vivoCloud. There is also an app called vivo.com that basically leads you to Vivo’s website with some added functions of logging in and getting details for Vivo’s customer support. It was frustrating for me when I saw that the OS includes apps called ‘i Music’, ‘i Theme’ and ‘i Manager’. For some reason, there is also an icon on the home screen that simply says “Lock”. I’ll leave it up to you to guess what this does. In some aspects, the custom OS seems to stray away from the mainstream Android experience but still manages to include some features that might come in handy. A feature called ‘blank screen glance’ lets you wave your hand over the notch to display your status bar and time while the rest of the screen stays black. Another called ‘Air unlock’ works the same way to unlock your device as long as you don’t have any lock screen passwords enabled. The phone includes ’Raise to wake’ your device while ‘Smart keep bright’ will keep the phone unlocked until the front camera detects your face. There is a ‘Game mode’ that gives you quite a few options in order to have an uninterrupted gaming session. Similarly, there is a ‘Motorbike mode’ that can be used to mute notifications, reject calls and auto-reply with an SMS. This mode also reads your location data to figure out when you are in motion and will not let you answer a call until you stop your vehicle. ‘Smart click’ lets you turn on your flash, open camera or open any desired application by long pressing the volume down button when the screen is turned off. The phone also allows ‘App clone’ for supported apps. Overall the software experience was a mixed bag for me. I eventually became accustomed to the UI, but the iOS-inspired theme was distracting at times. And this is coming from someone who has been using an iOS smartphone as his personal daily driver for years now. There is only so far you can go with copying something before it becomes unnecessarily forced. I did appreciate the added features such as ‘Smart Split’, ‘One-handed’ mode with ‘One-handed keyboard’ and ‘access to a mini screen using a gesture’. All I can say is that the software requires a learning curve and it comes down to your personal preference of using a heavily modified version of Android or sticking with the stock experience.  Powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 626, the Vivo V9 clearly falls into the mid-tier category of smartphones. This is coupled with a reasonable combination of 4GB of RAM along with 64 GB of internal storage. I appreciate that fact that Vivo gives the option to expand the storage (up to 256GB via microSD card) while still being able to have two SIM cards on this device. It is slightly confusing as to why Vivo opted for a previous generation CPU when even the lesser priced Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Prof comes with Snapdragon 636. But that isn’t a major concern as the Vivo V9 performs quite well for what it offers. Moving between apps might not be as fast as on a flagship, but was still quite smooth. Having an Adreno 506 for its GPU ensured that games ran considerably well without getting too hot. The plastic body does help dissipate the small amount of heat that might result when gaming for long durations. Other than the previously mentioned fingerprint scanner, the Vivo V9 also features facial recognition using it’s 24MP front-facing shooter. In my testing I found this to be quite inconsistent. I made sure to give the V9 a fair chance and considering the price range of this device; I set my expectations accordingly. But unfortunately, the phone could recognise my face correctly only in the brightest of conditions. I expected the phone to have issues in dimly-lit environments, but even moderate lighting conditions posed a challenge. I tested the feature multiple times without changing anything, and I would encounter situations where it would either detect my face instantly or not detect my face at all. In fact, the Honor 9 Lite I reviewed recently had better facial recognition on it, and that phone costs almost half as much.  The battery life on the Vivo V9 was more in the acceptable range. The custom Funtouch OS takes away the ability to view the device’s screen-on time. So, after having to check the battery consumption of every single app manually, the Vivo V9’s 3260mAh battery was able to give approximately 6 hours of screen-on time while surviving almost 45 hours on standby. It would be possible to get better screen-on times with the included power saving modes.  Considering the phone has a Snapdragon 626 as its processor and its display isn’t more than a Full HD+ panel, I expected the battery to last a bit more. It would also have been preferable to get fast charging on this device.  The Vivo V9 is a step in the right direction but just misses the mark. The notch might be here to stay now, and I personally don’t mind it as much. With that said, there are still some improvements to be had with how the software works around it. The Snapdragon 626 on the V9 provides decent performance for a budget phone, but the battery life could have been better. For roughly Rs. 22,990 you get an excellent front camera with a decent rear shooter, acceptable battery life and useable performance. The large display provided a remarkable experience, but the bothersome pink hue is difficult to ignore. If you desire a more consistent package with a better processor and exceptional battery life at a lower price point, then you will be better off with a Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (review)."
2261,32,/gear/2018/04/17/vivo-v9-review-notch-without-flaws/,0,0,2018-04-17,vivo-v9-review-notch-without-flaws, Awad Ballaith ,Vivo V9 Review: ‘Notch’ Without Its Flaws,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/2018/04/17/vivo-v9-review-notch-without-flaws/," Ever since the launch of the iPhone X, it was only a matter of time before Android smartphone makers started implementing the controversial notch on their devices. Even though it was the Essential Phone to first introduce this design quirk, it wasn’t until Apple adopted the design that it grabbed mainstream attention. The first such Android smartphone to have embraced this attribute and officially come to the Indian market is the Vivo V9. It follows in the same footsteps as many of its predecessors, in that it offers an enhanced camera setup with as many features that can be crammed into a smartphone these days. Having a notch at the top might not be an original innovation, but the move towards an almost completely full-front display measuring 6.3-inches is impressive. With so many contenders clamouring to bring notched devices to the market, can the Vivo V9 stand out of the crowd and hold the lead? Let’s find out in our in-depth review after using the smartphone for about two weeks. The iPhone X inspired design of the Vivo V9 is unmistakeable in more than one aspect. The most obvious being the notch at the top. We will get to the merits and demerits of that in a bit, but first, let’s take a look at why it is there. The notch houses the earpiece along with the front-facing 24-megapixel camera, proximity sensors, and a tiny notification light. The rest of the entire front is occupied by the edge-to-edge display with rounded corners. There is still a very tiny chin present at the bottom though, and one might wonder if it was possible for Vivo to have the bezel at the top instead and not have a notch altogether, but I digress. The exterior of the device has a plastic unibody design, with our review unit being the Pearl Black variant. Here, we also find the vertically stacked dual-camera setup with a 16MP primary snapper and a 5MP sensor. The fingerprint scanner is also placed at the back. Other than slight inconsistencies with fingerprint recognition, the scanner performed adequately. The volume rockers and power button sit on the right side of the device while the dual-SIM+SD card slot is present on the left. These buttons were satisfactorily tactile and unlike some other devices, protrude ever so slightly such that I did not have an issue with pressing the wrong button. The loudspeaker is present at the bottom just beside the micro USB charging port and headphone jack. Thankfully, this aspect is something Vivo decide not to copy from Apple. Still no USB Type-C though. The speaker itself was actually decent. It is louder than many other smartphones at this price-point and is usable enough even in slightly noisy environments. With that said, the audio quality isn’t anything that will blow you away, and I did have issues in some videos where the vocals were slightly muffled. Overall, the phone has a solid build to it even though the plastic back might not feel entirely premium. The display panel itself slightly protrudes from the phone’s frame. This might have been a design choice for providing grip but takes away from the seamless construction most other devices have these days. And another impediment was with the back being extremely susceptible to scratching and ended up with an incredible amount of scuffs on the very first day of use. Vivo does provide a transparent silicone case in the box which can help deal with the issue.  The Vivo V9’s 6.3-inch display dominates the front with a screen to body ratio of almost 90%. The Full HD+ display has a resolution of 1080 x 2280 pixels. Vivo calls this a FullView Display 2.0 since its aspect ratio is 19:9. This IPS LCD panel was admirably bright in sunlight and reproduces good colours. The large display admittedly provided a fun experience for most applications including social media and web browsing. The extra real estate was enjoyable to use while browsing Reddit threads and Facebook posts. The only main issue with the display was an unnatural pink hue that appeared when looking at it from an angle. The notch never really got in the way of the experience since the screen is large enough not to require elements to be hidden underneath, as long as you are in portrait orientation. On the right side of the notch, you will see information such as the battery, wifi signal and the alarm icon. On the left, you get the cellular signals, time and notification logos. The software lets you stretch applications to full screen even for those that might not have native support for this aspect ratio. The sides of the notch intuitively change colour depending on the colour present at the top of the app’s UI. Unfortunately, not everything works quite the way you would expect with the notch. I experienced problems such as Instagram stories sometimes appearing below the notch area and sometimes getting cut off by it. On the other hand, third-party apps are configured by default to run in their native aspect ratio. The first time you open an application, there will be blank space at its bottom, and the software prompts you if you want to go fullscreen. After you select the option, the application restarts and does go fullscreen, but will still display unacceptably large black bars in landscape orientation. It took me quite a while to figure out that I was supposed to manually set every third party app to also run in full screen in landscape by going into the ‘Third-party app display ratio’ under the ‘Display and Brightness’ setting. This would restart the application for the second time. Once you are able to get the apps to start working in fullscreen correctly, the experience is enjoyable. The notch will cut off some content in landscape, but otherwise, it doesn’t really become much of a hindrance in day-to-day use. Videos can be adjusted not to be blocked by the notch, but that will result in having black bars on either side. The main issue with the display was the pinkish hue and having to tediously enable applications for the fullscreen experience. It would have been preferable if Vivo had enabled fullscreen by default and instead given the option to revert to native resolution later.  Vivo is known for catering to the selfie-conscious market and this time is no exception. The Vivo V9 offers a 24-megapixel camera with ƒ/2.0 aperture at the front which boasts various AI enhancements for better images. At the rear, the phone contains a vertically stacked setup that holds 16 MP + 5MP shooters with ƒ/2.0 aperture. It offers all of the usual features you’d expect such as HDR, portrait bokeh and professional mode and panorama. Additionally, you get so-called “AI enhancements” that detect your gender and set the beauty mode accordingly with either of the cameras. Initially, I wasn’t too sure about the selfie camera but was pleasantly surprised at how much detail it was able to capture. The rear camera setup also performed considerably well but did present some issues with the fine details and colour saturation. I did like the simplistic camera software that wasn’t overly complicated to use. The ability to shoot 4K videos with both cameras is a welcome bonus, but with the lack of OIS, I wasn’t sold on its results. An added feature called ‘AR stickers’ works similar to how Snapchat overlays silly cat ears, a beard or sunglasses on a face. Overall, the front camera performed better than the rear. Selfies had enough detail and portrait mode worked accurately most of the time. You can use the display-flash to take low light selfies which worked remarkably well. The rear camera was quick to capture images but sometimes had issues with capturing details. In bright light, the colours were slightly on the darker side. Low-light pictures from the rear camera did present with some noise, but this was acceptable considering the performance of other devices in this price segment.  I was excited to learn that the Vivo V9 shipped with Android 8.1 Oreo out of the box. However, you are greeted with Vivo’s Funtouch OS 4.0 as soon as you start using the device and are again reminded of how much iOS influences this device. The UI very closely resembles iOS in quite a few aspects including the visuals and placement of icons, the notification section and shortcuts toggle menu. Swiping down from the status bar will bring down the notification page without any shortcut toggles. For those, you will need to swipe up from the bottom, which presents a half screen ‘Control Centre’, quite reminiscent of the one found on iOS 10. Other than being able to press the dedicated on-screen button for the recently-used apps list, Control Centre also contains icons of these apps. The settings menu has also been directly copied from iOS, and you even get the option to replace the on-screen buttons with gesture-based navigation, which is almost identical to that found on the iPhone X. The procedure of deleting applications has also been blatantly copied. The home screen houses all of the applications, and you do not get the option to switch to a traditional app drawer unless you opt for some third-party solution. The amount of bloatware on this device isn’t substantially high. There are a few Vivo apps such as the V-Appstore and vivoCloud. There is also an app called vivo.com that basically leads you to Vivo’s website with some added functions of logging in and getting details for Vivo’s customer support. It was frustrating for me when I saw that the OS includes apps called ‘i Music’, ‘i Theme’ and ‘i Manager’. For some reason, there is also an icon on the home screen that simply says “Lock”. I’ll leave it up to you to guess what this does. In some aspects, the custom OS seems to stray away from the mainstream Android experience but still manages to include some features that might come in handy. A feature called ‘blank screen glance’ lets you wave your hand over the notch to display your status bar and time while the rest of the screen stays black. Another called ‘Air unlock’ works the same way to unlock your device as long as you don’t have any lock screen passwords enabled. The phone includes ’Raise to wake’ your device while ‘Smart keep bright’ will keep the phone unlocked until the front camera detects your face. There is a ‘Game mode’ that gives you quite a few options in order to have an uninterrupted gaming session. Similarly, there is a ‘Motorbike mode’ that can be used to mute notifications, reject calls and auto-reply with an SMS. This mode also reads your location data to figure out when you are in motion and will not let you answer a call until you stop your vehicle. ‘Smart click’ lets you turn on your flash, open camera or open any desired application by long pressing the volume down button when the screen is turned off. The phone also allows ‘App clone’ for supported apps. Overall the software experience was a mixed bag for me. I eventually became accustomed to the UI, but the iOS-inspired theme was distracting at times. And this is coming from someone who has been using an iOS smartphone as his personal daily driver for years now. There is only so far you can go with copying something before it becomes unnecessarily forced. I did appreciate the added features such as ‘Smart Split’, ‘One-handed’ mode with ‘One-handed keyboard’ and ‘access to a mini screen using a gesture’. All I can say is that the software requires a learning curve and it comes down to your personal preference of using a heavily modified version of Android or sticking with the stock experience.  Powered by an octa-core Snapdragon 626, the Vivo V9 clearly falls into the mid-tier category of smartphones. This is coupled with a reasonable combination of 4GB of RAM along with 64 GB of internal storage. I appreciate that fact that Vivo gives the option to expand the storage (up to 256GB via microSD card) while still being able to have two SIM cards on this device. It is slightly confusing as to why Vivo opted for a previous generation CPU when even the lesser priced Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Prof comes with Snapdragon 636. But that isn’t a major concern as the Vivo V9 performs quite well for what it offers. Moving between apps might not be as fast as on a flagship, but was still quite smooth. Having an Adreno 506 for its GPU ensured that games ran considerably well without getting too hot. The plastic body does help dissipate the small amount of heat that might result when gaming for long durations. Other than the previously mentioned fingerprint scanner, the Vivo V9 also features facial recognition using it’s 24MP front-facing shooter. In my testing I found this to be quite inconsistent. I made sure to give the V9 a fair chance and considering the price range of this device; I set my expectations accordingly. But unfortunately, the phone could recognise my face correctly only in the brightest of conditions. I expected the phone to have issues in dimly-lit environments, but even moderate lighting conditions posed a challenge. I tested the feature multiple times without changing anything, and I would encounter situations where it would either detect my face instantly or not detect my face at all. In fact, the Honor 9 Lite I reviewed recently had better facial recognition on it, and that phone costs almost half as much.  The battery life on the Vivo V9 was more in the acceptable range. The custom Funtouch OS takes away the ability to view the device’s screen-on time. So, after having to check the battery consumption of every single app manually, the Vivo V9’s 3260mAh battery was able to give approximately 6 hours of screen-on time while surviving almost 45 hours on standby. It would be possible to get better screen-on times with the included power saving modes.  Considering the phone has a Snapdragon 626 as its processor and its display isn’t more than a Full HD+ panel, I expected the battery to last a bit more. It would also have been preferable to get fast charging on this device.  The Vivo V9 is a step in the right direction but just misses the mark. The notch might be here to stay now, and I personally don’t mind it as much. With that said, there are still some improvements to be had with how the software works around it. The Snapdragon 626 on the V9 provides decent performance for a budget phone, but the battery life could have been better.

2240,32,/gear/2018/05/04/xiaomi-redmi-5-review/,0,0,2018-05-04,xiaomi-redmi-5-review, Abid Iqbal ,Xiaomi Redmi 5 Review: The Best Entry-Level Smartphone So Far,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/2018/05/04/xiaomi-redmi-5-review/," Xiaomi has led the entry-level smartphone market from as long as its existence in India goes. I still remember when the Redmi 1s was launched in India; it had every essential feature for just Rs. 5,999. Although people were a bit sceptical at the time about buying it, as Xiaomi was a new, unknown brand to the Indian consumers.  Later, Xiaomi launched the Redmi 2, Redmi 3, and Redmi 4, all of which were among the highest selling smartphones in India. I recall how crazy people went for the Redmi 4; its demand was so high that even I couldn’t get one in a flash sale.  Now, Xiaomi has launched the Redmi 5 and looking at the specs, I speculated it would be another hit device from Xiaomi, but good hardware specifications don’t always mean that it would have a good overall smartphone. So does the Xiaomi Redmi 5 performs as good as its hardware sounds?  Here is what I think after using the device for two weeks.  The most significant upgrade Redmi 5 brings over its predecessor is the bezel-less display. Before the launch of the Redmi 5, I expected it to have a more powerful processor, and a larger battery, etc., but I never expected it to have a bezel-less display. Making a smartphone bezel-less increases the production cost, and I knew Xiaomi wouldn’t waste resources on such features, but Xiaomi somehow managed to include a bezel-less screen among the other upgrades; Kudos to Xiaomi for it. The display is a 5.7-inch IPS LCD unit with HD+ resolution. The screen missies out on Corning Gorilla Glass protection, but during my usage, I didn’t feel the lack of it. I dropped the device accidentally a couple of times on hard surfaces, and that too directly on the screen, but the display didn’t break. Same goes for the scratch-resistance, the screen didn’t pick any scratch even after two weeks of usage.  As for the quality of the display, it’s excellent. The first thing I noticed is how smooth the surface of the screen is; this usually isn’t the case with other entry-level smartphones. The second thing I noticed is that the display feels pasted on the surface, just like that on the mid-range and high-end smartphones. The viewing angles of the display are excellent, and so is the brightness level. The contrast ratio is excellent too, the colours just pop-out. Though the display resolution is on par with the other devices in its price range, I found it to be inadequate. The icons in the notification bar appear pixelated, and the small-sized text while web browsing looks pixelated too. I hope Xiaomi will equip the future entry-level smartphones with a higher resolution display.  The Xiaomi Redmi 5 has a 12MP primary camera with phase-detection autofocus, and a 5MP front-facing camera, both cameras also feature an LED flash. In daylight, the images from the primary camera have just adequate amount of details. If you zoom-in the image, you can find that the images don’t capture the minute details, which is not surprising for a budget smartphone, but I expected better from the Redmi 5. The focusing is fast, but not accurate always; the camera sometimes gets confused, especially while capturing macro images, resulting in a blurry picture. On the positive side, the images have a very vibrant colour tone, giving the users a sense of quality. While the daylight images are just fine, I am very much disappointed with the lowlight image quality. The lowlight images have tons and tons of noise, and there is a considerable lack of details, even for a budget smartphone. All you can see in the images are the subjects, that too with very fewer details; the background details are almost non-existent.   The videos are recorded at Full HD resolution; they have a smooth frame rate without any occasional frame drops. Unlike the images, the videos have a washed-out colour tone. The videos also lack detail, and their audio recording is not up to the mark either. Although that is the case with every entry-level smartphone, so I wouldn’t blame Xiaomi; you get what you pay. Coming to the front-facing camera, it has a satisfactory image quality. The daylight selfies have a decent amount of details along with a vibrant colour tone. The lowlight selfies also turn out to be bright and detailed, thanks to the front-facing LED flash.  It is surprising to see the Snapdragon 450 SoC in the Redmi 5, as it is usually seen in smartphones above Rs. 10,000. The Snapdragon 450 has eight CPU cores and Adreno 506 GPU; it is even capable of handling smartphones with Full HD displays. The Redmi 5 is available in 2GB and 3GB RAM variants, and the one we received from Xiaomi has 3GB of RAM. The device was running Android 7.1.1 Nougat OS with MIUI 9 when we got it for review. Later, the device received the MIUI 9.5 update.  Opening apps and switching between the applications is fast and smooth; there are no stutters or frame drops either. For the price, it is the fastest smartphone I’ve used so far. The only issue I found is that all the apps get closed in the background when you try to open more than 10 to 12 apps, but I think it is a minor issue that can be fixed with a software update. The Redmi 5 also has a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, and it’s very fast, as fast as that of the iPhone. Coming to the MIUI 9.5, what I liked the most about it is that it is tailored for Indian consumers. The device has Indian-oriented calendar, which shows all the Indian holidays. The messaging app has also been customised to filter out spam messages, and highlight the OTP codes in them. Even the remote control app has been tailored for Indian appliances. There is also dual-apps, app locker, reading mode, customisable themes, and Mi Cloud. All these small features and attention to details enhance the user experience a lot. Overall, I am delighted with the performance of the Redmi 5, and no other smartphone in the same price range provides such a satisfactory user experience.  The Xiaomi Redmi 5 has a great battery backup too. The device lasted a day and a half with approximately 8 hours of screen-on time. Even while using WiFi hotspot, the battery drain was very minimal. The battery capacity is just 3200mAh, but it still has an excellent performance. The device doesn’t has fast charging option, and I wouldn’t expect one for the price; it took 2 hours and 35 minutes for the device to charge from 0 to 100 percent. The Redmi 5 comes with a hybrid SIM card slot, which means it can’t accommodate two SIM cards and a microSD card at once. Hence, opting for higher storage option would be a wise choice. The device also has microUSB port, 3.5mm audio jack, Bluetooth v4.2, GPS, and an infrared port.  The call quality and signal reception are fine; people on either side of the call were able to listen properly. The bottom firing loudspeaker is loud enough too; I was able to hear the ringtone even in the noisy Indian environment. However, the audio quality from the 3.5mm audio jack isn’t good. The tonal accuracy is way off, there is distortion in the highs, and the bass lacks punch. Even adjusting the equaliser didn’t make much of a difference, but hey, for the price I think the audio quality is acceptable.  The Xiaomi Redmi 5 faces competition from the Nokia 3, Samsung Galaxy J7 Nxt, Motorola Moto E4 Plus, Infocus Vision 3, and Xiaomi’s own Redmi Y1. Among all the competitors, the Xiaomi Redmi 5 has the best display, longest battery backup, and also the fastest and smoothest performance. The device lived up to the exception in every criteria except the lowlight performance from the primary camera. I think the lousy lowlight performance isn’t a deal-breaker as the device has many more things to offer. For the price, I think the Redmi 5 is the best smartphone one can buy if they can get their hands on one, that is. "

The first thing I noticed is how smooth the surface of the screen is; this usually isnât the case with other entry-level smartphones. The second thing I noticed is that the display feels pasted on the surface, just like that on the mid-range and high-end smartphones. The viewing angles of the display are excellent, and so is the brightness level. The contrast ratio is excellent too, the colours just pop-out. Though the display resolution is on par with the other devices in its price range, I found it to be inadequate. The icons in the notification bar appear pixelated, and the small-sized text while web browsing looks pixelated too. I hope Xiaomi will equip the future entry-level smartphones with a higher resolution display.  The Xiaomi Redmi 5 has a 12MP primary camera with phase-detection autofocus, and a 5MP front-facing camera, both cameras also feature an LED flash. In daylight, the images from the primary camera have just adequate amount of details. If you zoom-in the image, you can find that the images donât capture the minute details, which is not surprising for a budget smartphone, but I expected better from the Redmi 5. The focusing is fast, but not accurate always; the camera sometimes gets confused, especially while capturing macro images, resulting in a blurry picture. On the positive side, the images have a very vibrant colour tone, giving the users a sense of quality. While the daylight images are just fine, I am very much disappointed with the lowlight image quality. The lowlight images have tons and tons of noise, and there is a considerable lack of details, even for a budget smartphone. All you can see in the images are the subjects, that too with very fewer details; the background details are almost non-existent. Â  The videos are recorded at Full HD resolution; they have a smooth frame rate without any occasional frame drops. Unlike the images, the videos have a washed-out colour tone. The videos also lack detail, and their audio recording is not up to the mark either. Although that is the case with every entry-level smartphone, so I wouldnât blame Xiaomi; you get what you pay. Coming to the front-facing camera, it has a satisfactory image quality. The daylight selfies have a decent amount of details along with a vibrant colour tone. The lowlight selfies also turn out to be bright and detailed, thanks to the front-facing LED flash.  It is surprising to see the Snapdragon 450 SoC in the Redmi 5, as it is usually seen in smartphones above Rs. 10,000. The Snapdragon 450 has eight CPU cores and Adreno 506 GPU; it is even capable of handling smartphones with Full HD displays. The Redmi 5 is available in 2GB and 3GB RAM variants, and the one we received from Xiaomi has 3GB of RAM. The device was running Android 7.1.1 Nougat OS with MIUI 9 when we got it for review. Later, the device received the MIUI 9.5 update.Â  Opening apps and switching between the applications is fast and smooth; there are no stutters or frame drops either. For the price, it is the fastest smartphone Iâve used so far. The only issue I found is that all the apps get closed in the background when you try to open more than 10 to 12 apps, but I think it is a minor issue that can be fixed with a software update. The Redmi 5 also has a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, and it’s very fast, as fast as that of the iPhone. Coming to the MIUI 9.5, what I liked the most about it is that it is tailored for Indian consumers. The device has Indian-oriented calendar, which shows all the Indian holidays. The messaging app has also been customised to filter out spam messages, and highlight the OTP codes in them. Even the remote control app has been tailored for Indian appliances. There is also dual-apps, app locker, reading mode, customisable themes, and Mi Cloud. All these small features and attention to details enhance the user experience a lot. Overall, I am delighted with the performance of the Redmi 5, and no other smartphone in the same price range provides such a satisfactory user experience.  The Xiaomi Redmi 5 has a great battery backup too. The device lasted a day and a half with approximately 8 hours of screen-on time. Even while using WiFi hotspot, the battery drain was very minimal. The battery capacity is just 3200mAh, but it still has an excellent performance. The device doesnât has fast charging option, and I wouldnât expect one for the price; it took 2 hours and 35 minutes for the device to charge from 0 to 100 percent. The Redmi 5 comes with a hybrid SIM card slot, which means it canât accommodate two SIM cards and a microSD card at once. Hence, opting for higher storage option would be a wise choice. The device also has microUSB port, 3.5mm audio jack, Bluetooth v4.2, GPS, and an infrared port.Â  The call quality and signal reception are fine; people on either side of the call were able to listen properly. The bottom firing loudspeaker is loud enough too; I was able to hear the ringtone even in the noisy Indian environment. However, the audio quality from the 3.5mm audio jack isnât good. The tonal accuracy is way off, there is distortion in the highs, and the bass lacks punch. Even adjusting the equaliser didnât make much of a difference, but hey, for the price I think the audio quality is acceptable.  The Xiaomi Redmi 5 faces competition from the Nokia 3, Samsung Galaxy J7 Nxt, Motorola Moto E4 Plus, Infocus Vision 3, and Xiaomiâs own Redmi Y1. Among all the competitors, the Xiaomi Redmi 5 has the best display, longest battery backup, and also the fastest and smoothest performance. The device lived up to the exception in every criteria except the lowlight performance from the primary camera. I think the lousy lowlight performance isnât a deal-breaker as the device has many more things to offer. For the price, I think the Redmi 5 is the best smartphone one can buy if they can get their hands on one, that is.Â "

I still remember when the Redmi 1s was launched in India; it had every essential feature for just Rs. 5,999. Although people were a bit sceptical at the time about buying it, as Xiaomi was a new, unknown brand to the Indian consumers.Â  Later, Xiaomi launched the Redmi 2, Redmi 3, and Redmi 4, all of which were among the highest selling smartphones in India. I recall how crazy people went for the Redmi 4; its demand was so high that even I couldnât get one in a flash sale.Â  Now, Xiaomi has launched the Redmi 5 and looking at the specs, I speculated it would be another hit device from Xiaomi, but good hardware specifications donât always mean that it would have a good overall smartphone. So does the Xiaomi Redmi 5 performs as good as its hardware sounds?Â  Here is what I think after using the device for two weeks.  The most significant upgrade Redmi 5 brings over its predecessor is the bezel-less display. Before the launch of the Redmi 5, I expected it to have a more powerful processor, and a larger battery, etc., but I never expected it to have a bezel-less display. Making a smartphone bezel-less increases the production cost, and I knew Xiaomi wouldnât waste resources on such features, but Xiaomi somehow managed to include a bezel-less screen among the other upgrades; Kudos to Xiaomi for it. The display is a 5.7-inch IPS LCD unit with HD+ resolution. The screen missies out on Corning Gorilla Glass protection, but during my usage, I didnât feel the lack of it.

The second thing I noticed is that the display feels pasted on the surface, just like that on the mid-range and high-end smartphones. The viewing angles of the display are excellent, and so is the brightness level. The contrast ratio is excellent too, the colours just pop-out. Though the display resolution is on par with the other devices in its price range, I found it to be inadequate. The icons in the notification bar appear pixelated, and the small-sized text while web browsing looks pixelated too. I hope Xiaomi will equip the future entry-level smartphones with a higher resolution display.  The Xiaomi Redmi 5 has a 12MP primary camera with phase-detection autofocus, and a 5MP front-facing camera, both cameras also feature an LED flash. In daylight, the images from the primary camera have just adequate amount of details. If you zoom-in the image, you can find that the images donât capture the minute details, which is not surprising for a budget smartphone, but I expected better from the Redmi 5. The focusing is fast, but not accurate always; the camera sometimes gets confused, especially while capturing macro images, resulting in a blurry picture. On the positive side, the images have a very vibrant colour tone, giving the users a sense of quality. While the daylight images are just fine, I am very much disappointed with the lowlight image quality. The lowlight images have tons and tons of noise, and there is a considerable lack of details, even for a budget smartphone. All you can see in the images are the subjects, that too with very fewer details; the background details are almost non-existent. Â  The videos are recorded at Full HD resolution; they have a smooth frame rate without any occasional frame drops. Unlike the images, the videos have a washed-out colour tone. The videos also lack detail, and their audio recording is not up to the mark either. Although that is the case with every entry-level smartphone, so I wouldnât blame Xiaomi; you get what you pay. Coming to the front-facing camera, it has a satisfactory image quality. The daylight selfies have a decent amount of details along with a vibrant colour tone. The lowlight selfies also turn out to be bright and detailed, thanks to the front-facing LED flash.  It is surprising to see the Snapdragon 450 SoC in the Redmi 5, as it is usually seen in smartphones above Rs. 10,000. The Snapdragon 450 has eight CPU cores and Adreno 506 GPU; it is even capable of handling smartphones with Full HD displays. The Redmi 5 is available in 2GB and 3GB RAM variants, and the one we received from Xiaomi has 3GB of RAM. The device was running Android 7.1.1 Nougat OS with MIUI 9 when we got it for review. Later, the device received the MIUI 9.5 update.Â  Opening apps and switching between the applications is fast and smooth; there are no stutters or frame drops either. For the price, it is the fastest smartphone Iâve used so far. The only issue I found is that all the apps get closed in the background when you try to open more than 10 to 12 apps, but I think it is a minor issue that can be fixed with a software update. The Redmi 5 also has a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner, and it’s very fast, as fast as that of the iPhone. Coming to the MIUI 9.5, what I liked the most about it is that it is tailored for Indian consumers. The device has Indian-oriented calendar, which shows all the Indian holidays. The messaging app has also been customised to filter out spam messages, and highlight the OTP codes in them. Even the remote control app has been tailored for Indian appliances. There is also dual-apps, app locker, reading mode, customisable themes, and Mi Cloud. All these small features and attention to details enhance the user experience a lot. Overall, I am delighted with the performance of the Redmi 5, and no other smartphone in the same price range provides such a satisfactory user experience.  The Xiaomi Redmi 5 has a great battery backup too. The device lasted a day and a half with approximately 8 hours of screen-on time. Even while using WiFi hotspot, the battery drain was very minimal. The battery capacity is just 3200mAh, but it still has an excellent performance. The device doesnât has fast charging option, and I wouldnât expect one for the price; it took 2 hours and 35 minutes for the device to charge from 0 to 100 percent. The Redmi 5 comes with a hybrid SIM card slot, which means it canât accommodate two SIM cards and a microSD card at once. Hence, opting for higher storage option would be a wise choice. The device also has microUSB port, 3.5mm audio jack, Bluetooth v4.2, GPS, and an infrared port.Â  The call quality and signal reception are fine; people on either side of the call were able to listen properly. The bottom firing loudspeaker is loud enough too; I was able to hear the ringtone even in the noisy Indian environment. However, the audio quality from the 3.5mm audio jack isnât good. The tonal accuracy is way off, there is distortion in the highs, and the bass lacks punch. Even adjusting the equaliser didnât make much of a difference, but hey, for the price I think the audio quality is acceptable.  The Xiaomi Redmi 5 faces competition from the Nokia 3, Samsung Galaxy J7 Nxt, Motorola Moto E4 Plus, Infocus Vision 3, and Xiaomiâs own Redmi Y1. Among all the competitors, the Xiaomi Redmi 5 has the best display, longest battery backup, and also the fastest and smoothest performance. The device lived up to the exception in every criteria except the lowlight performance from the primary camera. I think the lousy lowlight performance isnât a deal-breaker as the device has many more things to offer. For the price, I think the Redmi 5 is the best smartphone one can buy if they can get their hands on one, that is.Â "
2240,32,/gear/2018/05/04/xiaomi-redmi-5-review/,0,0,2018-05-04,xiaomi-redmi-5-review, Abid Iqbal ,Xiaomi Redmi 5 Review: The Best Entry-Level Smartphone So Far,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/2018/05/04/xiaomi-redmi-5-review/," Xiaomi has led the entry-level smartphone market from as long as its existence in India goes. I still remember when the Redmi 1s was launched in India; it had every essential feature for just Rs. 5,999. Although people were a bit sceptical at the time about buying it, as Xiaomi was a new, unknown brand to the Indian consumers.Â  Later, Xiaomi launched the Redmi 2, Redmi 3, and Redmi 4, all of which were among the highest selling smartphones in India. I recall how crazy people went for the Redmi 4; its demand was so high that even I couldnât get one in a flash sale.Â  Now, Xiaomi has launched the Redmi 5 and looking at the specs, I speculated it would be another hit device from Xiaomi, but good hardware specifications donât always mean that it would have a good overall smartphone. So does the Xiaomi Redmi 5 performs as good as its hardware sounds?Â  Here is what I think after using the device for two weeks.  The most significant upgrade Redmi 5 brings over its predecessor is the bezel-less display. Before the launch of the Redmi 5, I expected it to have a more powerful processor, and a larger battery, etc., but I never expected it to have a bezel-less display. Making a smartphone bezel-less increases the production cost, and I knew Xiaomi wouldnât waste resources on such features, but Xiaomi somehow managed to include a bezel-less screen among the other upgrades; Kudos to Xiaomi for it. The display is a 5.7-inch IPS LCD unit with HD+ resolution. The screen missies out on Corning Gorilla Glass protection, but during my usage, I didnât feel the lack of it. I dropped the device accidentally a couple of times on hard surfaces, and that too directly on the screen, but the display didnât break. Same goes for the scratch-resistance, the screen didnât pick any scratch even after two weeks of usage.Â  As for the quality of the display, it’s excellent. The first thing I noticed is how smooth the surface of the screen is; this usually isnât the case with other entry-level smartphones.

2241,32,/gear/2018/06/19/oppo-f7-review/,0,0,2018-06-19,oppo-f7-review, Rahul Srinivas ,Oppo F7 Review: Selfie Freaks Look No Further!,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/2018/06/19/oppo-f7-review/," A little over four years have passed since Oppo made its official entry into India with its first launch for the country – the Oppo N1. Since then, the company has managed to garner a significant chunk of the market share in the country thanks to a barrage of aggressive marketing campaigns. As of 2018, the company is a well-established brand in India and has a lot of fan following as well. Oppo’s most popular devices have been phones from its F-series range that came with excellent selfie capabilities. In this review, we take a close look at the company’s newest offering from its F series range, the Oppo F7. The F7 is an aggressively priced, selfie-centric smartphone that packs in great hardware. Let us find out of the handset is worth spending your hard earned money on. But first, let us check out what comes inside the retail packaging.  Phone Transparent Rubber Case Charger Charging Cable SIM Ejector Tool Earphones Quick Start Guide  The Oppo F7 is a handsome looking device. I found the handset to be better built than its cousin – the Vivo V9 – that was also launched at around the same time. The Oppo F7 features a premium looking body which incidentally, is not metal. The body is instead almost entirely constructed out of acrylic plastic. Thanks to this, while the phone doesn’t feel as premium to the touch as a metallic phone would, it feels much better than a handset that has a plastic body. The rear panel also gets a glossy finish that adds to the premium touch – while also making the handset a fingerprint magnet. I particularly liked how Oppo made the rear panel, glossy without it being overly reflective. One gripe I had with the device was how easily I managed to stain the handset. If you happen to be a rough user like me, it is advisable that you get a good case to use with the phone. Thankfully, Oppo does ship a transparent rubber case with the handset inside the retail packaging. On the flip side, even with this case, the handset did end up collecting a significant amount of dust, grime and spots even under the covered ‘protected’ back panel. This can, however, be fixed if you get a better quality case for the phone. Moving on to the other design aspects, the front fascia is almost completely encompassed by the large display except for a thin ‘chin’ at the bottom. The only ‘disruption’ comes in the form of the large notch at the top. Just above the notch are the front facing 25-megapixel selfie camera and the earpiece, along with the proximity sensor. The volume rocker buttons are located on the left side while the power button and the SIM tray are located on the right. The SIM tray is a triple slot that can take in two SIM cards and a microSD card at the same time. At the bottom, you will find the 3.5mm audio jack, the micro USB port, and the primary noise cancellation microphone along with a mono loudspeaker. There is a secondary microphone at the top as well. The F7 gets a very clean rear panel consisting of a single camera, an LED flash and the fingerprint scanner. There is also a prominent Oppo logo on the rear panel. While the phone does get a camera hump, it is very tiny and does not make the phone wiggly when placed on a table.  The Oppo F7 gets a large 6.23-inch IPS LCD display with a resolution of 1080 x 2280 pixels, thereby ending up with an unconventional aspect ratio of 19:9. The display was sharp, and the viewing angles were great as well. Legibility under direct sunlight, however, could have been better. Make sure you turn your brightness level to full before you go out in the sun. Considering the F7 has an LCD panel, I was surprised to see the black levels on the device which is only bettered by OLED panels. Colour reproduction on the device was fairly accurate with some noticeable bluishness on the whites. However, this was easily fixed by switching to a warmer colour temperature.   Being an Oppo, the F7 is very competent at capturing selfies thanks to the 25-megapixel front camera. That being said, the phone is not really a slouch either when it comes to the capabilities of its 16-megapixel, f/1.8 rear facing camera. The Oppo F7 is also very competent at ‘recognising’ objects thanks to the AI boost feature. As far as the camera UI is concerned, while fairly comprehensive, in case you are someone who likes to tweak around with the settings, the F7 does fall short. You cannot, for example, know the actual resolution at which you are capturing images with the only options being presented to you being ‘Standard’, ‘Square’, and ‘Fullscreen’. Video capture can be done at 1080p 30fps as well as 720p resolutions. Both the cameras support video filters and video beauty mode, but only in the 720p resolution. Coming back to still images, the rear camera also invites you to try out the 1X zoom which in spite of being digital in nature, worked fairly well in most conditions. You do get this zoom option even in the video mode. As mentioned earlier, you do get a fair bit of control while in the ‘Expert’ mode. The phone also features the sticker mode that lets you add funny stickers to your face. While it might seem gimmicky in nature initially, I must admit I did have a fun time using it. The 16-megapixel rear camera on the F7 is very good at capturing images during well-lit conditions. Images captured during sunrise and dusk also look great. While the dynamic range could have been better, the HDR mode can go a long way in helping you fix this. Images of foliage, for example, look great on the display but lack detail when you zoom into them. The handset, however, is great at landscape photography as long as you do not zoom into the image. I did manage to capture some excellent looking landscape images using the handset. As far as low light imaging is concerned, the F7 should on paper be able to capture excellent low light images thanks to its f/1.8 aperture. However, the lack of OIS almost negates the availability of this wide aperture. You will need to possess extremely stable hands to get a clear shot. Low light images also came out with a tangible amount of noise. The panorama mode is good when you have bright lighting conditions. Even with the single camera at the rear, the F7 does manage to simulate background blur thanks to Oppo’s expertise with selfies. The front shooter, however, is more capable of the two as far as background blur is concerned. Being an Oppo, the F7 features a high resolution, 25-megapixel front snapper. And while the front shooter lacks autofocus, it is great at what it is advertised for. One issue that I noted, however, was that the focus wasn’t great when you use the phone with a selfie stick. The phone supports HDR in the selfie mode as well which I recommend keeping on all the time as it improves the dynamic range on all selfies. In case you are the kind who shares a lot of selfies on Facebook or Instagram, the Oppo F7 should be the perfect tool for you. Do not, however, expect great details from the camera in case you wish to view them at 100% crop on your computer screen. Background blur is great even without a secondary front camera. You will also have a lot of fun with the stickers feature. Even I was hooked! The Oppo F7 runs Android 8.1 Oreo underneath the heavily customized Color OS UI. The F7 also runs the latest version of Color OS (version 5), and the biggest addition to it happens to be the enhanced AI engine. This lets the handset handle tasks like face unlock, facial and object recognition with relative ease. While not full of bloatware, the F7 does come with a fair share of preinstalled apps. Apart from the GSuite bundle, you also get Oppo’s own app store and its own backup tool as well as a bunch of productivity tools. In case you have used an Oppo before, the UI will feel familiar. Those of you coming from a pure Android UI will need some time getting used to the lack of an app drawer. I loved the lock screen wallpaper setup that has an automatic slideshow of images going on continuously. You can also customise this setup and have your own set of images show up here. The F7 supports theming, and you can choose from a host of downloadable themes and wallpapers from Oppo’s own store. In case you are not particularly fond of the default font, this can be changed as well. Color OS also supports the dual apps feature that lets users run two instances of the same app with multiple accounts. The Oppo F7 gets multiple security options to choose from – including the older passcode and pattern mechanisms. The phone also gets a fingerprint scanner which I found to be extremely fast. Face Unlock feature is also available and it is as quick as the ones I found on more expensive handsets.  Thanks to the presence of the notch at the top, and the fact that the aspect ratio of the display is an unconventional 19:9, you get the option to turn the notch off for apps that have important aspects hidden behind the notch. There is also a full-screen mode option for apps that make use of the taller display. I did not, however, find an option to turn the notch off completely.   In the one month that I used the Oppo F7 as my primary smartphone, I managed to fill the entire 64GB of internal storage. I did not, however, face an issue with the phone slowing down to a halt. This was largely due to the ample 4GB of RAM, and the excellent Mediatek Helio P60 SoC. The P60 houses an octa core processor consisting of 4X Arm Cortex A73 and 4X Arm Cortex A53 cores. The graphics is handled by the Mali G-72 MP3 GPU which lets the phone handle even heavy games with relative ease. You might experience an occasional frame drops, though. As mentioned already, I did not manage to slow the handset down even after almost entirely filling up the internal storage. I might need to use the phone for a couple of months more to see if I do manage to slow it down. The 3,400 mAh battery inside the Oppo F7 does not support fast charging. It took a little over 2 hours to charge the handset from 0 to 100 per cent. As far as battery life is concerned, I consistently managed to use the phone for well over 1.5 days after a complete charge. I was not able to get the actual screen on time since both Oppo and Vivo does not provide this detail within the battery stats settings. All said and done; you can easily trust the F7 to last an entire day even with moderate amount of gaming at 70% brightness.    The Oppo F7 is the first Oppo smartphone that I have reviewed. Until now, I believed that Oppo made overpriced devices that aren’t really “up there” when it comes to performance. While I am not sure about how things were earlier, the F7 with Color OS 5.0 and the excellent Mediatek P60 chipset definitely proved me wrong. I will totally recommend the F7 in case you are looking for a decently powerful handset with excellent selfie capturing abilities. On the flip side, I would also want Oppo to fix a few issues to make the F7 an all rounded package. Firstly, the rear camera could have been slightly better and should have taken better low light images with its f/1.8 lens. Secondly, the device could have been a bit more premium with a metal body instead of the current plastic body. The F7 is offered in a base 4GB + 64GB and a pricier 6GB + 128GB version and to be honest; I was pretty happy with the 4GB version. At Rs. 21,990, the base version is actually a good purchase. Competition comes in the form of the Moto X4 and the Vivo V9.  Vivo V9 Review: ‘Notch’ Without Its Flaws While I will choose the Oppo F7 over the V9 any day, the Moto X4 does have a more premium build and better imaging (rear camera) and video capabilities. If you are a selfie freak, however, I am sure you will totally dig the Oppo F7. "
2419,32,/gear/2018/06/29/xiaomi-redmi-y2-review-sheep-sheeps-clothing/,0,0,2018-06-29,xiaomi-redmi-y2-review-sheep-sheeps-clothing, Awad Ballaith ,Xiaomi Redmi Y2 Review: A Sheep in Sheep’s Clothing,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/2018/06/29/xiaomi-redmi-y2-review-sheep-sheeps-clothing/," Xiaomi has been ruling the budget smartphone market in India with some attractive offerings that give you a lot more than what you paid for. It is certainly a hard task to upgrade the internal specs of a phone lineup each year and try to keep the price close to the previous model. Xiaomi claims to have done just that with the Redmi Y2. The phone isn’t an exact successor to the Redmi Y1 (review) though, as both phones are rebranded versions of smartphones from different line-ups thrown into the mix for Indian customers. Be that as it may, Xiaomi is pushing the Redmi Y2 as an offering for selfie enthusiasts. The company refers to the contraption as a “smartphone designed for the youth”, that, “comes with a selfie camera designed to capture you at your best.” Can the phone live up to this hype? I used the phone for well over two weeks to give it a fair chance and see if it really is worth getting excited about. Xiaomi follows through with its tried and tested design language on the Redmi Y2. This look is very reminiscent of other well-known phones from the Chinese OEM such as the Redmi Note 5 and Note 5 Pro. The vertically mounted rear camera at the top left of the phone cements that notion. Xiaomi certainly tried to make the phone look more premium than it actually is by giving it a metallic finish. However, even holding the phone in your hand for a second will make its plastic construction discernible. This isn’t as flimsy as its predecessor, but the build quality wasn’t overly impressive either. Within a similar form factor as its predecessor, the Redmi Y2 houses a 5.99-inch screen with the help of slightly reduced bezels. These aren’t the thinnest I’ve seen, but they do aid in keeping with the 18:9 aspect ratio display trend. The front camera and selfie flash are housed in the top bezel with the earpiece in the middle. The top is where we find the 3.5mm headphone jack and an IR blaster. The volume rockers and power button are to the right of the phone. They have a distinct protrusion and enough tactile feedback that differentiating between them wasn’t difficult. The left side is where you find the dual SIM + microSD card slot. The base of the phone houses the micro USB charging port with two speaker grills on either side. The bottom grills are deceiving as only the right one is an actual speaker while the one on the left is just for show. Another deception is with the antenna bands around the top and bottom of the device. The placement of the bands is the same as the ones found on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, with the only difference being that there are dual lines on the top and bottom of the Redmi Y2. Having even one line was unnecessary as this is a plastic phone and it is clear that the move was purely for aesthetics. The overall build of the phone is acceptable given its low price tag. With that said, there isn’t anything special about it as it feels plasticky and I did hear some creaks from the phone’s chassis from time to time. Furthermore, as is the case with many cheap devices, the screen protrudes from the frame. The edges of the phone are also at a steep curve, which some might find unpleasant to hold. The phone is still usable, and the included transparent case can come in handy for some additional grip and scuff resistance.  The Redmi Y2 comes with a 5.99-inch display which has an 18:9 aspect ratio. The LCD screen was quite enjoyable to use at it has a decent colour reproduction. It also gets bright enough to use in direct sunlight. However, having an HD+ 720p resolution screen did end up being a noticeable compromise. There was also an issue I faced with the auto-brightness mechanism of the phone. It would occasionally crank up the brightness too much or not change it at all. Other than these two concerns, the display is fairly usable and would be enough for general use.  Coming to the most publicised aspect of this phone, we have a 16MP selfie camera at the front which has an LED flash accompanying it for better low light photography. The back has a 12MP + 5MP configuration with all the expected bells and whistles such as portrait mode and HDR. The UI of the camera app is fairly intuitive and has all the main toggles at useable locations. Both the front and rear cameras get toggles for auto-HDR which does come in handy. There is also an HTT mode which will take multiple shots in low light scenarios to merge them and reduce noise. When it came to the actual performance, the rear camera was capable of decent photography when the lighting conditions were favourable. The photos are slightly on the darker side though, and the auto-focus takes a while to grab the subject. The rear camera portrait mode also faced some challenges as the image processing takes some time. Low-light was another problem as the images ended up very noise and lacked detail. Then we have the 16MP selfie shooter which ended up taking slightly better images. You need a steady hand with both setups regardless as there isn’t a lot of inbuilt stability. However, you can get reasonably good selfies without too much effort. Furthermore, Xiaomi has equipped the Y2 with reliable machine learning for reasonably accurate edge detection for portrait selfies. The front LED flash does help in dark situations but does not capture the same amount of detail as natural light. I did not have high expectations given the price and seemingly overhyped marketing of the Redmi Y2’s cameras. However, the resulting images are surprisingly good with all things considered. Being able to take those pictures was the challenge as the phone relies heavily on post-processing to get them right. The camera app will actually portray a complete disaster before clicking the shutter button. Trying to take consecutive shots was also tricky as the app took considerable time to recover after snapping the previous shot. I would still say that the end result is good enough if you can manage the slightly laggy camera app.  The Redmi Y2 comes equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor. This is an octa-core CPU which clocks up to 2 GHz. The phone does come with the latest Android 8.1 Oreo installed out-of-the-box, but there is the heavy MIUI skin on top. There are two variants of the device where the base model has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. For Rs.3,000 more you can get the 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage variant. It was a bit odd when Xiaomi announced they were using a 2016 SoC on its 2018 smartphone. I’m not sure if it was the fault of the CPU, software, or a combination of both, but I experienced considerable stuttering and lag when using the phone. The base UI is smooth enough, and apps perform acceptably on their own. The problems mostly arise when trying to move between applications. Gestures and taps (for interfaces such as the on-screen home button) sometimes fail to register. The phone never crashed entirely for me, but the overall navigation was slightly sluggish. It is still a powerful enough CPU, but don’t expect to be blown away by the performance. The Redmi Y2 comes with two main security features. You do get the traditional fingerprint scanner at the rear, while the front camera is capable of ‘Face Unlock’. The fingerprint scanner will perform consistently while the face detection will be a hit or miss ordeal. Half of the time, the face unlock worked incredibly well even in challenging lighting scenarios. The rest of the time, it would either be really slow or just fail entirely. Since there isn’t any dedicated hardware for face unlock on this budget phone, and the fact that the phone itself will throw a disclaimer at setup to let you know that this feature isn’t as secure as its alternatives, the feature simply becomes a bonus at this point. Coming to the audio capabilities, the phone has just one loudspeaker unit at the bottom. The dummy grill to the left of the charging port is not entirely useless as it does house the microphone. The earpiece at the top does not double as a loudspeaker. Its volume level and clarity are adequate for calls. As for the loudspeaker, it is one of the louder ones I have experienced compared to other bottom firing units and did not present any noticeable distortions at full volume. However, the audio output from the Y2’s 3.5mm jack was quite unsatisfactory. By default, the tonal accuracy was way off and the overall output was quite flat. MIUI does have equaliser settings, but you are forced to use presets only for Xiaomi headphones. It became difficult using headphones from other manufacturers as none of these presets worked in reproducing their natural sound profile.  As mentioned earlier, the Redmi Y2 comes with Android 8.1 Oreo out-of-the-box with Xiaomi’s custom MIUI 9.5 skin on top. Anyone who may have used any Xiaomi product will be aware of the obvious iOS-inspired theme of this UI. The software has come a long way from what it was on older phones and offers a relatively clean interface. Needless to say, Android purists will face some issues but getting used to the UI doesn’t take that long. There is considerable bloatware preloaded on this phone. Other than the mandatory Xiaomi system applications, however, many of the other can be deleted. Then we have the actual interface where some customisability is possible with the included themes app. You still won’t be able to get an app drawer but will be able to change the icons, font style, lock screen style etc. with the app. The default navigation system on the phone uses software button which can be replaced with iPhone X-like gestures. There is also the option of enabling a quick ball floating widget for navigation which can be dragged around the screen for comfortable access. I ended up using the standard on-screen navigation buttons for most of my time with the phone. In addition to the intermittent stuttering and lagging issues mentioned earlier, there were a few other UI annoyances which could be chalked up to a collective software bug. One such example is where expanding the notifications became problematic. The UI would constantly mistake my drag gesture on the notification and expand the shortcut toggle menu instead. I did finally receive a software update for the MIUI build 9.5.14 (from previous MIUI version 9.5.9), but that update was just for some camera performance bug. I’m not sure what it fixed as the camera app still performed exactly the same, and none of my other concerns were addressed.  Fuelling the Redmi Y2 is a 3080mAh capacity battery which performed considerably well. There is a smart ‘Sleep mode’ in this device which will help shut down background activity such as Bluetooth, GPS, mobile data and Wi-Fi usage when the phone remains inactive for a certain duration. My first day of use with the mode disabled gave me about 5:30 hours of screen-on time with 30 hours of backup. With the mode enabled, I was easily able to push the screen-on time to over 7 hours with almost 40 hours of standby time. Depending on your usage, the battery life is the one aspect which has the potential to be exceptional. There will be some drain overnight though, but keeping the phone plugged in for a couple of hours tops it up entirely. I comfortably used the phone during the day and plugged it up at night before going to bed.  On paper, the Redmi Y2 seemed promising considering its price point relative to its specifications. The main selling point is supposed to be the camera, and it actually isn’t too bad. The battery life is also good for a day’s worth of use. However, minor annoyances, such as the on-screen home button failing intermittently for one, make the overall experience unsatisfactory. Furthermore, glaring optimisation issues manifest through occasional stuttering and malfunctioning UI elements, and the camera app itself is slow and unresponsive at times. Xiaomi knows how to make good phones at affordable prices. I don’t believe equipping a budget phone with a better camera in place of a lower resolution screen and dated Qualcomm chipset was the right move. Yes, the camera is decent and battery life is also above average, but the cheap build and inconsistent performance makes it hard to recommend the Redmi Y2 over other budget phones that are at least consistent in what they offer. Something more along the lines of the Redmi Note 5 Pro is where you can start seeing good smartphone cameras. If you cannot afford to spend that much, then better overall packages can be found with phones such as the Oppo Realme 1 (starts at Rs. 8,990) and the Honor 9 Lite (starts at Rs. 10,999)."
2419,32,/gear/2018/06/29/xiaomi-redmi-y2-review-sheep-sheeps-clothing/,0,0,2018-06-29,xiaomi-redmi-y2-review-sheep-sheeps-clothing, Awad Ballaith ,Xiaomi Redmi Y2 Review: A Sheep in Sheep’s Clothing,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/2018/06/29/xiaomi-redmi-y2-review-sheep-sheeps-clothing/," Xiaomi has been ruling the budget smartphone market in India with some attractive offerings that give you a lot more than what you paid for. It is certainly a hard task to upgrade the internal specs of a phone lineup each year and try to keep the price close to the previous model. Xiaomi claims to have done just that with the Redmi Y2. The phone isn’t an exact successor to the Redmi Y1 (review) though, as both phones are rebranded versions of smartphones from different line-ups thrown into the mix for Indian customers. Be that as it may, Xiaomi is pushing the Redmi Y2 as an offering for selfie enthusiasts. The company refers to the contraption as a “smartphone designed for the youth”, that, “comes with a selfie camera designed to capture you at your best.” Can the phone live up to this hype? I used the phone for well over two weeks to give it a fair chance and see if it really is worth getting excited about. Xiaomi follows through with its tried and tested design language on the Redmi Y2. This look is very reminiscent of other well-known phones from the Chinese OEM such as the Redmi Note 5 and Note 5 Pro. The vertically mounted rear camera at the top left of the phone cements that notion. Xiaomi certainly tried to make the phone look more premium than it actually is by giving it a metallic finish. However, even holding the phone in your hand for a second will make its plastic construction discernible. This isn’t as flimsy as its predecessor, but the build quality wasn’t overly impressive either. Within a similar form factor as its predecessor, the Redmi Y2 houses a 5.99-inch screen with the help of slightly reduced bezels. These aren’t the thinnest I’ve seen, but they do aid in keeping with the 18:9 aspect ratio display trend. The front camera and selfie flash are housed in the top bezel with the earpiece in the middle. The top is where we find the 3.5mm headphone jack and an IR blaster. The volume rockers and power button are to the right of the phone. They have a distinct protrusion and enough tactile feedback that differentiating between them wasn’t difficult. The left side is where you find the dual SIM + microSD card slot. The base of the phone houses the micro USB charging port with two speaker grills on either side. The bottom grills are deceiving as only the right one is an actual speaker while the one on the left is just for show. Another deception is with the antenna bands around the top and bottom of the device. The placement of the bands is the same as the ones found on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, with the only difference being that there are dual lines on the top and bottom of the Redmi Y2. Having even one line was unnecessary as this is a plastic phone and it is clear that the move was purely for aesthetics. The overall build of the phone is acceptable given its low price tag. With that said, there isn’t anything special about it as it feels plasticky and I did hear some creaks from the phone’s chassis from time to time. Furthermore, as is the case with many cheap devices, the screen protrudes from the frame. The edges of the phone are also at a steep curve, which some might find unpleasant to hold. The phone is still usable, and the included transparent case can come in handy for some additional grip and scuff resistance.  The Redmi Y2 comes with a 5.99-inch display which has an 18:9 aspect ratio. The LCD screen was quite enjoyable to use at it has a decent colour reproduction. It also gets bright enough to use in direct sunlight. However, having an HD+ 720p resolution screen did end up being a noticeable compromise. There was also an issue I faced with the auto-brightness mechanism of the phone. It would occasionally crank up the brightness too much or not change it at all. Other than these two concerns, the display is fairly usable and would be enough for general use.  Coming to the most publicised aspect of this phone, we have a 16MP selfie camera at the front which has an LED flash accompanying it for better low light photography. The back has a 12MP + 5MP configuration with all the expected bells and whistles such as portrait mode and HDR. The UI of the camera app is fairly intuitive and has all the main toggles at useable locations. Both the front and rear cameras get toggles for auto-HDR which does come in handy. There is also an HTT mode which will take multiple shots in low light scenarios to merge them and reduce noise. When it came to the actual performance, the rear camera was capable of decent photography when the lighting conditions were favourable. The photos are slightly on the darker side though, and the auto-focus takes a while to grab the subject. The rear camera portrait mode also faced some challenges as the image processing takes some time. Low-light was another problem as the images ended up very noise and lacked detail. Then we have the 16MP selfie shooter which ended up taking slightly better images. You need a steady hand with both setups regardless as there isn’t a lot of inbuilt stability. However, you can get reasonably good selfies without too much effort. Furthermore, Xiaomi has equipped the Y2 with reliable machine learning for reasonably accurate edge detection for portrait selfies. The front LED flash does help in dark situations but does not capture the same amount of detail as natural light. I did not have high expectations given the price and seemingly overhyped marketing of the Redmi Y2’s cameras. However, the resulting images are surprisingly good with all things considered. Being able to take those pictures was the challenge as the phone relies heavily on post-processing to get them right. The camera app will actually portray a complete disaster before clicking the shutter button. Trying to take consecutive shots was also tricky as the app took considerable time to recover after snapping the previous shot. I would still say that the end result is good enough if you can manage the slightly laggy camera app.  The Redmi Y2 comes equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor. This is an octa-core CPU which clocks up to 2 GHz. The phone does come with the latest Android 8.1 Oreo installed out-of-the-box, but there is the heavy MIUI skin on top. There are two variants of the device where the base model has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. For Rs.3,000 more you can get the 4GB of RAM and 64GB storage variant. It was a bit odd when Xiaomi announced they were using a 2016 SoC on its 2018 smartphone. I’m not sure if it was the fault of the CPU, software, or a combination of both, but I experienced considerable stuttering and lag when using the phone. The base UI is smooth enough, and apps perform acceptably on their own. The problems mostly arise when trying to move between applications. Gestures and taps (for interfaces such as the on-screen home button) sometimes fail to register. The phone never crashed entirely for me, but the overall navigation was slightly sluggish. It is still a powerful enough CPU, but don’t expect to be blown away by the performance. The Redmi Y2 comes with two main security features. You do get the traditional fingerprint scanner at the rear, while the front camera is capable of ‘Face Unlock’. The fingerprint scanner will perform consistently while the face detection will be a hit or miss ordeal. Half of the time, the face unlock worked incredibly well even in challenging lighting scenarios. The rest of the time, it would either be really slow or just fail entirely. Since there isn’t any dedicated hardware for face unlock on this budget phone, and the fact that the phone itself will throw a disclaimer at setup to let you know that this feature isn’t as secure as its alternatives, the feature simply becomes a bonus at this point.

2282,32,/gear/2018/08/16/honor-9n-review-modest-upgrade-honor-9-lite/,0,0,2018-08-16,honor-9n-review-modest-upgrade-honor-9-lite, Awad Ballaith ,Honor 9N Review: A Modest Upgrade Over the Honor 9 Lite,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/2018/08/16/honor-9n-review-modest-upgrade-honor-9-lite/," Honor hit it out of the park when it came out with the Honor 9 Lite earlier this year. In our review, we noted how the phone was a great all-rounder which provided flagship-grade looks at an extremely affordable price tag. The Huawei sub-brand decided to take it a ‘notch’ further by releasing an identical handset with some 2018 flair thrown in. And thus, we have the Honor 9N – another pretty smartphone that will not hurt your pockets. But is the marginally higher price tag justified for a smartphone which is basically the same as its predecessor, or are you better off just buying the older handset? Read ahead to find out. 1. Honor 9N 2. Transparent Hard-Plastic Case 3. SIM Ejector Tool 4. USB Micro-B Charging Cable 5. Huawei 5V Charger 6. Quick Start Guide/Documentation   We were already fans of the Honor 9 Lite’s look and feel. Other than the addition of the notch at the top, there isn’t anything that changes on the 9N. You get the same glass-clad back and front with an anodised metal frame holding the two panels together. For protection, Honor was thoughtful enough to provide a hard-plastic case which doesn’t sacrifice the aesthetics too much as it is translucent. The display panel Honor has used on the 9N measures 5.84-inches and comes with a Full HD+ (2280×1080) resolution and a 19:9 aspect ratio. The 79.5 percent screen-to-body-ratio achieved by this screen is a marginal upgrade over the 9 Lite’s 75.5 percent. Nevertheless, this is one of the better IPS panels we have seen on budget smartphones and will be serviceable for casual use cases such as watching YouTube videos and browsing social media. You can follow the link below for more insight into the performance of the Honor 9N’s display.  Those who are not accustomed to Honor’s EMUI experience might find using the Honor 9N a bit jarring at first. However, EMUI version 8.0 which runs over Android 8.0 Oreo by default on this phone is a highly customisable UI which allows a great degree of personalisation. There is a decent amount of bloatware that comes installed here, but many of these apps can be removed. For audio, the Honor 9N comes with the same bottom firing speaker we have seen on the 9 Lite. Unsurprisingly, the audio levels from both the phones are the same. As far as bottom firing speakers go, the one on this phone is loud enough for something like watching a movie in a quiet room. Try to do the same even in a moderately noisy space, and you would be setting yourself up for disappointment. The reassuring 3.5mm headphone jack would come in handy in such situations.  With its Kirin 659 chipset, the Honor 9N’s performance is on-par with most other smartphones of this price segment. However, this assessment is for the 9N’s base variant that comes with 3GB of RAM with 32GB of storage space and costs Rs. 11,999. Honor’s aggressive background app killing policy renders the additional 1GB of RAM useless on the 9N’s pricier variants. For a detailed rundown of the Honor 9N’s performance, click on the link below. Honor 9N Performance Review: Does More RAM Make A Difference?   In Honor’s attempt to reduce the bezels on the 9N, a notch had to be incorporated on the handset’s display. This consequently resulted in them fitting a 16MP sensor in place of the 13MP+2MP selfie camera setup used on the 9 Lite. Meanwhile, the rear camera still uses the same 13MP+2MP configuration on the 9N as found on its sibling. Our testing showed that both the front and rear cameras perform reasonably well in favourable lighting conditions. Low-light photography suffers immensely and results in noise and blurry artefacts. You can find sample shots along with our detailed assessment of the Honor 9N’s cameras by clicking the link below.  The battery life is where the Honor 9N leaves a bit more to be desired. The most we were able to squeeze out of this phone’s 3000mAh capacity cell was around 5 to 6 hours of screen-on time with 30 to 35 hours of standby. While not entirely awful, this wasn’t too impressive either and was marginally lower than what we experienced with the Honor 9 Lite. This phone still uses a micro USB port for charging, and you don’t find any support for fast charging either. Nevertheless, charging from 0-100% takes just over two hours. To push the battery life further, EMUI provides two power saving modes. The first one works by limiting background app activity, reducing some visual effects, and disabling some features such as email auto-sync and system sounds. Then we have the “Ultra power saving mode” which disables pretty much everything except essential phone apps such as the Dialer and Messaging apps. You have the option of selecting a maximum of six application that can run when this mode is enabled. Honor has followed the “if it’s not broke, don’t fix it” philosophy with the Honor 9N, and we don’t blame them for it. The phone offers a decorous collection of hardware in a package attractive enough that we almost overlooked its shortcomings. Almost. The battery life is strictly average, and the addition of the notch doesn’t really contribute to any functional perks. With that said, this notch doesn’t hinder the experience either and led to the integration of a better selfie camera on the 9N. We have no qualms recommending the Honor 9N to those who desire a good-looking budget handset with a reasonably balanced specs list. This validation is just for the 3GB RAM base variant as the higher memory options are unjustified in their pricing. As for the choice between the Honor 9N and the Honor 9 Lite, the only functional advantage the former offers for its Rs.1,000 premium over the latter is with its marginally better selfie camera. If that is not one of your primary concerns, you will be better off with the 9 Lite."
2450,32,/gear/galaxy-m20/,0,0,2019-03-18,galaxy-m20, Zara Ali ,Samsung Galaxy M20,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/galaxy-m20/," The Samsung Galaxy M20 is mid-range Android smartphone by the brand. It packs the right amount of rage that Samsung needs to survive in the competitive segment. The Samsung Galaxy M20 comes with a 6.3-inch full-HD+ Infinity-V display at 1080×2340 pixels resolution and 19.5:9 aspect ratio. The Infinity-V display denotes to a pin-hole at the top of the screen that houses the selfie camera. This design on the phone is to steer clear of the notch and offer better screen real estate to the users.  Samsung’s proprietary Exynos 7904 SoC powers the Galaxy M20 with Mali-G71 MP2 GPU and up to 4GB of RAM and up to 64GB of internal storage. The storage on the device can be further expanded up to 512GB via microSD card. On the software, the phone ships with Android 8.1 Oreo-based Samsung Experience 9.5 UX. For optics, the Galaxy M20 settles for a 13MP+5MP dual rear camera setup, wherein the secondary sensor is an ultra-wide sensor. On the front, there is an 8MP selfie snapper that supports Face Unlock. A 5,000mAh battery backs the Samsung Galaxy M20 with USB Type-C charging. The dual-SIM phone is also integrated with Widevine L1 certification, which enables it to play full HD and HD content on streaming platforms such as Netflix. There is a fingerprint sensor on the back.   Pros: The Galaxy M20 has a large screen, with minimal dot notch. There's a dual-camera on the rear and the phone lasts long, really long, on a single charge. The phone has a dedicated microSD card slot, a USB Type-C port, and a headphone jack.   Cons: The Exynos 7904 is slow for this phone's price, and the camera could be better.    Summary:  The Galaxy M20 is a fighting attempt from Samsung to stave off the competition. It has a large screen, a dual-camera on the rear, and a long-lasting battery. We are afraid, though, that it's not enough. The phone needs much more firepower in the processing department to keep things running on time.  The Samsung Galaxy M20 packs a 6.3-inch full-HD+ Infinity-V display at 1080×2340 pixels resolution and 19.5:9 aspect ratio. The near bezel-less edge to edge FHD+ screen on the phone offers users with the immersive viewing experience. The Infinity-V design is a smart alternative chosen by Samsung instead of a conventional notch that takes more space on top of the screen. The Infinity-V design is identical to the teardrop notch that we have seen on the phones like OnePlus 6T. The edge-to-edge design of the Galaxy M20 makes it look premium and enables more screen space for the users to watch videos and play games seamlessly.  Powering the Samsung Galaxy M20 is the company’s in-house Exynos 7904 processor. Based on the 14nm manufacturing process, the chipset boasts two 1.8GHz Cortex A73 cores six 1.6GHz Cortex A53 cores. The function of the two cores is to process heavy tasks such as gaming while the six cores are responsible for handling daily tasks like browsing apps and clicking pictures. Samsung has equipped the Galaxy M20 with a massive 5,000mAh battery, which is quite enough to run an entire day even on heavy usage. The phone comes bundled with a 15W USB Type-C fast charger claimed to deliver 3 hours of video playback on just 10 minutes of charge.  The Indian smartphone market has become home to a slew of worthy mid-range offerings from brands like Xiaomi, ASUS, Realme, Vivo, Oppo, Honor, and others. Earlier, Samsung was battling with its dipping share in the segment as it mid-range J-series was failing badly due to its mediocre specs. With the latest M-series, Samsung is back in the game. By equipping the Galaxy M20 with FHD+ screen, dual rear cameras, and a massive battery, it can expect a powerful comeback into the segment. Also, the pricing of the phone has also been done quite cleverly. With such improvements, we can expect the Galaxy M20 to be a success in the market. Samsung will also be benefiting from its goodwill and mighty brand name, which still matters to the Indian consumers.   "
2474,32,/gear/galaxy-s10-plus/,0,0,2019-03-25,galaxy-s10-plus, Babu Mohan ,Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/galaxy-s10-plus/," The Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus features a 6.44-inch Super AMOLED display with QHD+ resolution and HDR10+ video playback. It has a beautiful, glass-and-metal body with IP68 certification for dust and water resistance. The Galaxy S10 Plus has a 12MP+12MP+16MP triple-camera setup at the rear and a 10MP+8MP dual-camera setup at the front. The smartphone runs Android 9 (Pie) operating system-based One UI software and uses the Exynos 9820 processor. The Galaxy S10 Plus has at least 8GB RAM and 128GB storage. There’s a microSD card slot, too. There’s an ultrasonic fingerprint scanner in the display and stereo loudspeakers (with Dolby Atmos Audio). The phone has GPS, a dual-SIM card slot, Wi-Fi a/b/g/n/ac/6, Bluetooth 5.0, NFC, MST, USB 3.1 Type-C port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It is powered by a 4100mAh battery which supports Adaptive Fast Charge, Quick Charge 2.0, fast Qi wireless charging, and reverse wireless charging. Additional features include Bixby AI voice assistant, a heart rate monitor, Samsung DeX, and Samsung Pay.  Pros: The Galaxy S10 Plus has an excellent design, an almost perfect screen, stereo speakers, storage expansion, and a dedicated 3.5mm headphone jack. The smartphone also features one of the best cameras of 2019, offering HDR10+ video recording. Samsung has nailed the software design, offering extensive customizability and ease of use. The phone is fast and so is its ultrasonic fingerprint reader. Other nifty features such as Wi-Fi 6, Samsung DeX, Samsung Pay, Secure Folder, heart rate monitor, and wireless as well as reverse wireless charging make this phone a must buy.   Cons: Samsung's low-light imaging chops aren't the best in the market anymore. Also, the 4100mAh battery doesn't last as much as one expects from such a high-capacity battery. Moreover, Samsung needs to understand that 15W fast charging doesn't cut it anymore.    Summary:  The Galaxy S10+'s Dynamic AMOLED screen is second to none and the company offers various features such as HDR10+ playback, stereo speakers, and a dedicated 3.5mm headphone jack to make it a multimedia champion. The phone's rear-facing camera is excellent, except its low-light imaging, which is above average in comparison. The phone's performance is generally fast, but the Exynos 9820 throttles under continuous stress. One UI is the best custom Android UI and it offers extensive software features and UI customizability, without overwhelming the user. The phone's charging speed is too slow as per 2019 standards. Still, all things considered, the Galaxy S10 Plus is definitely one of the best smartphones of 2019.   The Galaxy S10 Plus is the first phone from Samsung to feature a Dynamic AMOLED screen. It’s basically an improved version of the company’s Super AMOLED panel with higher brightness, more color volume, and HDR10+ video playback capability. The 6.4-inch Super AMOLED screen is also the first phone from Samsung to feature a pill-shaped punch hole in its screen (at the top right corner), enhancing the visual content consumption and gaming experience on the device. The Galaxy S10 Plus’ screen has QHD+ resolution (3040×1440 pixels @ 522ppi), 19:9 aspect ratio, 88.9% screen-to-body ratio. The phone’s screen is covered by Corning’s Gorilla Glass 6 panel for scratch resistance.  Samsung has been using an aluminum-and-glass build for its Galaxy S series phones since the launch of the Galaxy S6, and the Galaxy S10 series is no different. The Galaxy S10 Plus uses a metal frame that’s covered by Gorilla Glass 6 at the front and the rear. Samsung has even managed to keep the 3.5mm headphone jack, which is still essential for most consumers. The phone is also IP68 certified for dust and water resistance, offering you peace of mind when you’re traveling during rain or are beside a pool at a party. Even with all these features, the Galaxy S10 Plus manages to look absolutely beautiful and premium. Its screen and the back curve towards the phone’s edges, blending seamlessly with the metal frame. Its corners are curved too, giving the phone a sophisticated feel in the hand. In India, the phone is available in three colors: Prism Black, Prism Blue, and Prism White.  The Galaxy S10 Plus is the first phone in the world with Qualcomm’s 3D Sonic fingerprint reader under the display. This new fingerprint reading technology uses ultrasonic sound waves instead of capacitive or optical sensors, which makes it more reliable even when there’s water or dust on the finger or the screen. Qualcomm and Samsung claim that the 3D Sonic fingerprint reader is more accurate compared to other fingerprint reading technologies.  Samsung’s Exynos 9820 processing chipset is used in the Galaxy S10 Plus. It is fabricated using Samsung’s own 8nm process and features eight CPU cores (two Mongoose M4 CPU cores clocked at 2.73GHz, two Cortex-A75 CPU cores clocked at 2.31Ghz and four Cortex A-55 CPU cores clocked at 1.95GHz), 12 GPU cores (Mali-G76 MP12), a 4G LTE modem, ISP, DSP, a dedicated NPU (Neural Processing Unit), and various wired as well as wireless connectivity features such as GPS, A-GPS, GLONASS, BDS, dual-band Wi-Fi 6 (a world’s first in any smartphone), dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n/ac, Wi-Fi Direct, Google Cast, Bluetooth 5.0 (with A2DP, LE, AAC, aptX, aptX LL, aptX HD, and LDAC), and NFC. Compared to the Exynos 9810, which was used in the Galaxy S9 series, the Exynos 9820 has a 29% faster CPU and 37% faster GPU. The base variant of the Galaxy S10 Plus has 8GB RAM and 128GB UFS 2.1 storage, which is plenty, no matter how heavy your usage is. There are two other a variants: 8GB RAM + 512GB and 12GB RAM + 1TB storage. If you want even more storage space, there’s a microSD card slot, which accepts up to 512GB microSD cards. The phone also features a USB 3.1 Type-C port for faster data transfer speeds and USB audio.  The Galaxy S10 Plus has two cameras at the front and three cameras at the rear. That’s one camera short compared to the Galaxy S10 5G. The Galaxy S10 has a 10MP+8MP dual-camera setup at the front to capture selfies. The phone comes with a Bright Night mode that uses multi-frame stacking technology for better images when there’s no light (at 0 lux). It also uses AI (artificial intelligence)-powered scene detection, which then applies the best possible camera settings for better end results. The 10MP sensor at the front has phase-detection autofocus (PDAF), f/1.9 aperture, and 4K video recording at 30fps. The 8MP camera sensor acts as a depth-sensing unit for better background blur effect. At the rear, there’s a 12MP+12MP+16MP triple-camera setup. The 12MP sensor has a wide-angle lens (26mm), f/1.5-f/2.4 dual-aperture, dual-pixel PDAF, 1.4 micro pixels, OIS, and 4K HDR10+ video recording. The second 12MP camera sensor is fitted with a 2x optical zoom telephoto lens (52mm) and has 1 micron pixels, f/2.4 aperture, autofocus, and OIS. The 16MP camera uses a 12mm ultra-wide angle lens, f/2.2 aperture, fixed focus lens, and 1 micro pixels. The rear-facing camera can also record 4K videos at a smooth 60fps rate. Samsung launched the Galaxy S10 Plus with Android 9 (Pie) onboard. The phone runs the company’s new, One UI software, which is designed from ground up to make it easier for one-handed smartphone usage. Apart from all the Android 9 goodness such as Digital Wellbeing, gesture navigation, notification channels, improved notifications, an auto rotate button in the navigation baar, dark theme, new emojis, and always-on display, the One UI also brings advanced features such as Dual Messenger, Samsung Pay, Samsung Pass, Secure Folder, and UI customisability (via third-party icons, themes, wallpapers, and group and video wallpapers).  The Galaxy S10 Plus comes with an built-in 4100mAh battery. It can be rapidly charging using 18W Samsung Adaptive Fast Charge or Quick Charge 2.0 (or newer standards) chargers through its USB Type-C port. The phone also supports Qi wireless charging (15W) as well as reverse wireless charging (4.5W). You can use the Wireless Power Share (reverse wireless charging) to charge either phones or compatible smartwatches and earphones. The Galaxy S10 Plus can easily last a day of normal usage.  The Galaxy S10+ is a huge upgrade over the Galaxy S9+ (Review), and it’s worth the upgrade if you have the money to splurge. The Galaxy S10 Plus has a larger and better screen, a faster processor, a better looking design, a faster and more ergonomic fingerprint reader, and a much longer-lasting battery. The ultra-wide angle camera adds a new perspective to memories and HDR10+ video recording makes you future proof. The only thing in the Galaxy S10 Plus that isn’t a huge upgrade over the Galaxy S9 Plus is its camera quality, especially still images.  "

2319,32,/gear/nokia-5-1-plus/,0,0,2018-12-28,nokia-5-1-plus, Alap Naik Desai ,Nokia 5.1 Plus,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/nokia-5-1-plus/," The Nokia 5.1 Plus is one of the latest launches by HMD Global in India. The phone takes after the Nokia 5.1 and is an upgrade over it in every aspect. The Nokia 5.1 Plus comes with a 5.86-inch HD+ display at 720×1520 pixels resolution and 2.5D curved glass. It is powered by a MediaTek Helio P60 chipset clubbed with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage that is further expandable up to 400GB via microSD card. The camera department is adorned with a 13MP+5MP dual camera setup at the rear with LED flash alongside an 8MP selfie snapper on the front. A 3,060mAh completes the package. Also, the rear panel houses a fingerprint scanner in the middle. Software side of things are handled by Android 8.1 Oreo, the Nokia 5.1 Plus is a part of Google’s Android One program that ensures timely updates for it. Priced under the mid-range, the Nokia 5.1 Plus rivals many smartphones on the market.  The Nokia 5.1 Plus price in India is Rs. 10,990. The phone is available in a slew of color options such as Gloss Black, Gloss White, and Midnight Gloss Blue.   Pros: The Nokia 5.1 Plus does a swell job when it comes to its software, all thanks to Google's Android One program. This also ensures that the phone will receive timely updates.   Cons: We think that the battery capacity on the phone is quite low when compared to the other phones in the same price range.    Summary:  The Nokia 5.1 Plus does a good job for a budget smartphone, but missed to get some shots. For the ones who want a phone with stock Android and zero bloatware, the Nokia 5.1 Plus makes the cut. However, for the heavy users, the battery could be a big setback.  Nokia 5.1 Plus is now receiving the Android 9 Pie upgrade, as HMD Global keeps its promise of the rollout within this year. The new firmware, with build number V2.09B, takes up 1.2GB, so you will need a full battery and WiFi connection for the download. The Pie update is official and comes with Android's December security patch. ...View more The Nokia 5.1 Plus falls under the 11K price bracket in India. Being part of the Android One program makes the phone even more worth a buy and that also assures absolutely zero bloatware. At its price range, the closest and perhaps the cheaper alternatives are Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro and the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1. Among the three devices, both the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro and Zenfone Max Pro M1 go with Snapdragon 625 and Snapdragon 636 chipsets, respectively. While the Nokia 5.1 Plus settles for a MediaTek Helio P60 chipset, which does not have as successful a record as the chipsets from Qualcomm. Another aspect wherein the Zenfone Max and Redmi 6 Pro go above and beyond the Nokia 5.1 Plus is the battery capacity. While the Nokia 5.1 Plus settles for just 3,060mAh battery, the Redmi 6 Pro boasts a better 4,000mAh battery, and the Zenfone Max Pro M1 emerges as the winner with its massive 5,000mAh battery. Although the Zenfone Max Pro M1 is not a part of the Android One program by Google, Asus has ensured timely updates for it. Under the camera segment too, the Redmi 6 Pro and Zenfone Max Pro M1 stand close to the Nokia 5.1 Plus. The Zenfone Max Pro M1 has a 13MP+5MP dual rear camera and an 8MP front-facing camera, which is same as the Nokia 5.1 Plus. The Redmi 6 Pro gets behind by just a minor difference as it packs a 12MP+5MP dual rear camera and a 5MP front-facing. Perhaps, the better value for money device than the Nokia 5.1 Plus is the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 with a better chipset, battery, and an equally good camera."
2267,32,/gear/nokia-6-1-plus-review/,0,0,2018-09-25,nokia-6-1-plus-review, Awad Ballaith ,Nokia 6.1 Plus Review: Nokia’s Foray Into The Notched Smartphone Era,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/nokia-6-1-plus-review/," HMD Global has been noticeably vocal regarding its plans to focus on the budget segment of the smartphone market. As a part of this effort, the Finnish company launched the Nokia 6.1 Plus, a device we were first introduced to when it came out as the Nokia X6 in China earlier this year. The phone offers admittedly mid-ranged specifications relative to its price tag of Rs. 15,999 in India. Android purists will also appreciate the fact this is an Android One device that offers a stock build of Android 8.1. With this combination, the Nokia phone happens to compete with the likes of the Xiaomi Mi A2, Redmi Note 5 Pro and Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1. Can the Nokia 6.1 Plus offer better value than its competition? Read ahead to find out. I used the Black variant of the Nokia 6.1 Plus for about two weeks to properly assess how the phone stands on its own. While the device does offer a dual-SIM hybrid slot, I used it in a single SIM setup on a Vodafone network in Hyderabad. My usual setup is comprised of 3 email accounts running alongside the usual collection of social media and messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Slack and so on. The device only offers a fingerprint scanner for biometric unlock, which I used as my primary unlocking method for the duration of this review. The 64GB of internal storage was also adequate during this time that I did not feel the need to use a microSD card. Nokia has acquired a reputation for building sturdy handsets. The Nokia 6.1 Plus is no exception and is certainly a marvel to look at. This is partly thanks to its large 5.8-inch screen that covers 81.5% of the front of the device. Then we have the sleek and glossy back that neatly houses the Nokia moniker, fingerprint scanner and vertically mounted rear camera in a straight line. Even with its predominantly glass construction wrapped around a smooth metal frame, the phone was easily able to survive a few drops now and then. However, there were a few scratches by the end of my time with the device. A standard case might be a worthwhile investment. The bottom is where we find a USB Type-C charging port just beside the bottom firing speaker. The right side is comprised of the power button and volume rockers. Both provide adequate tactile feedback while still being recessed enough so as not to cause any discomfort while holding the device. Moving over to the left reveals a hybrid SIM slot. This is said to support up to 400GB of additional storage with a microSD as long as you are willing to sacrifice the second SIM card. Thankfully, we don’t have to say goodbye to the 3.5mm headphone jack just yet as the Nokia 6.1 Plus houses one at the top. Overall, the device’s relatively short demeanour ends up being a godsend in this day and age of unusually tall phones. I had no issues in holding and using the device with just one hand most of the time. While there are certainly noticeable bezels at the sides along with a sizeable chin at the bottom, these end up helping with the ergonomics and prevent any phantom touches. The only real complaint I had with the overall design of the device is in the placement of the fingerprint scanner as it is located too low. The index finger doesn’t naturally fall there and needs to be bent each time the phones needs to be unlocked.  In my time with the Nokia 6.1 Plus, I was pleasantly impressed with the phone’s display. All in all, we get a 5.8-inch IPS LCD panel that sports a 1080 x 2280 pixels resolution, stretching the aspect ratio up to 19:9. No matter how you feel about the notch, there is no denying how refreshing it is to hold and use a bezel-less handset from Nokia for the first time. Content in full screen is unlikely to be obstructed anyway as the OS ends up adding a black bar on either side of this notch. While standard 16:9 aspect ratio videos do admittedly suffer when zoomed-in by having their tops and bottoms cut off, many movies and YouTube videos now come in wider aspect ratios that fit in very well. When it comes down to the actual quality of the Nokia 6.1 Plus’s screen, the LCD panel used here is one of the best you can find even on pricier offerings. This display is capable of exceptional white and black levels without any discernible noise. Colour reproduction is also surprisingly good across the entire spectrum. All this results in reasonably accurate colour reproduction along with sharp and detailed outputs. Being stock Android, you also get a modest array of customisation options for the display. These include adaptive brightness, night light, and the ability to adjust the font size and display element size. Furthermore, the phone offers ‘tap to wake’ along with ‘ambient display’. The latter feature especially comes in handy considering this device doesn’t have a notification LED. Finally, the display also offers a colour correction option for those who may suffer from one of the three main types of colour blindness (Deuteranomaly, Protanomaly, Tritanomaly).  The primary USP of pretty much all modern Nokia smartphones is the fact that they are part of Google’s Android One initiative. This results in the Nokia 6.1 Plus offering a clean and bloatware-free Android 8.1 Oreo OS running out-of-the-box. Using stock Android on this device is certainly an enjoyable experience. If you are accustomed to using heavily modified Operating Systems from other manufacturers, then the experience will undeniably feel barebones. But in this scenario, this is meant to be a good thing. The UI on the Nokia 6.1 Plus is similar to that found on Pixel devices. The notification bar and app drawer switch between dark or light themes depending on the type of wallpaper used. You do not get the option to toggle between the two. Furthermore, there aren’t any unnecessary apps to deal with, and the standard collection of Google apps should suffice for getting started. Nokia does provide one additional app called ‘Support’ that lets you monitor your device’s health, go through a user guide, check warranty related details, and even locate a care centre nearby. The actual experience of using an untampered ecosystem is meant to be liberating in the sense that users get to enjoy applications for what they are without having to contend with OS-related distractions. While the Nokia 6.1 Plus certainly exceeds in this regard, there are still some aspects of the UI that don’t exactly contribute to a seamless experience. One such issue, for example, is where applications in full-screen add a black bar on either side of the notch so as not to be obstructed by it, but the edges where the frame cuts off are straight while the base of the display is rounded. Then there is the recent “Notch Gate” fiasco where during the entirety of this review, I wasn’t able to black out the notch. While not a major issue for me personally, I understand the frustration of having the choice taken away.  The Nokia 6.1 Plus is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 SoC which is paired with 4GB of RAM. This chipset is quite capable of handling pretty much all of your daily tasks. Everything from unlocking the display to switching between apps is fairly smooth, with the RAM being sufficient for a good amount of multitasking. The lightweight operating system also ensures optimum utilisation of system resources. This can be felt while using and moving between the standard array of multimedia and social networking applications. Even the gaming performance was acceptable given the mid-range nature of this processor. Games such as PUBG and Modern Combat are certainly playable, as long as you are on lower graphics settings. Asphalt 9 fared a bit better with the graphics turned up, but a loss in frame rate was noticeable. On the other hand, less demanding titles such as Alto’s Odyssey perform marvellously. However, it is worth mentioning that the phone has heating issues which especially manifested while running demanding games. PUBG specifically caused the top half of the rear of the phone to get uncomfortably toasty. While the hardware limitations of the Snapdragon 636 are understandable, there are other performance inconstancies that are likely a result of the aforementioned poor software optimisation. An instance of this can be noticed when swiping down on the notification shade and being greeted with noticeable jittering. It became evident that this was an issue with the software and not the chipset when I turned on the ‘swipe fingerprint for notification’ feature, which resulted in near-perfect animation fluidity. Moving on, the fingerprint scanner itself functions very well. Registering a fingerprint on this device is one of the fastest I have experienced, with the detection being just as good. Furthermore, the bottom firing speaker is also one of the better ones I have come across. It gets reasonably loud without any noticeable distortions at max volume. There is a lack of base which doesn’t make this speaker ideal for music, but vocals from sources such YouTube videos are surprisingly clear and distinct. The headphone jack at the top of the device also functions as good as one would expect. Other than the ‘swipe fingerprint for notifications’ feature mentioned above, other gesture-based actions can be performed on the Nokia 6.1 Plus as well. There is the option to turn the device over to reject calls. Another feature automatically mutes the ringtone when lifting the phone to an upright position. Double pressing the power button from any screen can be assigned to trigger the camera app. Finally, there is the option to trigger ambient display each time the device is picked up.  Getting to the photography aspect of this review, we begin by taking a look at the dual rear camera setup. The primary lens measures 16MP with an f/2.0 aperture, which is paired with a 5MP depth-sensing camera with an f/2.4 aperture. This setup is capable of 4K video recording at a maximum of 30fps. While it does not offer OIS, you do get auto-HDR functionality along with dual-tone LED flash. On the other hand, a 16MP camera is provided at the front for handling selfies. Both cameras offer AI-assisted portrait modes (Bokeh). It isn’t entirely certain why Nokia decided to replace Android’s stock camera app with its own. This isn’t to say that its bad, as all the main options you need are right there at the forefront. A bar at the top houses toggles for flash, HDR, timer and beauty mode. There is also the option to enable both cameras and take “Bothie” images in either a ‘Dual’ or ‘PIP’ mode. While I did not find these options particularly useful, I suppose they are nice to have for those who may want to use them. Also, the Panorama, Bokeh and Manual modes are hidden away in a menu at the top left of the viewfinder. I was impressed by the imaging prowess of the phone’s rear camera setup considering the price bracket this device falls in. Images captured in daylight have surprisingly accurate colours and also seem to have a decent amount of detail. Zooming in on the images on a monitor reveals some loss in fine detail, but this is not going to be an issue for those intending to upload them on social media platforms. The Bokeh mode was also very good with acceptably accurate edge detection. The beauty mode on both cameras can be slightly excessive at its max setting but still does not make the image look overly artificial. Selfies taken from the 16MP rear camera of this phone are also just as good and detailed as the rear camera. The edge detection for Bokeh shots is also equally impressive. While not perfect, it gets surprisingly accurate results most of the time. Auto-HDR does come in handy on the front camera as much as it does on the rear. However, there were some instances where a weird halo effect was cast around the subjects in the frame. These were presumably a result of some issue with the HDR processing. When it comes to the low-light photography, the rear camera was not too bad either. While the images do lose a bit more clarity and detail, the noise reduction algorithm does a surprisingly good job. While I did notice some lens flare in such shots, they weren’t exceedingly bothersome considering the overall image quality. However, the front-facing camera fares much worse in this regard. The noise is noticeably more, and beauty mode fails to work most of the time. The screen flash was also not too impressive here. It is clear that imaging prowess of the Nokia 6.1 Plus is despite its inconsistencies in darker scenarios. However, it was the video capabilities of this camera that left me wanting for more. The device boasts 4K recording at 30FPS with its rear camera. Without the support for any sort of stabilisation at this resolution, videos are jittery and shaky at best. While 1080p video recording loses on the clarity, it offers gyro-assisted EIS that result in much more usable videos. Furthermore, there is the ability to record time-lapse and slow-motion videos. While the former can come in handy with a tripod, the video quality of the latter is abysmal and not worth using at all. Update: It was recently brought to my attention that the Nokia 6.1 Plus’s rear camera images end up with a yellow tinge when the flash is turned on. I hadn’t initially noticed this during my camera tests but I can now confirm that this certainly is a real issue which I was able to reproduce. While I still admire this camera’s overall performance, this issue does affect my final score.  Compared to the Nokia 6.1, the new Nokia 6.1 Plus barely gets an upgrade in terms of its battery size. The older device came with a 3000mAh battery while the new one comes with a 3060mAh cell. With continuous heavy use, I was able to get close to 6 hours and 35 minutes of screen-on-time while only being able to get about 15 hours of standby time. Lighter usage was able to give me up to 35 hours of standby time, with the screen-on time taking a hit down to 5 hours. The latter result was when I had the ‘ambient display’ feature turned on, and disabling it gave me half an hour of more screen time. You do get the ability to automatically enable a battery saver mode which is meant to push the phones life by reducing the screen brightness and cutting down on the animations. You can set it to auto-enable when the battery reaches either 5% or 15%. There is also the ability to manage which applications take battery resources in the background. Regardless, the most this device can do is offer a 1.5 day’s worth of use, and I ended up resorting to the practice of thoroughly using the device during the course of a single day and plugging it up every night while going to bed. Since charging is handled over the provided USB Type-C port with support for Quick Charge 3.0, it takes roughly two hours to entirely top up the battery after it has been completely drained.  The Nokia 6.1 Plus will be an excellent offering for those searching for a relatively well-balanced package. I appreciate Nokia’s care with the build and aesthetics of this phone. The phone’s display is by far one of the best I have seen at this end of the market. It offers surprisingly good camera setups at both the front and the back. While the battery might not be that impressive, it is still manageable for a full day’s worth of use. Even the overall performance of the device is commendable despite the plaguing software optimisation issues. Hopefully, these grievances can be resolved with the soon to arrive Android Pie update. When it comes to the competition, however, the Nokia 6.1 Plus is only Rs. 1,000 away from the Xiaomi Mi A2 which also offers an Android One experience while being powered by a significantly faster Snapdragon 660 SoC. Furthermore, you have the option of going with the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 (Review) if you wanted the same Android One experience paired with the Snapdragon 636 performance starting at just Rs. 10,999. Even the 6GB RAM variant of this phone costs Rs. 1,000 less than the Nokia handset, comes with almost similarly performing cameras, and offers significantly better battery life. My advice for potential buyers would be to either wait for Nokia to drop the price of its handset or go for it during some promo campaign where you can grab it at a reasonable discount. At its current price, the above-mentioned offerings from ASUS and Xiaomi offer much better value."

2490,32,/gear/realme-3-pro-review-take-note-xiaomi/,0,0,2019-05-04,realme-3-pro-review-take-note-xiaomi, Chandrakant Isi ," Realme 3 Pro Review: Take ‘Note,’ Xiaomi",https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/realme-3-pro-review-take-note-xiaomi/," Xiaomi has dominated the budget smartphone segment for quite a long time. Not that it hasn’t faced challenges from other brands. Take, for instance, last year’s Zenfone Max Pro M2 (Review), Honor 10 Lite (Review), and Realme 2 Pro. These were solid smartphones. However, let’s face it, none of these devices could outdo what Xiaomi had to offer. Things are a little different this year. For the first time, Xiaomi’s latest Redmi Note Pro has met an intimidating opponent – the Realme 3 Pro. We have already seen how this handset has made Xiaomi India quite defensive about its Note 7 Pro on Twitter. But, is the Realme 3 Pro just a paper tiger, or knows how to hunt down its competitor? Let’s find out. From the get-go, Realme proved its willingness to experiment with design. Its first phone featured a striking diamond pattern at the back. In the second iteration, Realme gave consumers more choice by offering a gradient option in addition to the diamond pattern. For the Realme 3 Pro, the company has gone with a trendy dual-tone gradient, which looks attractive. The phone also has an S-shaped pattern that looks very similar to the ripple design found on the Vivo V15 Pro. The company says that it has been inspired by a racing track’s curves. For the Realme 3 Pro, the company has gone with a trendy dual-tone gradient, which looks attractive.  The Realme 3 Pro is made from injection molded plastic. It is quite rugged and can easily withstand a few drops. However, its arch-rival Note 7 Pro feels more premium owing to its glass back. The Realme 3 Pro’s camera assembly has a metal accent surrounding it. Thankfully, the protrusion does not cause significant wobble when kept on a table. The fingerprint reader sits higher than it should have been, though. As a result, you have to stretch your finger a bit to reach the sensor. Moving onto the sides, both devices settle for a plastic frame. The power and volume buttons are also plastic and their tactile feedback is quite underwhelming. The front sports a large screen with a tiny dewdrop-shaped notch. It is less obtrusive than the large display notches seen on many expensive phones in the market. For a budget phone, the bezels are impressively thin, too. With a screen-to-body ratio of around 83 percent, the Realme 3 Pro is quite compact considering its screen size.    The Realme 3 Pro’s 6.3-inch screen offers rich colors compared to most LCD panels in this price range. The Realme 3 features a quality IPS (In-Plane Switching) panel. The 6.3-inch screen offers rich colors compared to most LCD panels in this price range. Packing in 2340×1080 pixels, this display offers an impressive pixel density of 409ppi. The screen gets quite bright as well. With settings cranked up, the panel retains legibility even under direct sunlight. The screen tends to lean on to the colder side. Thankfully, you can offset it using the color temperature settings. Thanks to the onboard ambient light sensor, the Realme 3 Pro fine-tunes the brightness levels on its own.  The Realme 3 Pro runs Android 9 Pie with ColorOS on top. I was never a fan of ColorOS, but it has improved massively in its sixth iteration. It looks neat, like stock Android UI, and also comes with a few additional features. Be it an app drawer or universal search, Realme has added a nice transparency effect to most UI elements. The notification panel is customized with large toggle buttons. The gesture navigation option works even when the screen is off. For instance, you can control music playback without turning the screen on. The best part is that unlike MIUI, Realme’s ColorOS never nags you with ads. Like every other Android device these days, the Realme 3 Pro offers split-screen multitasking. The task switcher has a card interface, which is quite like that of the iPhone. Realme has added a bunch of useful features such as the App Lock, Clone Phone, and Phone Manager. In addition to that, you get a few preinstalled apps such as DailyHunt, Webnovel, UCWeb, and Wync Music. Thankfully, you can remove every bit of this unwanted stuff. The best part is that unlike MIUI, Realme’s ColorOS never nags you with ads. Backed by the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 chip, the Realme 3 Pro runs quite smooth. This 10 nm processor ensures smooth transition effects and other animations. The chipset comprises of two performance Kryo 360 Gold CPU cores clocked at 2.2GHz and six Kryo 360 Silver CPU cores running at 1.7GHz. The Adreno 616 GPU exceeds expectations when it comes to gaming. It handles PUBG Mobile incredibly well. I could run the game on High settings without any sign of a slowdown. With consistent high frame-rates, the Realme 3 Pro gives you a high chance of making it to a PUBG Mobile match’s final circle. The company has also added the Game Space feature, which keeps nagging calls and messages at bay. It also ensures that games get as much as system resources as possible. With consistent high frame-rates, the Realme 3 Pro gives you a high chance of making it to a PUBG Mobile match’s final circle. For security, the Realme 3 Pro offers two biometric solutions. First up, the fingerprint sensor works like a charm. Its detection along with the screen unlock speed is impressive. The face recognition feature is equally quick too. However, due to the lack of a depth sensor, I don’t think it is very secure. The single loudspeaker on the Realme 3 Pro is a surprise package. It is insanely loud for its size, at least in its price segment. This power-packed speaker doesn’t even distort at high volume. In short, you won’t have to reach for your earphones to watch a few random YouTube videos. And for music aficionados, Realme has retained the 3.5 mm audio jack. With earphones plugged in, the phone’s output is quite good. Nothing out of ordinary, but then you get what you pay for. The Realme 3 Pro is a 4G VoLTE handset with dual-SIM support. For storage expansion, it offers a dedicated slot. Other features include dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.0, and A-GPS. During the testing, most connectivity features worked well except for cellular reception. But that’s because of Airtel’s horrendous network coverage in Hyderabad. The device sports a dual-camera in 16MP+5MP configuration. The Realme is equipped with the same primary Sony IMX519 sensor found on the OnePlus 6T (Review). It does, however, lose out on Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS). The camera UI could have been better. Especially, the AI mode is marked by an icon that looks like beauty mode. And a few modes are hidden behind the hamburger menu. In addition to HDR, the Realme’s camera offers a new Chroma Boost option that enhances light and color saturation.  Expert mode let’s play around with shutter speed, white balance, focus, and exposure. You can also enable the Ultra HD option that produces 64MP shots through multi-frame stacking and interpolation. This increases the file size from around 3MB to 12MB, but I found close to no difference in the image quality. Not sure why did they even bother putting it together (maybe to compete with Redmi Note 7 Pro’s 48MP resolution number *wink, wink*). It captures plenty of detail while keeping noise in check. The colors look nice and punchy. To get the best results without putting in a lot of efforts, simply leave the AI and Chroma boost options on. Point, shoot, and the Realme 3 Pro takes care of the rest. It captures plenty of detail while keeping noise in check. The colors look nice and punchy. If you are a purist type, you can dial down the AI enhancements. The Realme 3 Pro isn’t afraid of the dark either. For a budget phone, it produces great low-light shots with its Nightscape mode. The images come out well-lit and with plenty of detail. You can, however, notice the crayon effect around the corner in bad lighting conditions. But let’s be realistic, this is one of the best cameras in the budget category. Moving onto video recording, the Realme 3 Pro records excellent quality 4K videos at 30 fps. The amount of detail in these videos is quite impressive. Though due to the lack of OIS, the videos turn out to be quite jittery. To serve the narcissists, Realme has thrown-in a 25MP selfie camera. It performs quite well. There’s an elaborate beauty mode, which offers options such as skin smoothening, thinner face, smaller nose, and every other cosmetic surgery in a virtual sense. The Realme 3 Pro draws power from a 4045mAh battery. The company has bundled a 20W VOOC 3.0 charger. This chunky charger can fully charge the battery in just 1 hour 20 minutes. This makes the Realme 3 Pro the fastest charging phone in its class. Thanks to a power efficient 10nm chip from Qualcomm, the Realme easily last over a day. The only gripe here is that the device features a dated microUSB port. I’m wondering how many millions is Realme going to save by making customers put up with this inconvenience. Bundled 20W VOOC 3.0 charger makes the Realme 3 Pro the fastest charging phone in its class and it easily last over a day.  Yes, you should definitely consider the Realme 3 Pro. For months, Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 7 Pro (Review) was a no-brainer in the budget segment. Finally, it has met a worthy opponent. The Realme 3 Pro takes the Redmi Note 7 Pro head-on in all departments. The Realme phone offers sturdy build, impressive IPS screen, great cameras, and excellent gaming performance. With aggressive pricing, it challenges Xiaomi at its own game. It is difficult to choose a winner between the Realme 3 Pro and Redmi 7 Pro. However, if you are looking for a stylish phone, the Redmi Note 7 has an edge over the Realme 3 Pro. On the other hand, those into gaming are better off with the Realme device. While it is a tie on the hardware front, Realme’s ColorOS gives it a lead in the software experience. Not because it is superior to MIUI in terms of features, but the fact that it doesn’t nag you with annoying ads or push notifications."

The Redmi Note 6 Pro comes in two RAM variants. The base variant has 4GB of RAM, while the other variant has 6GB of RAM. Both of them have 64GB of storage. The device runs on Android 8.1 Oreo and the OS is customized with MIUI 10. The smartphone has a dual-camera setup at the front, as well as, at the rear. The front dual-camera setup has a 20-megapixel and a 2-megapixel sensor, while the rear setup has 12-megapixel and a 5-megapixel sensor. The Redmi Note 6 Pro is powered by a 4000mAh battery, and it has Quick Charge 3.0 fast charging.  Pros: The notched IPS display on the Redmi Note 6 Pro certainly makes it feel like a modern handset. It offers a reasonably sturdy build as well. The phone's cameras are excellent for the price, and its battery life is also quite competent. MIUI on this phone is feature-packed.   Cons: The Redmi Note 6 Pro is barely an upgrade over the Redmi Note 5 Pro in terms of its design. The notch over the display is too wide. Furthermore, the phone doesn't ship with a fast charger.    Summary:  The Remi Note 6 Pro is quite a reasonable offering in the budget category. Xiaomi has certainly made improvements on this phone compared to its predecessor, making it a worthwhile upgrade. However, the Note 6 Pro faces considerably intense competition now. A great alternative would be the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 with its premium glass sandwich design, a smaller screen notch, and a 5,000 mAh battery.  Redmi Note 6 Pro has been released in India. The successor to the Redmi Note 5 Pro would be on sale for the first time on November 23. Along with the discounts offered by the company on the first-day sale along with select banks, Reliance Jio has also introduced INR 2,400 cashback and double data offer with the Redmi Note 6 Pro. Users can also avail up to 6TB of additional data for long term pack worth INR 9,999 upon fulfilment of certain terms and conditions....View more Soon after the first sale post-launch Xiaomi has conducted a surprise sale for the Redmi Note 6 Pro at 3pm IST on November 23. The sale will take place on both Flipkart and Mi.com. Additional sales will also be held later in the same day. Xiaomi is offering an INR 1,000 discount for this day's sale. The company also revealed that the first sale witnessed over 6 lakh sold units....View more There is a buzz that Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi will release its latest offering from its note series, the Redmi Note 6 Pro in India before November 20, according to a press-invitation leak. Currently, the device is available in Thailand and will soon come to be so in Spain. The device will likely come in two storage variants and three color options with a starting price of INR 14,999. ...View more The Redmi Note 6 Pro is not a big upgrade over the Redmi Note 5 Pro. It brings only two significant improvements – a larger display along with the notch, and a dual-camera setup at the front. The display is 6.26-inches as opposed to 5.99-inches on the Redmi Note 5 Pro. The notched bezel-less design increases the screen-to-body ratio from 77.4% on its predecessor to a respectable 81.4%. The IPS LCD technology and Gorilla Glass protection over it remains unchanged. While the Redmi Note 5 Pro already had a great 20MP camera at the front, there is now a 2MP depth-sensor in addition to it to improve the portrait mode. Although the dual-camera at the front comes at the cost of LED flash (the Redmi Note 5 Pro has it); hence, the low-light images won’t be as good now.  The Redmi Note 6 Pro offers 12MP+5MP dual-camera setup at the rear, just like its predecessor. However, it now uses a newer 12MP sensor, which has a f/1.9 aperture as opposed to f/2.2 on the Redmi Note 5 Pro. This should improve the camera’s lowlight image quality. The Redmi Note 5 Pro did not offer 4K video recording, while its cheaper siblings had it, and the same continues with the Redmi Note 6 Pro. The device does not offer 4K video recording when all of its competitors have it. The lack of this is going to be a deal-breaker for some. The smartphone still uses the Snapdragon 636 SoC albeit everyone’s expectation of it packing a faster, Snapdragon 660 chipset. In Thailand, the smartphone is available in only 4GB RAM and 64GB storage variant. However, in India, the device comes in 6GB+64GB option alongside the 4GB+64GB model. The device comes with Android 8.1 Oreo topped with MIUI 10.  Powering the smartphone is the same 4000mAh battery that we’ve come to see across all Redmi Note devices in the past. While the Redmi Note 5 Pro had Quick Charge 2.0 fast charging, the Redmi Note 6 Pro has Quick Charge 3.0, which is even faster. The connectivity options remain the same. It offers dual-SIM card slot with 4G VoLTE support. There is dual-band Wi-Fi ac/b/g/n, Bluetooth 5.0, A-GPS, GPS, infrared port, and a 3.5mm audio jack. The device uses microUSB port, in the era where everyone else is shifting to USB Type-C port. Also, there is still no dedicated microSD card slot.  The Redmi Note 6 Pro goes head to head against the Motorola Moto One PowerÂ (Review), Realme 2 Pro, Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1Â (Review), and the Nokia 6.1 PlusÂ (Review). While the Redmi Note 6 Pro looks like a better package overall compared to the Zenfone Max Pro M1 and the Nokia 6.1 Plus, it will have a tough time to beat the Realme 2 Pro and the Motorola Moto One Power. Why? Because the Moto One Power has almost everything that the Redmi Note 6 Pro has, but it also comes with a massive 5000mAh battery, USB Type-C port, and 4K video recording. The Realme 2 Pro, on the other hand, beats the Redmi Note 6 Pro with its twice as powerful Snapdragon 660 processor, while having almost all the features of the Redmi Note 6 Pro except for its smaller 3500mAh battery. There was a time when smartphones from Xiaomi were way ahead of their competition, but that does not seem to be the case anymore. It looks like other brands are doing better than they used to. That or Xiaomi isn’t working hard enough. Either way, I think the Redmi Note 6 Pro isn’t the best smartphone in its price range. "

Similarly-priced smartphones from brands like Xiaomi, Honor, Motorola, Nokia, Realme, Asus, etc. perform significantly better in every aspect compared to the ones from Samsung. It has been really long since Samsung has launched an entry-level smartphone that is worth buying, and everyone had completely lost hope in the brand. Well, it looks like Samsung has come to its senses. The brand has now launched the Galaxy M10, which addresses most complaints people had with Samsungâs entry-level smartphones. The Samsung Galaxy M10 has a nearly bezel-less display with a tiny V-shaped notch. It features a dual-camera at the back, which has one camera with regular FoV and one camera with ultra-wide FoV. The smartphone is powered by the new Exynos 7870 SoC. The battery has a 3400mAh capacity, which is on par with other similarly priced smartphones. The Galaxy M10 also breaks the traditional Samsung design language with its all-new modern-looking aesthetics. In short, the Galaxy M10 has most of the features that other similarly-priced smartphones of 2019 offer. The Galaxy M10 has hardware that can give a tough competition to other smartphones in the price segment. In my opinion, the Galaxy M10 is undoubtedly Samsungâs comeback in the entry-level smartphone segment. All we have to see now is how well the brand holds up in future with its upcoming entry-level smartphones."
2461,32,/gear/samsung-galaxy-m30-review/,0,0,2019-03-31,samsung-galaxy-m30-review, Abid Iqbal ,Samsung Galaxy M30 Review,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/samsung-galaxy-m30-review/," Samsung made a comeback in the budget smartphone segment with the launch of the Galaxy M10 and the Galaxy M20 earlier this year. The brand aims to gain back the market share that it lost to the likes of ASUS, Honor, Realme, and Xiaomi in the entry-level and mid-range segment with its Galaxy M series smartphones. The company has now taken one more step in the same direction with the launch of the Galaxy M30. This new smartphone sits above the M10 and the M20. It costs INR 14,990 for the base variant and INR 16,990 for the top-end variant. Looking at the specifications, the Galaxy M30 offers almost everything that you would want from a smartphone at this price. Let us have a look if it performs as good as it looks on paper.  The Galaxy M30 has a plastic body, but the device still feels solid in the hand – just like a smartphone that features a metal body. The back panel is also made out of plastic, and initially, I thought that it would get scratched pretty quickly. However, to my surprise, the back panel resisted scratches very well. I used the Galaxy M30 without a protective case during my week-long review period, and the back panel survived with only a couple of minor scratches, which I think is totally acceptable. If you use a case, I am sure that the Galaxy M30 will stay scratchless as long as you have it. The Galaxy M30 is slim and lightweight in spite of packing a massive, 5000mAh battery, making the device comfortable to hold. The device fits snugly into the palm due to tapered edges and rounded corners. The buttons and ports are also placed ergonomically, making it easier to reach them. Thanks to this user-friendly design, the Galaxy M30 is easier to hold even for longer periods. Looks-wise, the Galaxy M30 isn’t the most attractive in its segment, but it looks pretty good especially because of its sleek design and a gradient color pattern on the back. Although the build quality and design of the Galaxy M30 are pretty good, they are still no match compared to the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro. The Xiaomi phone has better build quality, and it feels more premium in the hand due to the glass back panel. In my opinion, Samsung could have worked harder on the design and build quality of the Galaxy M30. While most other smartphones in the price range come with an IPS LCD screens, the Galaxy M30 features a Super AMOLED screen, giving it a huge edge over its competitors. The screen itself a 6.4-inch unit with Full HD+ resolution. The display features the same bezel-less design with a U-shaped notch that we saw on the Galaxy M20, due to which, the device looks modern. Moreover, the screen comes with Gorilla Glass 3 for impact resistance. Coming to the quality, the display offers a good amount of brightness, and the visibility under direct sunlight is superb. The colors are vibrant, blacks are deep, and the viewing angles are excellent. There is no doubt that the Galaxy M30 has one of the best displays in its price range. The Galaxy M30 is the first smartphone at this end of the market to offer a triple-camera setup. First is a 13MP camera with a conventional field of view, second is a 5MP ultra-wide camera, and third is a 5MP depth-sensor. The 13MP sensor has a decent f/1.9 aperture, whereas, the remaining two cameras have an f/2.2 aperture. Images captured with the 13MP camera in daylight conditions are bright and detailed. The dynamic range is excellent, and therefore, pictures taken in tricky lighting conditions come out very well. Unlike most other smartphones nowadays, the camera of the M30 does not boost colors, and thus the images may not seem very attractive. That being said, the colors are not dull. They are close to what you see in reality. In my opinion, the daylight image quality is on par with what you get from other similarly priced smartphones like the Realme 3, and the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2. Things take quite a turn when it comes to lowlight conditions. A lot of noise creeps in, and the amount of detail is below average. The dynamic range goes for a toss due which many details are left out. There is also a decent amount of lens flare, which make photos look ugly. The only upside is that the images are bright. Now, most smartphones (except the Redmi Note 7 Pro, with its Night Mode enabled) at this price range suffer from these issues, and therefore, there isn’t much room for complaining. The Galaxy M30 can also capture portrait images, courtesy of the 5MP depth-sensor. The portrait mode has a pretty good edge-detection, and therefore, the images feature an impressive background blur effect. The portrait mode, however, is not very useful in low light conditions, as the camera struggles to detect edges of subjects accurately. Coming to the ultra-wide camera, it comes handy in many day-to-day situations. Pictures taken in daylight have an acceptable amount of details as well as brightness. The dynamic range is pretty good. The colors appear to be slightly dull, but not too far from reality. Overall, you can capture some decent shots in daylight. The ultra-wide camera, however, is utterly useless when it comes to low light conditions, as the images neither have enough amount of brightness nor details. They also suffer from high noise levels. Moving on to the selfie camera, it is a 16MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture. This camera totally impressed me, as it captures bright, detailed, and vibrant selfies in daylight as well as low light. In my opinion, the Galaxy M30 has one of the best selfie cameras in its price range. The Galaxy M30 uses the new Exynos 7904 SoC, which has two Cortex-A73 cores for demanding applications, and six Cortex-A53 cores for lighter tasks. For graphics, the chipset uses Mali-G71 MP2 GPU. The Galaxy M30 has a significant performance bump compared to the older budget offerings from the brand. However, it still feels slightly sluggish as opposed to its competitors. Moreover, the performance is inconsistent. Sometimes the device feels quick, and sometimes it feels horribly slow. The Galaxy M30 also lags behind in the graphics section. The device is suitable only for lite games. The graphics-intensive games like PUBG and Modern Combat 5 stutter significantly on this device. If you are very keen on having fast performance, or if you game a lot on your smartphone, the Galaxy M30 shouldn’t be on your list. That being said, average users will find the Galaxy M30 decently fast. Coming to the software, the Galaxy M30 has Android 8.1 Oreo operating system. The OS is customized with Samsung’s Experience UI. This customization from Samsung offers a ton of added functionalities, and the UI looks modern, polished, and beautiful. In my opinion, the Galaxy M30 has one of the best software experiences in the price range. One of the highlights of the Galaxy M30 is that the device comes with a massive, 5000mAh battery. As a result, the device offers an excellent battery backup. In my usage, the Galaxy M30 usually lasted about 32 to 35 hours with 7 to 8 hours of screen-on time. This is on par with other smartphones equipped with similar battery capacity. If you are someone who needs a long battery backup, the Galaxy M30 will definitely fulfill your needs. What’s even better is that the Galaxy M30 features 15W fast charging. Therefore, the device, in spite of a 5000mAh battery, charges from zero to hundred percent in just 2 hours and 50 minutes. Moreover, the device has a USB Type-C port, which makes plugging and unplugging the charging cable more convenient. The Galaxy M30 features dual-SIM connectivity with dual-4G and dual-VoLTE. Unlike most other smartphones in the market, which feature a hybrid SIM slot, the Galaxy M30 has a dedicated slot for two SIM cards and a micro SD card – this is an essential feature for Indian consumers, and it gives the M30 an edge over its competitors. The Galaxy M30 has excellent network reception, the earpiece, and microphone work as they should, and therefore, people on either side of the call can hear properly. The smartphone has dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n/ac, making sure that it offers fast data transfer speeds. There is also Bluetooth v5.0 for future-proof connectivity. And as mentioned earlier, there is a USB Type-C port. The Galaxy M30 has a bottom-mounted loudspeaker. It has a decently high volume level, but the sound quality isn’t all that great. You don’t get enough bass (whatever is possible in smartphones), and moreover, there is a slight distortion when you crank up the volume levels. On the contrary, the sound quality from the 3.5mm headphone jack is excellent. It offers more than enough volume level and a balanced audio output (for a smartphone of this price). The Galaxy M30 comes with a rear-mounted fingerprinted scanner, and it is one of the fastest fingerprint scanners I have ever used on a smartphone. Even the fingerprint registration process is blazing fast – it takes just two to three swipes over the scanner to get your fingerprint registered. After using the Galaxy M30 for a week, I have to say, Samsung has finally made an impressive, affordable smartphone. This new device has a class-leading display, one of the best battery lives, and up-to-date connectivity options. The camera performance might not be the best in the segment, but it is for sure satisfactory. The device is noticeably slower than its competitors, but in my opinion, it is fast enough for most users out there. The only real drawback is that the device lacks behind in gaming performance. However, if you aren’t a gamer, this thing shouldn’t bother you much. All in all, the Galaxy M30 is a great smartphone. That being said, the Galaxy M30 in spite of having so many positives, is not as good as the newly launched Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro. The Xiaomi phone beats the Galaxy M30 in almost every aspect expect battery life. If you want the best smartphone at this end of the market, you should definitely go with the Redmi Note 7 Pro. However, if for some reason you don’t want to buy it or if you hate ad-filled MIUI software,the Galaxy M30 should be your next choice.

,32,/gear/xiaomi-mi-a2-review/,0,0,2018-12-19,xiaomi-mi-a2-review, Rushil ,Xiaomi Mi A2 Long-Term Review: When Just Good Cameras Aren’t Enough,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/xiaomi-mi-a2-review/," Xiaomi was known for offering phones with great specifications for the price, but fracturing the experience by MIUI software. Last year, the company took a step in the right direction with the Mi A1 (Review). The first Android One branded smartphone from Xiaomi proved that it can do software well, too, and the Mi A1 turned out to be one of the best mid-range smartphones of 2017. In fact, we called it a “Budget Masterstroke By Xiaomi“. This year, Xiaomi announced the Mi A2 with a price tag of INR 16,999. The Mi A2’s biggest competition at the time of its launch was the Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review), which is priced exactly similar for its 6GB RAM variant. However, things get really interesting when you also add the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M2, Honor Play (Review), Realme 2 Pro and the POCO F1 (Review) to the comparison. The Honor Play and the POCO F1 offer flagship-grade processors and 4000mAh batteries. On the other hand, phones like the Motorola One Power (Review), the Realme 2 Pro, the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 (Review), are priced lower but offer much larger batteries and competent processors. We’ve used the phone for months before writing this review. So, how did the Mi A2 hold up over the course of this time? Should you put your hard-earned money on this Android One phone? Let’s find out in our long-term review of the Xiaomi Mi A2. I used the 64GB storage variant of the Xiaomi Mi A2 for more than three months before writing this review. I was using an Airtel 4G LTE SIM card during this period. Generally, my usage included an uninterrupted connection to a Wi-Fi access point or cellular data. My everyday mobile usage includes a lot of social media, an hour or so of music through earphones, playing a lot of PUBG Mobile and using Google Maps for my daily commute. I used the phone at auto brightness settings almost all the time. 1. Xiaomi Mi A2 2. Soft Silicon Case 3. USB-C To 3.5mm Adapter 4. USB Type-C Charging Cable 5. Wall Charger Adapter (5V/2A) 6. Quick Start Guide/Documentation The Mi A2 is the most premium feeling phone from Xiaomi under the INR 30K mark. It has a beautiful unibody metal design with curved edges. However, Xiaomi has decided to keep the design too thin for my liking. The Redmi Note 5 Pro and even the Mi A1 feel much more substantial in the hand. The Mi A2, though, is pretty manageable with one hand, thanks to the thin profile and those curved edges at the back. One more quirk that you’re going to notice this a lot during your time with this phone is that the thin profile means there’s a huge camera bump on the Mi A2’s rear. The camera bump is not just disturbing when you place the phone on a flat surface, but there’s also that constant fear of scratching the camera module glass. Thankfully, Xiaomi has included a soft case in the box for the A2 and that does improve the situation by a lot by masking this bump. Also, a welcome addition is the IR blaster at the top, which means you can control your TV, set-top boxes and other appliances via your phone using the Mi Remote app. At the front, There’s little to differentiate the Mi A2 from any other Xiaomi phone of 2018. There’s an extra-tall screen, but there are still some bezels present above and below the screen. I’m not really a fan of designs where the power button and the volume rocker are on the same side of the phone, but once you get used to the placement, it actually makes your one-handed usage experience better. The Mi A2 measures 158.7×75.4×7.3mm, which is 3.3mm taller, and actually 0.4mm narrower than the Mi A1. One of the standout features in this price range is the inclusion of a Type-C USB port. However, with a good decision, comes a surprisingly bad one too. The Mi A2, for some weird reason, doesn’t come with a 3.5mm headphone jack. And that takes away all the positives from the build and design perspective. Another bummer for some would be the fact that despite having a dual-Nano SIM card slot, it doesn’t come with a hybrid microSD card slot, so there is no scope for memory expansion on the Mi A2.  Keeping up with the 2018 trend, the 16:9 aspect ratio screen on the Mi A1 has been replaced by a 5.99-inch extra-tall display with 18:9 aspect ratio on the Mi A2. It is the exact same panel which is used in the Redmi Note 5 Pro. It’s an IPS LCD panel and for the price, it offers great viewing angles and good color reproduction. However, the screen’s brightness caps out at ~400 nits and that’s a bummer, especially if you’re trying to use the phone outdoors on a bright sunny day. Otherwise, the screen is good for media consumption. The screen can go really dim and that’s great for night-time usage. The lack of a notch means you don’t have to worry about your content being cropped out. However, the Mi A2, like many other Xiaomi devices, lacks Widevine L1 DRM certification, which means that you can’t watch Netflix and Amazon Prime videos in Full HD resolution on this device. Overall, a little more brightness and this could have been one of the best mobile screens in this price range.  The Mi A2 cameras have been a hot topic ever since it was launched. The phone has a dual-camera setup at the rear, consisting of a primary 12MP sensor (Sony IMX486) acting as its main sensor, and it has ƒ/1.75 aperture and 1.25-micron pixels. The 20MP sensor (Sony IMX376) acts as a secondary camera, and it has ƒ/1.75 aperture and 1.0μm. However, Xiaomi uses the 4-in-1 pixel binning technique, which combines light and color information from four adjacent pixels to form one pixel, and the result is a brighter and better 5MP image. This image is stacked to the 12MP image from the primary sensor for a better end result. There’s phase-detection autofocus (PDAF), too, along with an LED flash to help in pitch dark conditions. The 20MP selfie camera (Sony IMX376) at the front has ƒ/2.2 aperture and it features the same 4-in-1 ‘Super Pixel’ pixel binning technology, promising 5MP images with good clarity. For the selfie lovers, there’s also a soft-toned 4500K LED flash at the front for conditions when there’s almost no ambient light. The Mi A2’s camera app is not what you’d get on a Pixel phone despite the Mi A2 being a device with stock Android UI. Similar to most other smartphones these days, there is a Portrait Mode for both front and rear-facing cameras. Other features include Face Recognition, AI Beautify 4.0, HDR Mode, and Burst Mode. The front-facing camera packs in some fancy stuff, too, and it includes AI-powered Beautify 4.0, HDR, AI-powered semantic segmentation, and face recognition. One thing that I didn’t like about the camera app is the settings layout. For some reason, the ‘Settings’ option in the Camera app directs to settings for just one particular mode that is currently activated. So let’s say, if you’re in Photo mode, you can’t see the video settings and vice-versa. The UI flow honestly takes some time to understand, and a couple of times, I lost myself navigating around the menus. The rear-facing camera also comes with a dedicated Manual Mode, which lets you fully control camera settings like shutter speed, white balance, exposure, and ISO. Xiaomi also lets you switch between the two lenses, which technically is supposed to help you in low-light photography. But in my usage, I found the Auto Mode to be much more suitable under all lighting conditions. The manual switching between primary and secondary lens is confusing and is buried deep down in the Manual Mode, and Xiaomi should have just added a simple toggle to switch between these cameras. The Mi A2 misses out on 4K 60fps video recording mode, but it’s unfair to ask for it from a mid-range smartphone when many high-end phones still don’t offer it. You can capture 4K UHD videos at 30fps, Full HD 1080p videos at 30fps/60fps, and also HD 720p videos at 30fps. There’s also an option to shoot time-lapse videos and slow-motion videos (720p at 120fps). The Mi A2 doesn’t feature optical image stabilization, so it has to make do with electronic image stabilization (EIS). Although, it’s only effective at Full HD resolution and it works properly only in well-lit conditions because the stabilization fails in low-light conditions; especially if there are moving lights in the scene. The Mi A2 performs exceptionally well in good lighting situations. The colors look nice, the dynamic range is wide for a phone in its price range and the camera manages to capture a lot of details. The Portrait Mode on this phone is fantastic, and the edge detection and bokeh effect are one of the best I’ve seen on a phone in this segment. Check out some shots I took from the Mi A2 rear cameras: I am a huge fan of the portrait mode on the Mi A2’s front-facing camera, and the AI Beautify mode works as expected. Skin tones and details in selfies come out just right. The dedicated selfie flash on the front camera ensures that even in the darkest of conditions, you can manage to click a well-lit selfie. Now, some samples from the front-facing camera: So overall, how does the Mi A2 camera perform? Well, it’s amazing. The front-facing camera coming really close to the cameras on much higher-end phones. The rear camera also manages to impress thoroughly, as long as there’s enough light. The only issue I faced in my usage was the low-light performance of the rear camera, specifically the secondary lens. When in Auto mode, the primary lens is used by default and it delivers good enough results on its own. However, when you try to use the secondary ‘low-light’ lens using manual mode, the results are somewhat noisy. Yes, the low-light lens manages to pull in a lot of extra light into the images, but that surprisingly ends up in adding a lot of noise. Apart from this, the Mi A2 cameras deliver superb results and it is one of the best cameras under the INR 25,000 mark right now. If you’re looking for better cameras than the Mi A2, I can only think of the ASUS Zenfone 5Z (Review) and the OnePlus 6 (Review), both of which feature OIS and are priced considerably higher than the Mi A2.  Powering the Mi A2 is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 mobile platform which is currently one of the best mid-range chipsets. Unlike most other smartphones in this range, the Mi A2 is being offered in only one variant: 4GB RAM + 64GB internal storage. When it comes to day to day tasks, the Mi A2 breaks no sweat, whether it is launching apps or switching between apps. The stock Android experience surely helps in keeping things fast and smooth. Gaming on the Mi A2 is great, too, with very little or no stutters during my time testing out PUBG Mobile and Asphalt 9. The Snapdragon 660 is a potent processor, and it beats the Snapdragon 636 (which is used in the Nokia 6.1 Plus, Motorola One Power, Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1, and the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro) when it comes to GPU capabilities. However, if you’re big on games like PUBG Mobile, it’s worth noting that the difference in performance between the Mi A2 and a Snapdragon 636 phone is minimal and limited to marginally better graphics rendering. If mobile gaming is your primary concern, you’re better off going for the Honor Play or the POCO F1.  The best thing about the Mi A1 was its clean and smooth software experience, and the Mi A2 carries forward that legacy. It is Xiaomi’s only Android One smartphone right now. Android One not only gives you a stock Android experience but also comes with a promise of faster software updates. The Mi A2 was launched with Android Oreo 8.1 but has already received the official update to Android Pie 9.0. There is hardly anything to point out in the software experience of Mi A2. Despite being a mid-range phone, it just flies through day-to-day tasks and stock Android continues to be the most fluid Android experience you can have on a phone. One thing that the Mi A2 misses out due to running stock Android is the fast Face Unlock feature. However, you can still set your phone to use your face to keep itself unlocked using Google Smart Unlock. There is a 3000mAh battery inside the Mi A2, which is small compared to many other phones these days. It typically lasted me through a regular work day. I was easily getting 4.5 to 5 hours of screen-on time on the Mi A2, which isn’t bad, but it’s definitely far away from being the best in this price range. Almost every Mi A2 competitor offers a higher capacity battery. The phone also misses out on the host of battery saving features that MIUI offers, but Android One does provide the standard battery saver mode. Despite being a budget offering, the Mi A2 comes with Quick Charge 3.0 capabilities and the Indian unit even features Quick Charge 4.0. But, there’s a loophole here too, as the charger which Xiaomi is including in the box is the standard charger (5V/2A). So you’ll have to buy a Quick Charge 4.0 compatible charger separately. The phone charges fast enough with Quick Charge 3.0, filling around 50% capacity in 20 minutes. It takes 1 hour 30 minutes for going 0 to 100 percent. The Mi A2 is a very good phone, featuring a solid design, great software, and some incredible camera performance. However, Xiaomi has taken some decisions with the Mi A2 that make it really tough to recommend as a worthy purchase. There is no 3.5mm headphone jack. You can’t charge your phone with the earphones plugged in. Moreover, there’s no microSD card slot, and the battery life on the Mi A2 is average. When the Mi A2 was launched, it was the only phone offering the Snapdragon 660 chipset under the INR 20,000 price bracket. However, we now have the Realme 2 Pro rocking the same chip at an even lower price. Even the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 make stronger cases for themselves, even though they pack the inferior SD636 processor, but they make up for it with their huge batteries, 3.5mm headphone jacks, and microSD card slots. Then we have the Motorola One Power, which offers Android One goodness and a mammoth 5000mAh battery that easily lasts twice as long as the Mi A2. The Mi A2 clearly outdoes all of these phones, when it comes to the camera. If you can look past the exclusion of the 3.5mm jack, expandable storage, and a bigger battery, the Mi A2 will keep you more than happy. If you’re one of those who need the best camera phone under the INR 25,000 budget, the Mi A2 is the clear winner for you. That being said, if you’re looking for a more all-round satisfactory experience, and cameras aren’t your only priority, I would recommend you to go with the Motorola One Power instead."
,32,/gear/xiaomi-mi-a2-review/,0,0,2018-12-19,xiaomi-mi-a2-review, Rushil ,Xiaomi Mi A2 Long-Term Review: When Just Good Cameras Aren’t Enough,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/xiaomi-mi-a2-review/," XiaomiÂ was known for offering phones with great specifications for the price, but fracturing the experience by MIUI software. Last year, the company took a step in the right direction with theÂ Mi A1Â (Review). The first Android One branded smartphone from Xiaomi proved that it can do software well, too, and the Mi A1 turned out to be one of the best mid-range smartphones of 2017. In fact, we called it a “Budget Masterstroke By Xiaomi“. This year, Xiaomi announced theÂ Mi A2Â with a price tag of INR 16,999. The Mi A2’s biggest competition at the time of its launch was theÂ Redmi Note 5 ProÂ (Review), which is priced exactly similar for itsÂ 6GB RAMÂ variant. However, things get really interesting when you also add the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M2,Â Honor PlayÂ (Review), Realme 2 Pro and the POCO F1 (Review) to the comparison. The Honor Play and the POCO F1 offer flagship-grade processors and 4000mAh batteries. On the other hand, phones like theÂ Motorola One PowerÂ (Review), the Realme 2 Pro, the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1Â (Review), are priced lower but offer much larger batteries and competent processors. We’ve used the phone for months before writing this review. So, how did the Mi A2 hold up over the course of this time? Should you put your hard-earned money on this Android One phone? Letâs find out in our long-term review of the Xiaomi Mi A2. I used the 64GB storage variant of the Xiaomi Mi A2 for more than three months before writing this review. I was using an Airtel 4G LTE SIM card during this period. Generally, my usage included an uninterrupted connection to a Wi-Fi access point or cellular data. My everyday mobile usage includes a lot of social media, an hour or so of music through earphones, playing a lot of PUBG Mobile and using Google Maps for my daily commute. I used the phone at auto brightness settings almost all the time. 1. Xiaomi Mi A2 2. Soft Silicon Case 3. USB-C To 3.5mm Adapter 4. USB Type-C Charging Cable 5. Wall Charger Adapter (5V/2A) 6. Quick Start Guide/Documentation The Mi A2 is the most premium feeling phone from Xiaomi under the INR 30K mark. It has a beautiful unibody metal design with curved edges. However, Xiaomi has decided to keep the design too thin for my liking. The Redmi Note 5 Pro and even the Mi A1 feel much more substantial in the hand. The Mi A2, though, is pretty manageable with one hand, thanks to the thin profile and those curved edges at the back. One more quirk that you’re going to notice this a lot during your time with this phone is that the thin profile means there’s a huge camera bump on the Mi A2’s rear. The camera bump is not just disturbing when you place the phone on a flat surface, but there’s also that constant fear of scratching the camera module glass. Thankfully, Xiaomi has included a soft case in the box for the A2 and that does improve the situation by a lot by masking this bump. Also, a welcome addition is the IR blaster at the top, which means you can control your TV, set-top boxes and other appliances via your phone using the Mi Remote app. At the front, There’s little to differentiate the Mi A2 from any other Xiaomi phone of 2018. There’s an extra-tall screen, but there are still some bezels present above and below the screen. I’m not really a fan of designs where the power button and the volume rocker are on the same side of the phone, but once you get used to the placement, it actually makes your one-handed usage experience better. The Mi A2 measures 158.7Ã75.4Ã7.3mm, which is 3.3mm taller, and actually 0.4mm narrower than the Mi A1. One of the standout features in this price range is the inclusion of a Type-C USB port. However, with a good decision, comes a surprisingly bad one too. The Mi A2, for some weird reason, doesn’t come with a 3.5mm headphone jack. And that takes away all the positives from the build and design perspective. Another bummer for some would be the fact that despite having a dual-Nano SIM card slot, it doesn’t come with a hybrid microSD card slot, so there is no scope for memory expansion on the Mi A2.  Keeping up with the 2018 trend, the 16:9 aspect ratio screen on the Mi A1 has been replaced by a 5.99-inch extra-tall display with 18:9 aspect ratio on the Mi A2. It is the exact same panel which is used in the Redmi Note 5 Pro. It’s an IPS LCD panel and for the price, it offers great viewing angles and good color reproduction. However, the screen’s brightness caps out at ~400 nits and that’s a bummer, especially if you’re trying to use the phone outdoors on a bright sunny day. Otherwise, the screen is good for media consumption. The screen can go really dim and that’s great for night-time usage. The lack of a notch means you don’t have to worry about your content being cropped out. However, the Mi A2, like many other Xiaomi devices, lacks Widevine L1 DRM certification, which means that you can’t watch Netflix and Amazon Prime videos in Full HD resolution on this device. Overall, a little more brightness and this could have been one of the best mobile screens in this price range.  The Mi A2 cameras have been a hot topic ever since it was launched. The phone has a dual-camera setup at the rear, consisting of a primary 12MP sensor (Sony IMX486) acting as its main sensor, and it has Æ/1.75 aperture and 1.25-micron pixels. The 20MP sensor (Sony IMX376) acts as a secondary camera, and it has Æ/1.75 aperture and 1.0Î¼m. However, Xiaomi uses the 4-in-1 pixel binning technique, which combines light and color information from four adjacent pixels to form one pixel, and the result is a brighter and better 5MP image. This image is stacked to the 12MP image from the primary sensor for a better end result. There’s phase-detection autofocus (PDAF), too, along with an LED flash to help in pitch dark conditions. The 20MP selfie camera (Sony IMX376) at the front has Æ/2.2 aperture and it features the same 4-in-1 âSuper Pixelâ pixel binning technology, promising 5MP images with good clarity. For the selfie lovers, there’s also a soft-toned 4500K LED flash at the front for conditions when there’s almost no ambient light. The Mi A2’s camera app is not what you’d get on a Pixel phone despite the Mi A2 being a device with stock Android UI. Similar to most other smartphones these days, there is a Portrait Mode for both front and rear-facing cameras. Other features includeÂ Face Recognition, AI Beautify 4.0, HDR Mode, and Burst Mode. The front-facing camera packs in some fancy stuff, too, and it includes AI-powered Beautify 4.0, HDR, AI-powered semantic segmentation, and face recognition. One thing that I didn’t like about the camera app is the settings layout. For some reason, the âSettingsâ option in the Camera app directs to settings for just one particular mode that is currently activated. So let’s say, if youâre in Photo mode, you canât see the video settings and vice-versa. The UI flow honestly takes some time to understand, and a couple of times, I lost myself navigating around the menus. The rear-facing camera also comes with a dedicated Manual Mode, which lets you fully control camera settings like shutter speed, white balance, exposure, and ISO. Xiaomi also lets you switch between the two lenses, which technically is supposed to help you in low-light photography. But in my usage, I found the Auto Mode to be much more suitable under all lighting conditions. The manual switching between primary and secondary lens is confusing and is buried deep down in the Manual Mode, and Xiaomi should have just added a simple toggle to switch between these cameras. The Mi A2 misses out on 4K 60fps video recording mode, but itâs unfair to ask for it from a mid-range smartphone when many high-end phones still don’t offer it. You can capture 4K UHD videos at 30fps, Full HD 1080p videos at 30fps/60fps, andÂ also HD 720p videos at 30fps. There’s also an option to shoot time-lapse videos and slow-motion videos (720p at 120fps). The Mi A2 doesnât feature optical image stabilization, so it has to make do with electronic image stabilization (EIS). Although, it’s only effective at Full HD resolution and it works properly only in well-lit conditions because the stabilization fails in low-light conditions; especially if there are moving lights in the scene. The Mi A2 performs exceptionally well in good lighting situations. The colors look nice, the dynamic range is wide for a phone in its price range and the camera manages to capture a lot of details. The Portrait Mode on this phone is fantastic, and the edge detection and bokeh effect are one of the best Iâve seen on a phone in this segment. Check out some shots I took from the Mi A2 rear cameras: I am a huge fan of the portrait mode on the Mi A2’s front-facing camera, and the AI Beautify mode works as expected. Skin tones and details in selfies come out just right. The dedicated selfie flash on the front camera ensures that even in the darkest of conditions, you can manage to click a well-lit selfie. Now, some samples from the front-facing camera: So overall, how does the Mi A2 camera perform? Well, it’s amazing. The front-facing camera coming really close to the cameras on much higher-end phones. The rear camera also manages to impress thoroughly, as long as there’s enough light. The only issue I faced in my usage was the low-light performance of the rear camera, specifically the secondary lens. When in Auto mode, the primary lens is used by default and it delivers good enough results on its own.

2415,32,/gear/xiaomi-redmi-6-pro-review-blurring-lines-redmi-redmi-note-series/,0,0,2018-09-24,xiaomi-redmi-6-pro-review-blurring-lines-redmi-redmi-note-series, Abid Iqbal ,Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro Review: Blurring The Lines Between Redmi And Redmi Note Series,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/xiaomi-redmi-6-pro-review-blurring-lines-redmi-redmi-note-series/," The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro, which was launched recently along with the Redmi 6A and the Redmi 6, comes as a slightly expensive alternative to the ultra-popular Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 (Review). The device brings two significant upgrades over the Redmi Note 5; a notched display for a higher screen-to-body ratio, and a dual-camera setup for better image quality. It retains the same hardware as the Redmi Note 5, though, including a metal body, Snapdragon 625 processor, and a massive 4000mAh battery. At a glance, it looks like a fair deal, spending a thousand bucks more for a compact design and a better camera, right? Well, there’s a catch. The Redmi 6 Pro misses out on 4K video recording and it has a slightly smaller display. So should you spend the extra money on the Redmi 6 Pro over the Redmi Note 5? Here is what I think after using the device for a couple of weeks now.  The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro features an all-new front design, courtesy of the notched, bezel-less display. The device is now more compact than its predecessor, and also looks in-line with the latest trend. The notch itself is tiny, unlike on the few other competitors such as the Nokia 6.1 Plus. The notch houses the earpiece, camera, and a couple of sensors. Switching to the back, it has the same, plain metal design that we are used to seeing with Xiaomi smartphones. The metal body feels robust and premium. The metal body of the device feels robust and premium. The device is slightly thicker than usual. This is mainly due to the limited vertical and horizontal space as a result of bezel cut-down. The thickness actually works in favour of the device; it offers more grip to the user while holding it. This is also the main reason why I managed to get through reviewing the device without even dropping it once. The fingerprint scanner is placed very conveniently on the back, making it easier to reach and unlock the device. Although, not everything is placed conveniently. Take the notification LED for example; it is placed on the bottom bezel, which is very odd. That being said, it does not hinder any functionality. For the price, there are smartphones that look way more attractive than the Redmi 6 Pro. Nonetheless, the Redmi 6 Pro is a beautiful smartphone and one that is very well built.  The Redmi 6 Pro is the first smartphone from Xiaomi in India to come with a notched display. The screen also has a taller, 19:9 aspect ratio. This sure makes the device more compact and gives it a better visual appeal. However, the fact that Android apps are yet to adopt the taller aspect ratio and the notch presents some issues while viewing videos and browsing through social media apps. Fortunately, though, there is an option to hide the notch for those who hate it. One of the best screens among its competitors, and you can’t get better than this in its price range. The 5.84-inch IPS LCD screen has a resolution of 2280×1080 pixels. The display is sharp and colourful, which makes consuming media on it an absolute joy. The outdoor visibility is good, thanks to the high brightness levels and a low reflective surface, at least for its price. The display, however, poses issue while displaying gradients of black and white, but that is the case with every budget smartphone out there, so Xiaomi isn’t to blame here. The Redmi 6 Pro has one of the best screens among its competitors, and I think you can’t get better than this in its price range.   Even budget smartphones nowadays come with a dual-camera setup, where one camera captures images, while the other acts as the depth-sensor. However, most of the budget smartphones with dual-camera setup use a low-resolution sensor for the depth-sensing camera; mostly a 2MP unit. Unlike them, the Redmi 6 Pro has a 12MP + 5MP dual-camera hardware, which looks promising on paper. Before we jump to the camera performance, let’s talk about the camera UI. In my opinion, the camera UI is neat, and simple to use. You can easily switch between modes by just swiping over the camera viewfinder, which includes your usual photo and video modes along with Square, Short Video, Portrait, and Panorama modes. The setting for each mode is neatly tucked into the modes themselves.  The image quality from this camera is excellent in the daylight. The images turn out colourful, bright, and full of details. There is a very minimal amount of noise, which is visible only if zoomed-in at 100%. The phase-detection autofocus does a brilliant job of focusing quickly and accurately. The dynamic range is also pretty good, and the camera manages to capture scenes with tricky lighting conditions very well.  The image quality, however, takes a hit during low-light conditions. There is a fair amount of noise in the images. Though the amount of details captured isn’t too bad, it could have been better. The colours reproduced are very vivid and thus saves the images from looking too shabby. Having tested enough smartphone cameras, I can firmly say that the lowlight image quality from the Redmi 6 Pro is better than what most of the other smartphones in the same price range offer. Coming to the Portrait mode, the camera produces some brilliant bokeh-effect images, that is if it works. It is kind of hit or miss. If it captures right, the images come out with great depth of field. Although, if it misses, you’ll be served with a scruffy background blur. Also, the Portrait mode is totally useless in low-light conditions. The camera just refuses to blur-out the background in such poorly lit conditions. The Redmi 6 Pro offers the best image quality among all its competitors with its rear camera. Jumping to the Panorama mode, which I guess not many people will use, I was surprised to see that the device is capable of capturing 13-megapixels Panorama images. This is quite unusual for smartphones in this price range, as most of them max out at around 5-megapixels. Take the Galaxy J6 for example. These panorama images have excellent stitching and details. The camera also compensates for the change in lighting conditions very well. Coming to the front-facing camera, it is a 5-megapixel unit with ƒ/2.0 aperture. This camera performs very well in the daylight. It takes detailed and vivid images. In low light, the images aren’t very bright, but not dull either. Xiaomi has also managed to pack the front-facing camera with the portrait mode, which takes help of the software to blur-out the background. This works very well most of the time. Although, just like the Portrait mode in the primary camera, this one too has a hit and miss performance. While the cheaper alternative of the Redmi 6 Pro, which is the Redmi Note 5, can record 4K videos, the former can’t in spite of having the same amount of processing power. I’m not sure if this is a cost-cutting measure, or a deliberate effort to keep the 4K video recording exclusive to the Redmi Note 5. Either way, I’m disappointed. That being said, the Full HD video recording that the Redmi 6 Pro offers, has a very good quality, including smooth video stabilisation, vivid colours, and a decent amount of details. Overall, I think the Redmi 6 Pro offers the best image quality among all its competitors with its rear camera. The selfie camera isn’t the best out there in the price range, but it does an excellent job, and I don’t see any reason to complain about it. I just wish that the Redmi 6 Pro had the 4K video recording, which would have made it a complete package.  The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro comes with the same, tried-and-tested, Snapdragon 625 processor that we’ve seen from the past two generations of Xiaomi smartphones. You have an option to choose between the 3GB+32GB variant and 4GB+64GB variant. The one we got for the review has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The device runs on Android 8.1 Oreo OS, which, as you can expect, is coated with MIUI 9.6 skin. Snapdragon 625 is showing its age and lacks the processing and graphics power to run a Full HD+ display smoothly. Initially, I found the Redmi 6 Pro to have a fast and smooth performance. However, as I started using it more and more, I realised that it isn’t smooth after all. The phone is notably slow at opening apps. It also stutters frequently, may it be while using apps, switching between them, or just surfing through the UI. The Snapdragon 625 is to blame here. It is showing its age and lacks the processing and graphics power to run a Full HD+ display smoothly. Although, this could also be because of poor customisation. Either way, this is not what we have come to expect from Xiaomi smartphones. It is time that Xiaomi opts for a better performing chipset to maintain a fast performance, and also the brand’s image. Coming to the software, the MIUI 9.6 offers immense UI customisation. It packs tons and tons of features including the essentials such as the dual-apps, app-locker, Second Space (for hiding files), and customisable themes. The design of the UI is modern, and it looks very polished. I would prefer the MIUI over the customisations from Honor, Vivo, and Oppo any day. That being said, the MIUI does have its flaws, and the most significant is the lack of application drawer. Although this can be fixed with any third party launcher. MIUI 9.6 offers immense UI customisations. As for the connectivity, the device has a dual-SIM card slot which supports 4G LTE with VoLTE. However, only one SIM card can work on the 4G network at a time. It would have been great to see both the SIM cards supporting 4G network, but no other manufacturer is offering that in this price range yet. The call quality and the network reception were flawless for the period I used the device. There is also dual-band Wi-Fi, which has fast transfer speeds. The only thing I miss in the connectivity department is the lack of USB Type-C port. Well, not many budget smartphones have it, but I think it is time for brands like Xiaomi to bring this change. Coming to the audio, the speaker of the Redmi 6 Pro is quite loud and has a decent quality. The 3.5mm audio jack also puts out a solid performance with high volume levels and decently balanced sound signature. This is one of the best battery back-ups you could get out of a smartphone. The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro packs a hefty 4000mAh battery. The combination of the large battery pack and a power-efficient processor yielded an average usage time of one and a half day with around 7 hours of screen-on time. In non-technical terms, this is one of the best battery back-ups you could get out of a smartphone. The only bummer, however, has to be the lack of fast charging; hence, the device takes almost three hours to fill a totally drained battery.  The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro isn’t the fastest smartphone its segment and lacks 4K video recording, which we’ve come to expect from smartphones in this price range. Although, those were the only two major drawbacks of the phone. Apart from that, it gets everything else right. All-in-all, the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is a great package, and absolutely worth buying. The Redmi 6 Pro has a solid build quality, and its display is a joy to look at. The cameras do a brilliant job at capturing images, considering the price of the device, and the device has one heck of a battery backup. On top of that, there is the beautiful and feature-packed MIUI skin. All-in-all, the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is a great package, and absolutely worth buying.

The device brings two significant upgrades over the Redmi Note 5; a notched display for a higher screen-to-body ratio, and a dual-camera setup for better image quality. It retains the same hardware as the Redmi Note 5, though, including a metal body, Snapdragon 625 processor, and a massive 4000mAh battery. At a glance, it looks like a fair deal, spending a thousand bucks more for a compact design and a better camera, right? Well, thereâs a catch. The Redmi 6 Pro misses out on 4K video recording and it has a slightly smaller display. So should you spend the extra money on the Redmi 6 Pro over the Redmi Note 5? Here is what I think after using the device for a couple of weeks now.Â  The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro features an all-new front design, courtesy of the notched, bezel-less display. The device is now more compact than its predecessor, and also looks in-line with the latest trend. The notch itself is tiny, unlike on the few other competitors such as the Nokia 6.1 Plus. The notch houses the earpiece, camera, and a couple of sensors. Switching to the back, it has the same, plain metal design that we are used to seeing with Xiaomi smartphones. The metal body feels robust and premium. The metal body of the device feels robust and premium. The device is slightly thicker than usual. This is mainly due to the limited vertical and horizontal space as a result of bezel cut-down. The thickness actually works in favour of the device; it offers more grip to the user while holding it. This is also the main reason why I managed to get through reviewing the device without even dropping it once. The fingerprint scanner is placed very conveniently on the back, making it easier to reach and unlock the device. Although, not everything is placed conveniently. Take the notification LED for example; it is placed on the bottom bezel, which is very odd. That being said, it does not hinder any functionality. For the price, there are smartphones that look way more attractive than the Redmi 6 Pro. Nonetheless, the Redmi 6 Pro is a beautiful smartphone and one that is very well built.  The Redmi 6 Pro is the first smartphone from Xiaomi in India to come with a notched display. The screen also has a taller, 19:9 aspect ratio. This sure makes the device more compact and gives it a better visual appeal. However, the fact that Android apps are yet to adopt the taller aspect ratio and the notch presents some issues while viewing videos and browsing through social media apps. Fortunately, though, there is an option to hide the notch for those who hate it. One of the best screens among its competitors, and you canât get better than this in its price range. The 5.84-inch IPS LCD screen has a resolution of 2280Ã1080 pixels. The display is sharp and colourful, which makes consuming media on it an absolute joy. The outdoor visibility is good, thanks to the high brightness levels and a low reflective surface, at least for its price. The display, however, poses issue while displaying gradients of black and white, but that is the case with every budget smartphone out there, so Xiaomi isnât to blame here. The Redmi 6 Pro has one of the best screens among its competitors, and I think you canât get better than this in its price range.Â   Even budget smartphones nowadays come with a dual-camera setup, where one camera captures images, while the other acts as the depth-sensor. However, most of the budget smartphones with dual-camera setup use a low-resolution sensor for the depth-sensing camera; mostly a 2MP unit. Unlike them, the Redmi 6 Pro has a 12MP + 5MP dual-camera hardware, which looks promising on paper. Before we jump to the camera performance, letâs talk about the camera UI. In my opinion, the camera UI is neat, and simple to use. You can easily switch between modes by just swiping over the camera viewfinder, which includes your usual photo and video modes along with Square, Short Video, Portrait, and Panorama modes. The setting for each mode is neatly tucked into the modes themselves.Â  The image quality from this camera is excellent in the daylight. The images turn out colourful, bright, and full of details. There is a very minimal amount of noise, which is visible only if zoomed-in at 100%. The phase-detection autofocus does a brilliant job of focusing quickly and accurately. The dynamic range is also pretty good, and the camera manages to capture scenes with tricky lighting conditions very well.Â  The image quality, however, takes a hit during low-light conditions. There is a fair amount of noise in the images. Though the amount of details captured isnât too bad, it could have been better. The colours reproduced are very vivid and thus saves the images from looking too shabby. Having tested enough smartphone cameras, I can firmly say that the lowlight image quality from the Redmi 6 Pro is better than what most of the other smartphones in the same price range offer. Coming to the Portrait mode, the camera produces some brilliant bokeh-effect images, that is if it works. It is kind of hit or miss. If it captures right, the images come out with great depth of field. Although, if it misses, youâll be served with a scruffy background blur. Also, the Portrait mode is totally useless in low-light conditions. The camera just refuses to blur-out the background in such poorly lit conditions. The Redmi 6 Pro offers the best image quality among all its competitors with its rear camera. Jumping to the Panorama mode, which I guess not many people will use, I was surprised to see that the device is capable of capturing 13-megapixels Panorama images. This is quite unusual for smartphones in this price range, as most of them max out at around 5-megapixels. Take the Galaxy J6 for example. These panorama images have excellent stitching and details. The camera also compensates for the change in lighting conditions very well. Coming to the front-facing camera, it is a 5-megapixel unit with Æ/2.0 aperture. This camera performs very well in the daylight. It takes detailed and vivid images. In low light, the images arenât very bright, but not dull either. Xiaomi has also managed to pack the front-facing camera with the portrait mode, which takes help of the software to blur-out the background. This works very well most of the time. Although, just like the Portrait mode in the primary camera, this one too has a hit and miss performance. While the cheaper alternative of the Redmi 6 Pro, which is the Redmi Note 5, can record 4K videos, the former canât in spite of having the same amount of processing power. Iâm not sure if this is a cost-cutting measure, or a deliberate effort to keep the 4K video recording exclusive to the Redmi Note 5. Either way, Iâm disappointed. That being said, the Full HD video recording that the Redmi 6 Pro offers, has a very good quality, including smooth video stabilisation, vivid colours, and a decent amount of details. Overall, I think the Redmi 6 Pro offers the best image quality among all its competitors with its rear camera. The selfie camera isnât the best out there in the price range, but it does an excellent job, and I donât see any reason to complain about it. I just wish that the Redmi 6 Pro had the 4K video recording, which would have made it a complete package.  The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro comes with the same, tried-and-tested, Snapdragon 625 processor that weâve seen from the past two generations of Xiaomi smartphones. You have an option to choose between the 3GB+32GB variant and 4GB+64GB variant. The one we got for the review has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The device runs on Android 8.1 Oreo OS, which, as you can expect, is coated with MIUI 9.6 skin. Snapdragon 625 is showing its age and lacks the processing and graphics power to run a Full HD+ display smoothly. Initially, I found the Redmi 6 Pro to have a fast and smooth performance. However, as I started using it more and more, I realised that it isnât smooth after all. The phone is notably slow at opening apps. It also stutters frequently, may it be while using apps, switching between them, or just surfing through the UI. The Snapdragon 625 is to blame here. It is showing its age and lacks the processing and graphics power to run a Full HD+ display smoothly. Although, this could also be because of poor customisation. Either way, this is not what we have come to expect from Xiaomi smartphones. It is time that Xiaomi opts for a better performing chipset to maintain a fast performance, and also the brandâs image. Coming to the software, the MIUI 9.6 offers immense UI customisation. It packs tons and tons of features including the essentials such as the dual-apps, app-locker, Second Space (for hiding files), and customisable themes. The design of the UI is modern, and it looks very polished. I would prefer the MIUI over the customisations from Honor, Vivo, and Oppo any day. That being said, the MIUI does have its flaws, and the most significant is the lack of application drawer. Although this can be fixed with any third party launcher. MIUI 9.6 offers immense UI customisations. As for the connectivity, the device has a dual-SIM card slot which supports 4G LTE with VoLTE. However, only one SIM card can work on the 4G network at a time. It would have been great to see both the SIM cards supporting 4G network, but no other manufacturer is offering that in this price range yet. The call quality and the network reception were flawless for the period I used the device. There is also dual-band Wi-Fi, which has fast transfer speeds. The only thing I miss in the connectivity department is the lack of USB Type-C port. Well, not many budget smartphones have it, but I think it is time for brands like Xiaomi to bring this change. Coming to the audio, the speaker of the Redmi 6 Pro is quite loud and has a decent quality. The 3.5mm audio jack also puts out a solid performance with high volume levels and decently balanced sound signature. This is one of the best battery back-ups you could get out of a smartphone. The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro packs a hefty 4000mAh battery. The combination of the large battery pack and a power-efficient processor yielded an average usage time of one and a half day with around 7 hours of screen-on time. In non-technical terms, this is one of the best battery back-ups you could get out of a smartphone. The only bummer, however, has to be the lack of fast charging; hence, the device takes almost three hours to fill a totally drained battery.  The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro isnât the fastest smartphone its segment and lacks 4K video recording, which weâve come to expect from smartphones in this price range. Although, those were the only two major drawbacks of the phone. Apart from that, it gets everything else right. All-in-all, the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is a great package, and absolutely worth buying. The Redmi 6 Pro has a solid build quality, and its display is a joy to look at. The cameras do a brilliant job at capturing images, considering the price of the device, and the device has one heck of a battery backup. On top of that, there is the beautiful and feature-packed MIUI skin. All-in-all, the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is a great package, and absolutely worth buying.

Either way, this is not what we have come to expect from Xiaomi smartphones. It is time that Xiaomi opts for a better performing chipset to maintain a fast performance, and also the brandâs image. Coming to the software, the MIUI 9.6 offers immense UI customisation. It packs tons and tons of features including the essentials such as the dual-apps, app-locker, Second Space (for hiding files), and customisable themes. The design of the UI is modern, and it looks very polished. I would prefer the MIUI over the customisations from Honor, Vivo, and Oppo any day. That being said, the MIUI does have its flaws, and the most significant is the lack of application drawer. Although this can be fixed with any third party launcher. MIUI 9.6 offers immense UI customisations. As for the connectivity, the device has a dual-SIM card slot which supports 4G LTE with VoLTE. However, only one SIM card can work on the 4G network at a time.

The only thing I miss in the connectivity department is the lack of USB Type-C port. Well, not many budget smartphones have it, but I think it is time for brands like Xiaomi to bring this change. Coming to the audio, the speaker of the Redmi 6 Pro is quite loud and has a decent quality. The 3.5mm audio jack also puts out a solid performance with high volume levels and decently balanced sound signature. This is one of the best battery back-ups you could get out of a smartphone. The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro packs a hefty 4000mAh battery. The combination of the large battery pack and a power-efficient processor yielded an average usage time of one and a half day with around 7 hours of screen-on time.

The device brings two significant upgrades over the Redmi Note 5; a notched display for a higher screen-to-body ratio, and a dual-camera setup for better image quality. It retains the same hardware as the Redmi Note 5, though, including a metal body, Snapdragon 625 processor, and a massive 4000mAh battery. At a glance, it looks like a fair deal, spending a thousand bucks more for a compact design and a better camera, right? Well, thereâs a catch. The Redmi 6 Pro misses out on 4K video recording and it has a slightly smaller display. So should you spend the extra money on the Redmi 6 Pro over the Redmi Note 5? Here is what I think after using the device for a couple of weeks now.Â  The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro features an all-new front design, courtesy of the notched, bezel-less display. The device is now more compact than its predecessor, and also looks in-line with the latest trend. The notch itself is tiny, unlike on the few other competitors such as the Nokia 6.1 Plus. The notch houses the earpiece, camera, and a couple of sensors. Switching to the back, it has the same, plain metal design that we are used to seeing with Xiaomi smartphones. The metal body feels robust and premium. The metal body of the device feels robust and premium. The device is slightly thicker than usual. This is mainly due to the limited vertical and horizontal space as a result of bezel cut-down. The thickness actually works in favour of the device; it offers more grip to the user while holding it. This is also the main reason why I managed to get through reviewing the device without even dropping it once. The fingerprint scanner is placed very conveniently on the back, making it easier to reach and unlock the device. Although, not everything is placed conveniently. Take the notification LED for example; it is placed on the bottom bezel, which is very odd. That being said, it does not hinder any functionality. For the price, there are smartphones that look way more attractive than the Redmi 6 Pro. Nonetheless, the Redmi 6 Pro is a beautiful smartphone and one that is very well built.  The Redmi 6 Pro is the first smartphone from Xiaomi in India to come with a notched display. The screen also has a taller, 19:9 aspect ratio. This sure makes the device more compact and gives it a better visual appeal. However, the fact that Android apps are yet to adopt the taller aspect ratio and the notch presents some issues while viewing videos and browsing through social media apps. Fortunately, though, there is an option to hide the notch for those who hate it. One of the best screens among its competitors, and you canât get better than this in its price range. The 5.84-inch IPS LCD screen has a resolution of 2280Ã1080 pixels. The display is sharp and colourful, which makes consuming media on it an absolute joy. The outdoor visibility is good, thanks to the high brightness levels and a low reflective surface, at least for its price. The display, however, poses issue while displaying gradients of black and white, but that is the case with every budget smartphone out there, so Xiaomi isnât to blame here. The Redmi 6 Pro has one of the best screens among its competitors, and I think you canât get better than this in its price range.Â   Even budget smartphones nowadays come with a dual-camera setup, where one camera captures images, while the other acts as the depth-sensor. However, most of the budget smartphones with dual-camera setup use a low-resolution sensor for the depth-sensing camera; mostly a 2MP unit. Unlike them, the Redmi 6 Pro has a 12MP + 5MP dual-camera hardware, which looks promising on paper. Before we jump to the camera performance, letâs talk about the camera UI. In my opinion, the camera UI is neat, and simple to use. You can easily switch between modes by just swiping over the camera viewfinder, which includes your usual photo and video modes along with Square, Short Video, Portrait, and Panorama modes. The setting for each mode is neatly tucked into the modes themselves.Â  The image quality from this camera is excellent in the daylight. The images turn out colourful, bright, and full of details. There is a very minimal amount of noise, which is visible only if zoomed-in at 100%. The phase-detection autofocus does a brilliant job of focusing quickly and accurately. The dynamic range is also pretty good, and the camera manages to capture scenes with tricky lighting conditions very well.Â  The image quality, however, takes a hit during low-light conditions. There is a fair amount of noise in the images. Though the amount of details captured isnât too bad, it could have been better. The colours reproduced are very vivid and thus saves the images from looking too shabby. Having tested enough smartphone cameras, I can firmly say that the lowlight image quality from the Redmi 6 Pro is better than what most of the other smartphones in the same price range offer. Coming to the Portrait mode, the camera produces some brilliant bokeh-effect images, that is if it works. It is kind of hit or miss. If it captures right, the images come out with great depth of field. Although, if it misses, youâll be served with a scruffy background blur. Also, the Portrait mode is totally useless in low-light conditions. The camera just refuses to blur-out the background in such poorly lit conditions. The Redmi 6 Pro offers the best image quality among all its competitors with its rear camera. Jumping to the Panorama mode, which I guess not many people will use, I was surprised to see that the device is capable of capturing 13-megapixels Panorama images. This is quite unusual for smartphones in this price range, as most of them max out at around 5-megapixels. Take the Galaxy J6 for example. These panorama images have excellent stitching and details. The camera also compensates for the change in lighting conditions very well. Coming to the front-facing camera, it is a 5-megapixel unit with Æ/2.0 aperture. This camera performs very well in the daylight. It takes detailed and vivid images. In low light, the images arenât very bright, but not dull either. Xiaomi has also managed to pack the front-facing camera with the portrait mode, which takes help of the software to blur-out the background. This works very well most of the time. Although, just like the Portrait mode in the primary camera, this one too has a hit and miss performance. While the cheaper alternative of the Redmi 6 Pro, which is the Redmi Note 5, can record 4K videos, the former canât in spite of having the same amount of processing power. Iâm not sure if this is a cost-cutting measure, or a deliberate effort to keep the 4K video recording exclusive to the Redmi Note 5. Either way, Iâm disappointed. That being said, the Full HD video recording that the Redmi 6 Pro offers, has a very good quality, including smooth video stabilisation, vivid colours, and a decent amount of details. Overall, I think the Redmi 6 Pro offers the best image quality among all its competitors with its rear camera. The selfie camera isnât the best out there in the price range, but it does an excellent job, and I donât see any reason to complain about it. I just wish that the Redmi 6 Pro had the 4K video recording, which would have made it a complete package.  The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro comes with the same, tried-and-tested, Snapdragon 625 processor that weâve seen from the past two generations of Xiaomi smartphones. You have an option to choose between the 3GB+32GB variant and 4GB+64GB variant. The one we got for the review has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The device runs on Android 8.1 Oreo OS, which, as you can expect, is coated with MIUI 9.6 skin. Snapdragon 625 is showing its age and lacks the processing and graphics power to run a Full HD+ display smoothly. Initially, I found the Redmi 6 Pro to have a fast and smooth performance. However, as I started using it more and more, I realised that it isnât smooth after all. The phone is notably slow at opening apps.

Also, the Portrait mode is totally useless in low-light conditions. The camera just refuses to blur-out the background in such poorly lit conditions. The Redmi 6 Pro offers the best image quality among all its competitors with its rear camera. Jumping to the Panorama mode, which I guess not many people will use, I was surprised to see that the device is capable of capturing 13-megapixels Panorama images. This is quite unusual for smartphones in this price range, as most of them max out at around 5-megapixels. Take the Galaxy J6 for example. These panorama images have excellent stitching and details. The camera also compensates for the change in lighting conditions very well. Coming to the front-facing camera, it is a 5-megapixel unit with Æ/2.0 aperture. This camera performs very well in the daylight. It takes detailed and vivid images. In low light, the images arenât very bright, but not dull either. Xiaomi has also managed to pack the front-facing camera with the portrait mode, which takes help of the software to blur-out the background. This works very well most of the time. Although, just like the Portrait mode in the primary camera, this one too has a hit and miss performance. While the cheaper alternative of the Redmi 6 Pro, which is the Redmi Note 5, can record 4K videos, the former canât in spite of having the same amount of processing power. Iâm not sure if this is a cost-cutting measure, or a deliberate effort to keep the 4K video recording exclusive to the Redmi Note 5. Either way, Iâm disappointed. That being said, the Full HD video recording that the Redmi 6 Pro offers, has a very good quality, including smooth video stabilisation, vivid colours, and a decent amount of details. Overall, I think the Redmi 6 Pro offers the best image quality among all its competitors with its rear camera. The selfie camera isnât the best out there in the price range, but it does an excellent job, and I donât see any reason to complain about it. I just wish that the Redmi 6 Pro had the 4K video recording, which would have made it a complete package.  The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro comes with the same, tried-and-tested, Snapdragon 625 processor that weâve seen from the past two generations of Xiaomi smartphones. You have an option to choose between the 3GB+32GB variant and 4GB+64GB variant. The one we got for the review has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The device runs on Android 8.1 Oreo OS, which, as you can expect, is coated with MIUI 9.6 skin. Snapdragon 625 is showing its age and lacks the processing and graphics power to run a Full HD+ display smoothly. Initially, I found the Redmi 6 Pro to have a fast and smooth performance. However, as I started using it more and more, I realised that it isnât smooth after all. The phone is notably slow at opening apps. It also stutters frequently, may it be while using apps, switching between them, or just surfing through the UI. The Snapdragon 625 is to blame here. It is showing its age and lacks the processing and graphics power to run a Full HD+ display smoothly. Although, this could also be because of poor customisation. Either way, this is not what we have come to expect from Xiaomi smartphones. It is time that Xiaomi opts for a better performing chipset to maintain a fast performance, and also the brandâs image. Coming to the software, the MIUI 9.6 offers immense UI customisation. It packs tons and tons of features including the essentials such as the dual-apps, app-locker, Second Space (for hiding files), and customisable themes. The design of the UI is modern, and it looks very polished. I would prefer the MIUI over the customisations from Honor, Vivo, and Oppo any day. That being said, the MIUI does have its flaws, and the most significant is the lack of application drawer. Although this can be fixed with any third party launcher. MIUI 9.6 offers immense UI customisations. As for the connectivity, the device has a dual-SIM card slot which supports 4G LTE with VoLTE. However, only one SIM card can work on the 4G network at a time. It would have been great to see both the SIM cards supporting 4G network, but no other manufacturer is offering that in this price range yet. The call quality and the network reception were flawless for the period I used the device. There is also dual-band Wi-Fi, which has fast transfer speeds. The only thing I miss in the connectivity department is the lack of USB Type-C port. Well, not many budget smartphones have it, but I think it is time for brands like Xiaomi to bring this change. Coming to the audio, the speaker of the Redmi 6 Pro is quite loud and has a decent quality. The 3.5mm audio jack also puts out a solid performance with high volume levels and decently balanced sound signature. This is one of the best battery back-ups you could get out of a smartphone. The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro packs a hefty 4000mAh battery. The combination of the large battery pack and a power-efficient processor yielded an average usage time of one and a half day with around 7 hours of screen-on time. In non-technical terms, this is one of the best battery back-ups you could get out of a smartphone. The only bummer, however, has to be the lack of fast charging; hence, the device takes almost three hours to fill a totally drained battery.  The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro isnât the fastest smartphone its segment and lacks 4K video recording, which weâve come to expect from smartphones in this price range. Although, those were the only two major drawbacks of the phone. Apart from that, it gets everything else right. All-in-all, the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is a great package, and absolutely worth buying. The Redmi 6 Pro has a solid build quality, and its display is a joy to look at. The cameras do a brilliant job at capturing images, considering the price of the device, and the device has one heck of a battery backup. On top of that, there is the beautiful and feature-packed MIUI skin. All-in-all, the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is a great package, and absolutely worth buying. Now, for those who are confused between Redmi Note 5 and the Redmi 6 Pro, it all comes down to personal preference. If you donât want to lose out on 4K video recording, then get the Redmi Note 5, or else, the Redmi 6 Pro is the way to go."
2413,32,/gear/xiaomi-redmi-6-review/,0,0,2019-01-31,xiaomi-redmi-6-review, Awad Ballaith ,Xiaomi Redmi 6 Review: A Step Down From The Redmi 5 ,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/xiaomi-redmi-6-review/," Xiaomi became a household name in India with the help of its Redmi smartphone lineup. We reviewed the Redmi 5 last year, and it was one of the best budget smartphones you could get your hands on at the time. Since then, quite a few brands have come forward with their own budget offerings, ending up pressuring Xiaomi to up its game, but has it? Xiaomi did release the Redmi 6 a few months ago. It costs just INR 7,999 for its base variant which comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage, with an upgrade to 64GB of storage setting you back by INR 8,999. On paper, it is hard to see if this smartphone keeps up with the competition. In this review, we shall see if Xiaomi has done enough to stay competitive at this side of the market. The Redmi range of smartphones hasn’t really seen a major change in its design language for some time now. In the case of the Redmi 6, Xiaomi did make some improvements over its predecessor, but then it took a few steps back in other aspects. The overall look of the phone most certainly feels outdated, especially with the sizeable bezels above and below the display. Other than the black color variant, all other models come with white front panels. The way the selfie camera, earpiece, and front sensors have been positioned, it almost looks like an expressionless robot staring back at you. Coming to the build of the phone, you get an overwhelmingly plastic body with questionable structural integrity. I say this because of the two tiny cracks that appeared on the side of the phone after a nominal drop from a couple of feet off the ground. The full plastic construction feels like a downgrade from the metal backplate design that was found on the Redmi 5. Another move backward is with the rear-firing loudspeakers. Even though the volume levels from these speakers are quite decent, the placement feels unnatural for a modern smartphone. On a more positive note, the Redmi 6 gets two physical card slots – one holds SIM 1 + microSD card while the other holds SIM 2. The 3.5mm headphone jack on the top of the phone also delivers decent audio quality. The volume rockers and power button on the right provide satisfactory tactile feedback when clicked. A micro USB port for charging has been provided at the bottom of the phone. Finally, a recessed fingerprint scanner is located in a comfortable position at the back.  The Redmi 6 comes with a serviceable 5.45-inch IPS LCD. This HD+ resolution screen is good enough as far as casual content consumption goes. The color reproduction isn’t the best out there, but it should suffice for standard YouTube video watching and social media browsing. Outdoor legibility is also fine, although direct sunlight might prove a bit of a challenge. Adaptive brightness was a bit all over the place though, and I had to manually adjust it multiple times throughout the day.  Xiaomi has departed from the Snapdragon 450 of the Redmi 5 and opted to go with a MediaTek Heli P22 for the Redmi 6. Comparing benchmarks for both these chipsets shows how their CPU performances are almost identical, with the latter falling behind in GPU capabilities. This GPU downgrade is most apparent when playing even moderately demanding titles. Asphalt 9, in particular, will either present horrendous frame-rates or will outright crash. PUBG and Real Racing 3 fare slightly better as they are just barely playable. With that said, the Helio P22 does somewhat redeem itself by being more efficient. This helps get the power consumption down, potentially improving battery life. As for software, the Redmi 6 ships with MIUI 9 based on Android 8.1 Oreo. During the duration of this review, however, I did get the update to MIUI 10 based on the same version of Android. The day-to-day experience of this software and chipset combination is again passable only because how affordable this phone is. The overall speed in running and moving between various applications is acceptable. With that said, some navigation aspects do present issues. For example, double tapping the recent apps button to switch to the previously used app fails half the time. PIP mode for apps such as Swiggy caused noticeable lag. Furthermore, the phone offers Face Unlock, a feature that is just there for the sake of it. As long as the lighting conditions are favorable, Face Unlock does work, but it isn’t fast enough to be used as the primary means of unlocking the handset. Then we have MIUI which comes with some useful functionalities such as the large brightness adjustment bar in the notification shade. Pressing the volume buttons also prompts a large slider to show up, that further expands to let you change media, ringtone and alarm audio levels. Recent apps are also presented in a tile format, allowing access to at least four of the last used apps at a time. However, some design choices – such as the ugly square borders for everything other than system apps – don’t really make sense. Making matters worse is the amount of bloatware and ads that have been filled throughout this software. It is understandable that Xiaomi would rely on advertisements to achieve revenue targets while still keeping the price of the phone low, but this comes at the cost of a distracting user experience. Pretty much every Xiaomi app that comes pre-installed on the device is filled with a crap-ton of advertisements. Many of these apps keep bombarding you with promotional notifications. What’s more, you don’t get to turn off notifications for some of these apps, let alone uninstall them. And let’s not forget all the third-party applications that take up precious space on the handset. Even though G-board is pre-loaded on the phone, the default keyboard you are greeted with is Facemoji. Another gripe I have with this software is how much Xiaomi tries to push its own browser on the user. It was quite a hassle trying to get links to open on Chrome by default. Also, when you have the on-screen navigation buttons turned on and you swipe up from the bottom of the home screen, the Xiaomi browser pops up. There is no way to disable this intrusive feature. If Xiaomi really wants us to use its browser over others, why on Earth did it bother to pre-load both Chrome and UC Browser on the phone as well?  Surprisingly, the camera actually performs quite well on the Redmi 6. On the rear, you get a 12MP primary shooter paired with a 5MP depth sensor. Images captured from this setup actually come out with a nice level of detail and fairly accurate colors. Edge detection in portrait shots wasn’t too bad either. Even the 5MP selfie camera performed quite nicely, with a fairly decent level of sharpness and contrast levels. Indoor and low-light shots did present with some noise, but that was still in an acceptable range.  The Redmi 6’s battery life is strictly average. While its 3000mAh battery is smaller than its predecessor’s 3300mAh cell, the 12nm Helio P22 is said to be more efficient with regards to power consumption. This holds fairly true as the overall battery life isn’t too bad. On heavy use comprised of watching YouTube, browsing social media, downloading large files over Wi-Fi, playing games, and running multiple apps in the background, the phone lasted close to 13 hours with 4 hours of screen on time. On regular workdays, I was able to comfortably use the phone for a full day with about 15 percent charge left at night. Charging the phone from 0 to 100 percent takes slightly over two hours.  In this time of smartphone ingenuity, the Redmi 6 feels like a step backward. Its plastic design is uninspiring, and the use of a weak chipset is a let-down. How Xiaomi can call this a successor to the Redmi 5 is beyond me. I wouldn’t say the Redmi 6 is a complete disaster considering how well the camera performs. MIUI also has a few redeeming qualities despite being riddled with intrusive advertisements and bloatware. All things considered, it is difficult to recommend the Redmi 6 to anyone especially when options such as the Realme C1 exist."

PUBG and Real Racing 3 fare slightly better as they are just barely playable. With that said, the Helio P22 does somewhat redeem itself by being more efficient. This helps get the power consumption down, potentially improving battery life. As for software, the Redmi 6 ships with MIUI 9 based on Android 8.1 Oreo. During the duration of this review, however, I did get the update to MIUI 10 based on the same version of Android. The day-to-day experience of this software and chipset combination is again passable only because how affordable this phone is. The overall speed in running and moving between various applications is acceptable. With that said, some navigation aspects do present issues. For example, double tapping the recent apps button to switch to the previously used app fails half the time. PIP mode for apps such as Swiggy caused noticeable lag. Furthermore, the phone offers Face Unlock, a feature that is just there for the sake of it. As long as the lighting conditions are favorable, Face Unlock does work, but it isn’t fast enough to be used as the primary means of unlocking the handset. Then we have MIUI which comes with some useful functionalities such as the large brightness adjustment bar in the notification shade. Pressing the volume buttons also prompts a large slider to show up, that further expands to let you change media, ringtone and alarm audio levels. Recent apps are also presented in a tile format, allowing access to at least four of the last used apps at a time. However, some design choices â such as the ugly square borders for everything other than system apps â donât really make sense. Making matters worse is the amount of bloatware and ads that have been filled throughout this software. It is understandable that Xiaomi would rely on advertisements to achieve revenue targets while still keeping the price of the phone low, but this comes at the cost of a distracting user experience. Pretty much every Xiaomi app that comes pre-installed on the device is filled with a crap-ton of advertisements. Many of these apps keep bombarding you with promotional notifications. Whatâs more, you donât get to turn off notifications for some of these apps, let alone uninstall them. And letâs not forget all the third-party applications that take up precious space on the handset. Even though G-board is pre-loaded on the phone, the default keyboard you are greeted with is Facemoji. Another gripe I have with this software is how much Xiaomi tries to push its own browser on the user. It was quite a hassle trying to get links to open on Chrome by default. Also, when you have the on-screen navigation buttons turned on and you swipe up from the bottom of the home screen, the Xiaomi browser pops up. There is no way to disable this intrusive feature. If Xiaomi really wants us to use its browser over others, why on Earth did it bother to pre-load both Chrome and UC Browser on the phone as well?  Surprisingly, the camera actually performs quite well on the Redmi 6. On the rear, you get a 12MP primary shooter paired with a 5MP depth sensor. Images captured from this setup actually come out with a nice level of detail and fairly accurate colors. Edge detection in portrait shots wasnât too bad either. Even the 5MP selfie camera performed quite nicely, with a fairly decent level of sharpness and contrast levels. Indoor and low-light shots did present with some noise, but that was still in an acceptable range.  The Redmi 6âs battery life is strictly average. While its 3000mAh battery is smaller than its predecessorâs 3300mAh cell, the 12nm Helio P22 is said to be more efficient with regards to power consumption. This holds fairly true as the overall battery life isnât too bad. On heavy use comprised of watching YouTube, browsing social media, downloading large files over Wi-Fi, playing games, and running multiple apps in the background, the phone lasted close to 13 hours with 4 hours of screen on time. On regular workdays, I was able to comfortably use the phone for a full day with about 15 percent charge left at night. Charging the phone from 0 to 100 percent takes slightly over two hours.  In this time of smartphone ingenuity, the Redmi 6 feels like a step backward. Its plastic design is uninspiring, and the use of a weak chipset is a let-down. How Xiaomi can call this a successor to the Redmi 5 is beyond me. I wouldnât say the Redmi 6 is a complete disaster considering how well the camera performs. MIUI also has a few redeeming qualities despite being riddled with intrusive advertisements and bloatware. All things considered, it is difficult to recommend the Redmi 6 to anyone especially when options such as the Realme C1 exist."

We reviewed the Redmi 5 last year, and it was one of the best budget smartphones you could get your hands on at the time. Since then, quite a few brands have come forward with their own budget offerings, ending up pressuring Xiaomi to up its game, but has it? Xiaomi did release the Redmi 6 a few months ago. It costs just INR 7,999 for its base variant which comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage, with an upgrade to 64GB of storage setting you back by INR 8,999. On paper, it is hard to see if this smartphone keeps up with the competition. In this review, we shall see if Xiaomi has done enough to stay competitive at this side of the market. The Redmi range of smartphones hasn’t really seen a major change in its design language for some time now. In the case of the Redmi 6, Xiaomi did make some improvements over its predecessor, but then it took a few steps back in other aspects. The overall look of the phone most certainly feels outdated, especially with the sizeable bezels above and below the display. Other than the black color variant, all other models come with white front panels. The way the selfie camera, earpiece, and front sensors have been positioned, it almost looks like an expressionless robot staring back at you. Coming to the build of the phone, you get an overwhelmingly plastic body with questionable structural integrity. I say this because of the two tiny cracks that appeared on the side of the phone after a nominal drop from a couple of feet off the ground. The full plastic construction feels like a downgrade from the metal backplate design that was found on the Redmi 5. Another move backward is with the rear-firing loudspeakers. Even though the volume levels from these speakers are quite decent, the placement feels unnatural for a modern smartphone. On a more positive note, the Redmi 6 gets two physical card slots – one holds SIM 1 + microSD card while the other holds SIM 2. The 3.5mm headphone jack on the top of the phone also delivers decent audio quality. The volume rockers and power button on the right provide satisfactory tactile feedback when clicked. A micro USB port for charging has been provided at the bottom of the phone. Finally, a recessed fingerprint scanner is located in a comfortable position at the back.  The Redmi 6 comes with a serviceable 5.45-inch IPS LCD. This HD+ resolution screen is good enough as far as casual content consumption goes. The color reproduction isn’t the best out there, but it should suffice for standard YouTube video watching and social media browsing. Outdoor legibility is also fine, although direct sunlight might prove a bit of a challenge. Adaptive brightness was a bit all over the place though, and I had to manually adjust it multiple times throughout the day.  Xiaomi has departed from the Snapdragon 450 of the Redmi 5 and opted to go with a MediaTek Heli P22 for the Redmi 6.

And let’s not forget all the third-party applications that take up precious space on the handset. Even though G-board is pre-loaded on the phone, the default keyboard you are greeted with is Facemoji. Another gripe I have with this software is how much Xiaomi tries to push its own browser on the user. It was quite a hassle trying to get links to open on Chrome by default. Also, when you have the on-screen navigation buttons turned on and you swipe up from the bottom of the home screen, the Xiaomi browser pops up. There is no way to disable this intrusive feature. If Xiaomi really wants us to use its browser over others, why on Earth did it bother to pre-load both Chrome and UC Browser on the phone as well?  Surprisingly, the camera actually performs quite well on the Redmi 6. On the rear, you get a 12MP primary shooter paired with a 5MP depth sensor. Images captured from this setup actually come out with a nice level of detail and fairly accurate colors. Edge detection in portrait shots wasn’t too bad either. Even the 5MP selfie camera performed quite nicely, with a fairly decent level of sharpness and contrast levels. Indoor and low-light shots did present with some noise, but that was still in an acceptable range.  The Redmi 6’s battery life is strictly average. While its 3000mAh battery is smaller than its predecessor’s 3300mAh cell, the 12nm Helio P22 is said to be more efficient with regards to power consumption. This holds fairly true as the overall battery life isn’t too bad. On heavy use comprised of watching YouTube, browsing social media, downloading large files over Wi-Fi, playing games, and running multiple apps in the background, the phone lasted close to 13 hours with 4 hours of screen on time. On regular workdays, I was able to comfortably use the phone for a full day with about 15 percent charge left at night. Charging the phone from 0 to 100 percent takes slightly over two hours.  In this time of smartphone ingenuity, the Redmi 6 feels like a step backward. Its plastic design is uninspiring, and the use of a weak chipset is a let-down. How Xiaomi can call this a successor to the Redmi 5 is beyond me. I wouldn’t say the Redmi 6 is a complete disaster considering how well the camera performs. MIUI also has a few redeeming qualities despite being riddled with intrusive advertisements and bloatware. All things considered, it is difficult to recommend the Redmi 6 to anyone especially when options such as the Realme C1 exist."
2413,32,/gear/xiaomi-redmi-6-review/,0,0,2019-01-31,xiaomi-redmi-6-review, Awad Ballaith ,Xiaomi Redmi 6 Review: A Step Down From The Redmi 5Â ,https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/xiaomi-redmi-6-review/," Xiaomi became a household name in India with the help of its Redmi smartphone lineup. We reviewed the Redmi 5 last year, and it was one of the best budget smartphones you could get your hands on at the time. Since then, quite a few brands have come forward with their own budget offerings, ending up pressuring Xiaomi to up its game, but has it? Xiaomi did release the Redmi 6 a few months ago. It costs just INR 7,999 for its base variant which comes with 3GB of RAM and 32GB storage, with an upgrade to 64GB of storage setting you back by INR 8,999. On paper, it is hard to see if this smartphone keeps up with the competition. In this review, we shall see if Xiaomi has done enough to stay competitive at this side of the market. The Redmi range of smartphones hasnât really seen a major change in its design language for some time now. In the case of the Redmi 6, Xiaomi did make some improvements over its predecessor, but then it took a few steps back in other aspects. The overall look of the phone most certainly feels outdated, especially with the sizeable bezels above and below the display. Other than the black color variant, all other models come with white front panels. The way the selfie camera, earpiece, and front sensors have been positioned, it almost looks like an expressionless robot staring back at you. Coming to the build of the phone, you get an overwhelmingly plastic body with questionable structural integrity. I say this because of the two tiny cracks that appeared on the side of the phone after a nominal drop from a couple of feet off the ground. The full plastic construction feels like a downgrade from the metal backplate design that was found on the Redmi 5. Another move backward is with the rear-firing loudspeakers. Even though the volume levels from these speakers are quite decent, the placement feels unnatural for a modern smartphone. On a more positive note, the Redmi 6 gets two physical card slots â one holds SIM 1 + microSD card while the other holds SIM 2. The 3.5mm headphone jack on the top of the phone also delivers decent audio quality. The volume rockers and power button on the right provide satisfactory tactile feedback when clicked. A micro USB port for charging has been provided at the bottom of the phone. Finally, a recessed fingerprint scanner is located in a comfortable position at the back.  The Redmi 6 comes with a serviceable 5.45-inch IPS LCD. This HD+ resolution screen is good enough as far as casual content consumption goes. The color reproduction isnât the best out there, but it should suffice for standard YouTube video watching and social media browsing. Outdoor legibility is also fine, although direct sunlight might prove a bit of a challenge. Adaptive brightness was a bit all over the place though, and I had to manually adjust it multiple times throughout the day.  Xiaomi has departed from the Snapdragon 450 of the Redmi 5 and opted to go with a MediaTek Heli P22 for the Redmi 6. Comparing benchmarks for both these chipsets shows how their CPU performances are almost identical, with the latter falling behind in GPU capabilities. This GPU downgrade is most apparent when playing even moderately demanding titles. Asphalt 9, in particular, will either present horrendous frame-rates or will outright crash. PUBG and Real Racing 3 fare slightly better as they are just barely playable. With that said, the Helio P22 does somewhat redeem itself by being more efficient. This helps get the power consumption down, potentially improving battery life. As for software, the Redmi 6 ships with MIUI 9 based on Android 8.1 Oreo. During the duration of this review, however, I did get the update to MIUI 10 based on the same version of Android. The day-to-day experience of this software and chipset combination is again passable only because how affordable this phone is. The overall speed in running and moving between various applications is acceptable. With that said, some navigation aspects do present issues. For example, double tapping the recent apps button to switch to the previously used app fails half the time. PIP mode for apps such as Swiggy caused noticeable lag. Furthermore, the phone offers Face Unlock, a feature that is just there for the sake of it. As long as the lighting conditions are favorable, Face Unlock does work, but it isn’t fast enough to be used as the primary means of unlocking the handset. Then we have MIUI which comes with some useful functionalities such as the large brightness adjustment bar in the notification shade. Pressing the volume buttons also prompts a large slider to show up, that further expands to let you change media, ringtone and alarm audio levels. Recent apps are also presented in a tile format, allowing access to at least four of the last used apps at a time. However, some design choices â such as the ugly square borders for everything other than system apps â donât really make sense. Making matters worse is the amount of bloatware and ads that have been filled throughout this software. It is understandable that Xiaomi would rely on advertisements to achieve revenue targets while still keeping the price of the phone low, but this comes at the cost of a distracting user experience.

The phone completely overshadows its competition with its superior design and incredible performance. With this phone, Xiaomi regains its reputation as a market disrupter. The only problem here is the phone's availability as flash sales seem to end in seconds, and even most Mi Home stores seem to run out of stock. The phone is definitely worth the buy if you manage to get your hands on one.   The Redmi Note 7 has received a new MIUI software update with the version number v10.3.5.0.PFGMIXM. It weighs in at 588MB and comes with a plethora of bug fixes and new features along with March 2019s Android security patch. One of the highlight features added includes new AI Camera modes. Now, a floating window shows up when users get incoming calls while gaming. ...View more India's hyperlocal delivery service Dunzo has started selling the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 in the country through its app. Buyers in Bengaluru can get instant delivery of the phone and Dunzo will pick up the phone from a Mi Home store nearby. Dunzo claims that it will deliver the phone to its buyers within an hour from placing the order....View more A week after its launch in India, a new software update has arrived to bring night mode to the Redmi Note 7.

The front camera on the phone is also geared with AI assistance. The Redmi Note 7 sports a 13MP selfie camera with Portrait mode, Smart Beauty, Scene recognition, and more. Altogether, the camera specs on the Redmi Note 7 are pretty impressive for its cost. With the power of AI, the camera setup performs powerfully.  At its price in India, the Redmi Note 7 turns out to be a worthy competitor in the segment. However, it falls right on the spot with theÂ Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2Â (Review). Both the phones have got plenty of similarities when it comes to their processors and front camera setup. The Redmi Note 7 falls a little ahead as it boasts USB Type-C connectivity while the ZenFone Max Pro M2 settles for a microUSB port. Then again, the ZenFone Max Pro M2 takes the lead in the battery segment by offering a massive 5,000mAh battery compared to a 4,000mAh battery on the Redmi Note 7. Both the smartphones have a neck to neck battle and only time will tell who gets a better audience response. We think the buyers could fall for the Redmi Note 7 as it has Type-C connectivity, which makes it more relevant with the current tech trends. "
