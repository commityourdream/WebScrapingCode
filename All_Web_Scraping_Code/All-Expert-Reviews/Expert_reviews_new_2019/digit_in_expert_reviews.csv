1721,42,apple-iphone-7-plus-review-48556,0,0,2019-05-22,48556,Souvik Das,Apple iPhone 7 Plus Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/apple-iphone-7-plus-review-48556.html,"The Apple iPhone 7 Plus may well be the best smartphone out there right now, with class-leading performance, a very good camera and a sharp, vibrant display. It is also a prelude to what future iPhones may comprise. However, it is not an outright, radical upgrade, and the hefty price tag means you may ideally wait for 2017's iPhone, before making your purchase., , Every new iPhone built by Apple brings with itself an air of excitement. The iPhone 7 Plus here, Apple’s flagbearer, is the biggest, best smartphone Apple has built till date. The iPhone 7 Plus looks the way you would expect a flagship smartphone to look like, and has a typical air of refinement that we have come to expect of iPhones. With all of this in sight, what the iPhone 7 Plus is aiming for is the title of the best smartphone in the world right now. Do we get there? Well, quite so. Here’s why., Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Review, Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, The dual-camera setup
The iPhone 7 Plus brings with itself two, 12-megapixel main cameras that work in tandem and separately to present 2x optical zoom, along with improving image details and noise. The 12-megapixel primary image sensor that accompanies the 28mm, f/1.8 wide angle lens is a 1/3-inch type CMOS sensor, and the 12-megapixel image sensor accompanying the 56mm, f/2.8 telephoto lens is a 1/3.6-inch type sensor., 
Daylight, wide angle, Typically, these are smaller sensors than the ones used by the likes of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (1/2.5-inch type), Google Pixel XL (1/2.3-inch type) and LG G5 (1/2.6-inch type), which on paper may mean that low light performance would suffer. However, Apple has always aced noise cancellation, keeping an optimum balance of light, colours, noise and sharpness in the photographs that it shoots., 
Overcast, closeup, wide angle, In real life, the iPhone 7 Plus shoots delightful photographs with very good colour accuracy and white balance. Colours remain close to that of the source, and the saturation level is marginally tuned to the warm side to make photos look more pleasant. Details are crisp, and subjects retain a crisp level of sharpness that puts this camera notably ahead of the present crop of smartphones we have tested till date., 
100% crop, The iPhone 7 Plus also handles warm colour temperature ambience like dusk, night and more with a deft touch. It adjusts well to the ambience, and even in low light conditions, photographs are relatively free of noise. The iPhone does a great job of suppressing image noise, and keeps the frame brightly lit. colours stay accurate, and the saturation levels are well optimised to give photographs a warm, true-to-source look., 
Daylight, telephoto, Moving on to the dual-camera setup, the second camera shoots at 2x optical zoom from the wide angle camera. The f/2.8 lens can question the iPhone’s low light performance, and admittedly, photographs shot at telephoto are darker than what photographs from competing smartphones can shoot. This, coupled with the smaller sensor, does compromise a bit on low light performance, but here again, the iPhone 7 Plus does a great job of optimising itself in terms of details, colour and image noise. The noise reduction algorithm does well to adjust the smartphone’s camera to the ambience, and takes light data from the other sensor to keep image noise low., 
Diffused sunlight, telephoto, The bokeh mode has not hit the iPhones yet, but at f/1.8, the iPhone 7 Plus produces smooth, gently blurred backgrounds, with a round aperture that is finely reproduced by the camera. Photographs actually look impressive, as the bokeh appears close to what larger image lenses would produce in bigger, dedicated cameras. However, with the bokeh mode in sight, we expect a better bokeh performance, and hope that the algorithms keep the originality of blurred backgrounds intact., 
Diffused sunlight, wide angle, The iPhone 7 Plus is adept at recording smooth 4K videos at 30fps, although the level of noise is higher than what it produces in photographs. Slow motion videos are also produced really well, and the maximum you can go up to is 120fps at 1080p. The front camera, as in most iPhones, does a fair job of crisp selfies. It also retains Auto HDR and Retina Flash, making it one of the most impressive front camera units in the market., 
Indoor, indirect light, wide angle, All of this makes the Apple iPhone 7 Plus one of the most impressive smartphone cameras out there. It actually contends for the title of the best smartphone camera you can buy right now, and once the bokeh mode hits the phones, it may even clinch it., 
Indoor, low light, wide angle, But, the advent of Google’s Pixel phones may seem ominous for Apple’s dual camera flagship., Performance
The Apple A10 Fusion SoC is a quad-core unit, paired with 3GB of RAM - the highest ever on an iPhone. This is a clear intent from Apple to put more focus on flawless performance and higher multitasking capabilities, as even till mid-2015, its flagship had only 1GB of RAM., , What you get here is smooth, flawless performance undeterred by even the heaviest of tasks. The iPhone 7 Plus is a blazing fast smartphone that breezes through every possible daily task at hand, and aces multitasking. Switching between apps is seamless, even when you are switching between apps like Google Snapseed, Email, Facebook, Asphalt 8 and Google Maps. The iPhone 7 Plus retains its composure in terms of performance, along with giving you faster boot times, noticeably faster app load times, and an overall refined iOS experience. Despite all of this, the highest gaming temperature that I recorded was 39.3 degrees Celsius, and a 10-minute 4K video recording gave me a temperature of 41 degree Celsius. Both come by under stress tests, which are not ideal everyday situations, and hence, the overall heat management is fairly efficient., , As benchmarks would suggest, the iPhone 7 Plus is as good and fast as smartphones get. 3D Touch adds to the intuitive performance, and actually makes the most of iOS 10’s features. Apple wants you to use 3D Touch on its lockscreen widgets, and the higher amount of RAM and bigger display make it a wholesome, synchronised experience. For instance, you can easily hard press on a notification to respond to it directly from the lockscreen, without the need to open the app or unlocking the screen. However, for iMessages and text messages, no security authentication is required, and although you cannot access device contacts through this, anyone with access to your phone can reply to a message without your knowledge. This seems to be an inadvertent flaw on iOS 10, something that Apple may want to look into. Other apps like WhatsApp and Messenger require Touch ID or passcode to reply., , Calling and network performance is supreme on the iPhone 7 Plus, and it retains signal well even in areas with low connectivity. The in-ear audio quality is excellent, and you can even get to hear caller voices loud and clear in crowded places., , To sum up, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus is the ace. It can run any app smoothly, the extra gigabyte of RAM gives it an edge in terms of heavy performance, and multitasking is possibly the best in class. Calling, network and location services are precise, too, making this one of the best smartphones in the market right now., Audio port, stereo speakers
As you would also know by now, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus do not have the good old 3.5mm audio port any longer. Instead, Apple packs a Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter, and hopes that audio companies will soon have lightning port versions of the iconic headphones. We do not know if that will materialise soon or not, but in all fairness, I did not really miss the audio port. Even with the LeEco Le 2, I only missed it a couple of times, when my Bluetooth headphones were out of charge and the phone itself was charging, but such occasions are certainly not regular. Apple claims to have used the extra space from removing the headphone jack, for the two cameras and the taptic engine of the Home button, and I do not mind it being absent., While the lack of the 3.5mm jack is not a deal breaker, the presence of stereo speakers is a pleasant audio enhancement that you notice only after you start viewing movies and videos extensively here. Even in graphic and audio-intensive games like Shadow Bug, the stereo speaker setup of the iPhone 7 Plus sounds bright and well-detailed for a pair of phone speakers. The iPhone 7 Plus uses the earpiece output as the left channel and the bottom right speaker grille as the right channel, and the audio is immersive in the same way that the Sony Xperia Z5's speakers were. To sum it all up, the iPhone 7 Plus' native speakers are among the best smartphone speakers out there, topped only by the HTC 10 and the Sony Xperia Z5., iOS 10
Apple’s latest operating system was built keeping the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in mind, and it really shows. The larger notification tabs are easier on the eye here, 3D Touch is well integrated into the ecosystem and now gets more features within compatible apps, Siri is smarter, and Apple’s integration of its software with the custom-built hardware makes the overall ecosystem an excitingly smooth one to use., , The Home button is not a physical button any longer, as you would already know. The static touch panel, powered by a taptic engine, simulates the experience of a tap. It takes a while to get used to, and what you get is nowhere near a physical click. You can adjust the feedback to what suits you best - I choose the intensity of tap to ‘1’. It is also important to note that with ‘Raise to Wake’ active, the iPhone 7 Plus is even easier to use and unlock. Touch ID works more accurately, although this is just the first days of the iPhone, and we would like to see how well it works in the long run., For more details on how iOS 10 works and its key features, click here., Display
The 5.5-inch, 1080x1920-pixel Retina display has a smoother touch feedback than before, and the fluidity of the touch response really sets it apart from a lot of other flagship smartphones. The colour balance is pleasant, and the slight warmth makes the screen pleasant to look at. The iPhone 7 Plus now produces higher contrast, brighter whites and deeper blacks than its previous editions, all of which combine to make it look incredibly crisp., , The display measures 701 lux in brightness, which is good but lower than a Google Pixel XL or OnePlus 3. However, sunlight visibility is great, and legibility remains intact, thanks to Apple's auto-brightness algorithms. The right balance of contrast and sharpness, along with warm colour balance, makes the Retina display really pleasant to look at. The fluid touch response adds to it, and 3D Touch adds to its intuitiveness. On an overall note, the iPhone 7 Plus has one of the most well-balanced smartphone displays out there. High resolution videos look crisp and sharp, and the colour tone makes video streaming an enjoyable affair., However, it may be important to note that Apple’s Sapphire Glass screen protection can be questioned. Our unit of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus picked up an abysmally large number of scratches, somehow. This may not be a regular occurrence, but you should ideally be more careful about the display., You should, anyway, seeing that it is...considerably expensive., Build and Design
I could simply redirect you to the iPhone 6s review, as the iPhone 7 Plus does not get a radical makeover. The notable points of difference are the dual-camera bump (which is a bit too large), the missing headphone jack and the rearranged antenna bands. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus is distinctly well-built, and the premium metal leaves you with a lasting impression., , However, it is not the most compact smartphone out there, even considering 5.5-inch devices in the market. The new iPhone still retains large bezels, along with comparatively lesser screen-to-body ratio. While it is indeed sleek to hold, it loses out on grip, making it a rather slippery device to hold. The iPhone 7 Plus also feels a bit too large, particularly when you hold it up when on calls. Smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 have presented much smaller bodies with the same screen size, and maybe it is about time Apple looks into the ergonomics., , Having been used to much smaller smartphones, the iPhone 7 Plus feels a bit too large for my preference. It feels sturdy, and premium in hand, but does not present an extraordinary design in any manner. It is this, that makes the iPhone 7 Plus feel like an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6s., Battery life
On an average, a full charge of the 2900mAh battery pack lasts for about 20 hours, with over two hours of gaming, two hours of music streaming, an hour of video streaming, over 30 calls, extensive messaging and over 20 minutes of navigation. The iPhone 7 Plus lasts significantly longer, and certainly more than 24 hours, with lighter usage., As with every iPhone, the iPhone 7 Plus charges really fast, and the battery charges fully in just about 40 minutes. The iPhone 7 Plus is a decent improvement over the questioned battery performance of iPhones, although the iPhone 6s Plus delivers similar results in battery life. You will mostly end up keeping Bluetooth switched on because of the lack of a headphone jack, which eats more into battery life of the iPhone 7 Plus., Bottomline
The Apple iPhone 7 Plus is the ace. It has an excellent camera, offers the best performance that a smartphone can right now, and even delivers decent battery life. It still looks mostly like an old iPhone, the new Home button can take a while to get used to, and the smartphone is not the most ergonomic., Despite all of this, if you have the money and big screen smartphones is your thing, the iPhone 7 Plus is a compelling purchase. It offers a great, premium experience, and very few smartphones will come close to the overall experience of using the iPhone 7 Plus. You should upgrade to it only if the improved camera is something you really wish to have, as the iPhone 6s still offers decent performance in terms of what is required."

The iPhone 7 Plus is a blazing fast smartphone that breezes through every possible daily task at hand, and aces multitasking. Switching between apps is seamless, even when you are switching between apps like Google Snapseed, Email, Facebook, Asphalt 8 and Google Maps. The iPhone 7 Plus retains its composure in terms of performance, along with giving you faster boot times, noticeably faster app load times, and an overall refined iOS experience. Despite all of this, the highest gaming temperature that I recorded was 39.3 degrees Celsius, and a 10-minute 4K video recording gave me a temperature of 41 degree Celsius. Both come by under stress tests, which are not ideal everyday situations, and hence, the overall heat management is fairly efficient., , As benchmarks would suggest, the iPhone 7 Plus is as good and fast as smartphones get. 3D Touch adds to the intuitive performance, and actually makes the most of iOS 10’s features. Apple wants you to use 3D Touch on its lockscreen widgets, and the higher amount of RAM and bigger display make it a wholesome, synchronised experience. For instance, you can easily hard press on a notification to respond to it directly from the lockscreen, without the need to open the app or unlocking the screen. However, for iMessages and text messages, no security authentication is required, and although you cannot access device contacts through this, anyone with access to your phone can reply to a message without your knowledge. This seems to be an inadvertent flaw on iOS 10, something that Apple may want to look into. Other apps like WhatsApp and Messenger require Touch ID or passcode to reply., , Calling and network performance is supreme on the iPhone 7 Plus, and it retains signal well even in areas with low connectivity. The in-ear audio quality is excellent, and you can even get to hear caller voices loud and clear in crowded places., , To sum up, the Apple iPhone 7 Plus is the ace. It can run any app smoothly, the extra gigabyte of RAM gives it an edge in terms of heavy performance, and multitasking is possibly the best in class. Calling, network and location services are precise, too, making this one of the best smartphones in the market right now., Audio port, stereo speakers
As you would also know by now, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus do not have the good old 3.5mm audio port any longer. Instead, Apple packs a Lightning-to-3.5mm adapter, and hopes that audio companies will soon have lightning port versions of the iconic headphones. We do not know if that will materialise soon or not, but in all fairness, I did not really miss the audio port. Even with the LeEco Le 2, I only missed it a couple of times, when my Bluetooth headphones were out of charge and the phone itself was charging, but such occasions are certainly not regular. Apple claims to have used the extra space from removing the headphone jack, for the two cameras and the taptic engine of the Home button, and I do not mind it being absent., While the lack of the 3.5mm jack is not a deal breaker, the presence of stereo speakers is a pleasant audio enhancement that you notice only after you start viewing movies and videos extensively here. Even in graphic and audio-intensive games like Shadow Bug, the stereo speaker setup of the iPhone 7 Plus sounds bright and well-detailed for a pair of phone speakers. The iPhone 7 Plus uses the earpiece output as the left channel and the bottom right speaker grille as the right channel, and the audio is immersive in the same way that the Sony Xperia Z5's speakers were. To sum it all up, the iPhone 7 Plus' native speakers are among the best smartphone speakers out there, topped only by the HTC 10 and the Sony Xperia Z5., iOS 10
Apple’s latest operating system was built keeping the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in mind, and it really shows. The larger notification tabs are easier on the eye here, 3D Touch is well integrated into the ecosystem and now gets more features within compatible apps, Siri is smarter, and Apple’s integration of its software with the custom-built hardware makes the overall ecosystem an excitingly smooth one to use., , The Home button is not a physical button any longer, as you would already know. The static touch panel, powered by a taptic engine, simulates the experience of a tap. It takes a while to get used to, and what you get is nowhere near a physical click. You can adjust the feedback to what suits you best - I choose the intensity of tap to ‘1’. It is also important to note that with ‘Raise to Wake’ active, the iPhone 7 Plus is even easier to use and unlock. Touch ID works more accurately, although this is just the first days of the iPhone, and we would like to see how well it works in the long run., For more details on how iOS 10 works and its key features, click here., Display
The 5.5-inch, 1080x1920-pixel Retina display has a smoother touch feedback than before, and the fluidity of the touch response really sets it apart from a lot of other flagship smartphones. The colour balance is pleasant, and the slight warmth makes the screen pleasant to look at. The iPhone 7 Plus now produces higher contrast, brighter whites and deeper blacks than its previous editions, all of which combine to make it look incredibly crisp., , The display measures 701 lux in brightness, which is good but lower than a Google Pixel XL or OnePlus 3. However, sunlight visibility is great, and legibility remains intact, thanks to Apple's auto-brightness algorithms. The right balance of contrast and sharpness, along with warm colour balance, makes the Retina display really pleasant to look at. The fluid touch response adds to it, and 3D Touch adds to its intuitiveness. On an overall note, the iPhone 7 Plus has one of the most well-balanced smartphone displays out there. High resolution videos look crisp and sharp, and the colour tone makes video streaming an enjoyable affair., However, it may be important to note that Apple’s Sapphire Glass screen protection can be questioned. Our unit of the Apple iPhone 7 Plus picked up an abysmally large number of scratches, somehow. This may not be a regular occurrence, but you should ideally be more careful about the display., You should, anyway, seeing that it is...considerably expensive., Build and Design
I could simply redirect you to the iPhone 6s review, as the iPhone 7 Plus does not get a radical makeover. The notable points of difference are the dual-camera bump (which is a bit too large), the missing headphone jack and the rearranged antenna bands. The Apple iPhone 7 Plus is distinctly well-built, and the premium metal leaves you with a lasting impression., , However, it is not the most compact smartphone out there, even considering 5.5-inch devices in the market. The new iPhone still retains large bezels, along with comparatively lesser screen-to-body ratio. While it is indeed sleek to hold, it loses out on grip, making it a rather slippery device to hold. The iPhone 7 Plus also feels a bit too large, particularly when you hold it up when on calls. Smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 have presented much smaller bodies with the same screen size, and maybe it is about time Apple looks into the ergonomics., , Having been used to much smaller smartphones, the iPhone 7 Plus feels a bit too large for my preference. It feels sturdy, and premium in hand, but does not present an extraordinary design in any manner. It is this, that makes the iPhone 7 Plus feel like an incremental upgrade over the iPhone 6s., Battery life
On an average, a full charge of the 2900mAh battery pack lasts for about 20 hours, with over two hours of gaming, two hours of music streaming, an hour of video streaming, over 30 calls, extensive messaging and over 20 minutes of navigation. The iPhone 7 Plus lasts significantly longer, and certainly more than 24 hours, with lighter usage., As with every iPhone, the iPhone 7 Plus charges really fast, and the battery charges fully in just about 40 minutes. The iPhone 7 Plus is a decent improvement over the questioned battery performance of iPhones, although the iPhone 6s Plus delivers similar results in battery life. You will mostly end up keeping Bluetooth switched on because of the lack of a headphone jack, which eats more into battery life of the iPhone 7 Plus., Bottomline
The Apple iPhone 7 Plus is the ace. It has an excellent camera, offers the best performance that a smartphone can right now, and even delivers decent battery life. It still looks mostly like an old iPhone, the new Home button can take a while to get used to, and the smartphone is not the most ergonomic., Despite all of this, if you have the money and big screen smartphones is your thing, the iPhone 7 Plus is a compelling purchase. It offers a great, premium experience, and very few smartphones will come close to the overall experience of using the iPhone 7 Plus. You should upgrade to it only if the improved camera is something you really wish to have, as the iPhone 6s still offers decent performance in terms of what is required."

Like all iPhone, the Rs. 39,000 price tag can seem overpriced, and is a big reason why the phone is tough to recommend today. If you stricly want a smaller device, then this is the best option for you. If not, there are a sea of Android and iOS phones available to choose from., , It had been a while since rumours of a 4-inch iPhone started circulating. At the launch of the iPhone 6s, many had expected Apple to simultaneously present a smaller, 4-inch iPhone as a less expensive, smaller screen alternative to the iPhone 6 and 6S, and their respective ‘Plus’ variants. Six months after the iPhone 6s, the iPhone SE became official. And a surprisingly large number of people rejoiced, including me., Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, I have loyally stood by my iPhone 5s, now over two-and-half years old, and it serves me nobly. On an overall, everyday basis, the iPhone 5s is still a fantastic driver. Apps barely lag, I can even afford to keep my push mail notifications to every 15 minutes and not reset network settings, and it still works fine enough. Lags, however, have started showing up. The A7 processor is still reasonably fast, but is just not fast enough. For instance, apps take that split second longer to load, there’s always the one second of blank screen when I switch between different apps, and games reflect this even more., Unfortunately, even after having used a number of large display devices, I’m only too used to the 4-inch form factor. The iPhone SE, on that note, was all that old iPhone users could have asked for. Powered by the latest generation hardware, the iPhone SE is the iPhone 6s on the inside, with the exact design and footprint of the iPhone 5s. Why would I not love it?, I’m not saying I don’t, but there were too many questions that prevents from calling it instantly recommendable. Here’s why., The 4-inch Retina display
Let’s begin with the most debatable point here - the 4-inch display. From a standalone point of view, the 4-inch Retina display is as good as ever, packing in ample pixels to deliver rich, sharp and immaculate details on the screen. It is responsive and fast, and looks significantly warmer than the display of the iPhone 5s. This makes it less harsh to look at, and Night Shift mode makes it even better. Quality-wise, you’ll be hard-pushed to find a better one - brilliant viewing angles, ample brightness, good visibility under direct sunlight, and nearly flawless touch response, too. But, this also raised the biggest question about the iPhone SE., Whenever I have switched smartphones, they’ve always been a significant upgrade in every aspect of the device. The 4-inch display is undoubtedly good, but it is not a whole lot better. Additionally, the screen size now does feel hindered. You need to scroll more when you’re reading, squint a bit to tap on the right tabs while within a game, and even when watching videos, it feels a tad bit too small, especially after residing in a world of smartphones where 5-inch displays have become a norm., ""The 4-inch panel remains excellent, but the size is simply not enough in today's nature of content consumption"", Does it make sense? Yes, and no. Apple has repeatedly stated that the iPhone SE is for those who really want a 4-inch smartphone, and for them, there will possibly never be another device that brings such high processing power within such small a form factor. That, though, will be a very small section of the population. The 4.7-inch display on the iPhone 6s feels just the right size, and it excels in terms of ergonomics, too. For first-time iPhone users, a large section of them will probably be looking to migrate from the ocean of Android-powered devices, where spotting a screen smaller than 5 inches is nearly impossible. The smallest that comes to my mind is the Sony Xperia Z5 Compact with a 4.6-inch display panel, and it is highly improbable for users of the Z5 Compact to look to switch to the iPhone SE., For existing users, it is from the still-sizeable section of iPhone 5/5c/5s users, and some iPhone 4s users. From an iPhone 4s, or even from an iPhone 5/5c, this is certainly a respectable upgrade in every possible aspect. As for iPhone 5s users, I’m not entirely convinced, with the iPhone 6s in hand. The cost plays a major role, and we’ll discuss this later. But from the point of view of sheer usage, the natural step for most users of the 4-inch device is to upgrade to a 4.7-inch one. Yes, the 4-inch display is still excellent in terms of quality, but the size definitely feels restricted., Build and Design
The iPhone SE is built on the same chassis as the iPhone 5s was, which according to me was the best iPhone design till date. It is 7.6mm in thickness, and weighs 113 grams. It has a familiar design and is built well enough, but somehow feels slightly less sturdy than the iPhone 5s. The tried-and-tested rectangular design still looks good, and the iPhone SE retains the premium feel usually related to iPhones., , Ergonomically, this is by far one of the best devices around. One-handed typing is a breeze here, something that we do not mention too often in our reviews. The sharp edges do cut into palms on long-term usage, but the pleasure of owning a smartphone that feels inconspicuous in pockets is a rare luxury nowadays. For anyone who is a fan of compact devices, the iPhone SE is as good as it can get. The only element that Apple has changed here is the colour of the logo on the rear. The iPhone 5s had a stainless steel logo across all colour variants, while the iPhone SE’s logo is of the colour of its make. It is a minor difference, but does add slightly to the flow of the phone’s design., Performance
Apple has fit the iPhone SE with present generation hardware — the A9 processor with M9 motion co-processor and 2GB of RAM. We ran benchmarks on the iPhone SE in tandem with the iPhone 5s and iPhone 6s, along with the latest generation of Android-powered flagships, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and Xiaomi Mi 5. The iPhone SE leads the pack in terms of frames rendered in the graphic tests, and even heads in terms of single-core processing power. In terms of multi-core processing, however, the Galaxy S7 Edge and Xiaomi Mi 5 lead, powered by the octa-core Exynos 8890 and quad-core Snapdragon 820 respectively., , In real life, the iPhone SE performs like a flagship smartphone. It is a delight in terms of everyday usage - most apps open without any delay, Spotlight search is smooth as always, always-on Hey Siri does add to the functionality, and gaming is quite enjoyable. Graphics rendered look crisp and rich, and thanks to the smaller display, the hexa-core PowerVR GT7600 GPU has lesser screen area to provide for, hence leading to higher frame rates that aid smoother gameplay. The presence of 2GB RAM reflects here, as the iPhone SE is completely free from the split-second delays that were present when unlocking the device, switching between apps and other regular actions., The iPhone SE is an able performer, and can handle multiple tasks with ease. For more detailed analysis, check the performance comparison of the iPhone SE. Coming to the operating system, iOS 9.3.1 is a fast, stable environment that faces slight hints of stutter on the iPhone 5s, but here, it is incredibly swift. While Touch ID does miss a tap every 10th time, it is not massively disrupting an aspect. It is, however, important, seeing the efficiency of Android’s integrated Imprint fingerprint sensor. To reiterate, the iPhone SE happens to be one of the best devices in terms of performance, running at par with the likes of iPhone 6s and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, and even beating them in a few areas., , Camera
It is here that the iPhone SE does not remain one of the best. In terms of everyday photographs, the iPhone SE is decent, rendering true-to-source colours without any hint of oversaturation or accentuated contrasts. Focussing is fast, and shutter response is smooth. Unfortunately, while the photographs are not disappointing, the iPhone SE does not seem to be in the same league as flagships like the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, or even the iPhone 6s Plus. It reportedly uses the same image sensor as the iPhone 6s, although it misses out optical image stabilisation., , In terms of image quality, while it will suffice in terms of everyday usage and rapid shooting, the iPhone SE is not as good as the two devices mentioned above. It has decent levels of detail, sharpness and clarity, but lacks in low light capability as images tend to become noisy. While the front camera may have suffered significantly because of this, the addition of Retina Flash solves the issue of taking selfies in the dark. The iPhone SE also gets Live Photos, if you would want them. Check out the image gallery below for camera samples., Battery Stamina
While Apple has advertised improved battery life on the iPhone SE than other devices, it is still nowhere close to the best in class. Upon average usage, while I end up charging the iPhone 5s more than twice, the brand new iPhone SE easily saw me through the day, with about 18% battery left on Low Power Mode. This would deplete, if you were to game on it for about half an hour, and extensively stream music on the go. On our Geekbench battery test, the iPhone SE lasted for about four and half hours, which is strikingly low. It surely fares better on everyday usage, but brace yourself for dropping battery stamina upon extended usage, and the constant need of a power bank. Flagship phones like the S7 Edge and Xiaomi Mi 5 break the 8 hours barrier on the same test., Overall
It sure is a flagship, and a powerful one at that, but the screen is what creates the dilemma. While there may still be a considerable section of 4-inch device lovers, the numbers are steadily decreasing, and with most of our daily usage shifting to videos, a 4-inch device does feel rather restricted. It is a bold, bright flagship, but the price creates an issue here. At Rs. 39,000, the iPhone SE is barely less expensive than the iPhone 6s. If you have the option of paying about Rs. 3,000 more and getting a bigger display with 3D Touch along with a decently ergonomic build, why would you go for a smaller display?, The iPhone SE may be the perfect upgrade for users of the iPhone 4s, and for ones who really do not want a larger smartphone. It may also be the last flagship-class smartphone with a display as small as 4 inches. If you qualify under any of the two criteria above, the iPhone SE is your best bet. For everyone else, the iPhone 6s is the smartphone to own. Like all iPhones, the iPhone SE is great, but it's about time Apple recognised its competition., Check our video review of the iPhone SE here:, "

2272,42,apple-iphone-xr-256gb-review-137217,0,0,2019-04-13,137217,Swapnil Mathur,Apple iPhone XR 256GB Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/apple-iphone-xr-256gb-review-137217.html,"The iPhone XR sports Apple's fastest processor yet, the A12 Bionic chip and comes with a near-bezel-less design. However minor things like the lack of an HD display, no dual camera and a terribly limited portrait mode makes the smartphone feel like an unnecessarily overpriced device., , Apple’s September 12th keynote saw the world be introduced to the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, Apple’s new “standard” for the iPhone. But what the company also announced was the iPhone XR, a third iPhone that’s an amalgamation of all the things, good and bad, that came before it. Apple pegged the $750 iPhone XR as the device through which they will be able to reach out to newer customers. It has a number of tricks up its sleeve and misses the mark on a few things, so let’s see if this Rs 76900-rupee pocket computer is worth your (or your rich parents’) hard earned money., Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, Apple hasn’t deviated much from what they include in the box of the new iPhone. While expectations were high about an included fast charger or a USB-C to Lightning, sadly, no such items are in the box. In fact, Apple has gone ahead and removed the Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack converter. Here’s everything that Apple includes in the box of the iPhone XR., The minute you lay your eyes on the iPhone XR, you get a flashback to the iPhone 5C. The XR comes in a multitude of colours (6 to be exact), of which all but silver and black are worth your time. Personally, I was partial to the Coral finish, but unfortunately, we were allotted a black unit of the iPhone XR. The colours are a unique aspect of the iPhone XR’s design, in fact, it’s the most prominent aspect of the phone and on that account, we have sadly been shortchanged. Anyhow. The anodized aluminium has a matte finish unlike the glossy one found on the iPhone XS, so that’s good. The back of the iPhone XR is treated with the same colour treatment as the frame, but the colouring is done below the glass back. The glass back still attracts fingerprints like every other phone with a glass back, but the aluminium frame does feel very solid and easy to get a grip on., , Unlike the iPhone XS and XS Max which are IP68 rated, the iPhone XR has an IP67 rating, meaning it can withstand being submerged under water up to a depth of 1 meter for a maximum of 30 minutes. Apple says that even though this isn’t IP68 rated, they have tested the iPhone XR to be resistant to the usual suspects such as beer, juice, soft drinks etc. Looking at the iPhone XR from the front, you will be hard-pressed to distinguish it from the X-series. Apple has unified the design across its entire smartphone range for 2018, which means that you get a premium design found on the super expensive iPhone XS on an iPhone that costs 25 percent less., The iPhone XR’s display is the first sign of where the phone takes a huge step back. The iPhone XR has a 6.1-inch IPS-LCD display which Apple calls “Liquid Retina” and is apparently the best LCD display the company has produced to date. With a resolution of 1792x828, the display has a pixel density of 326ppi. For some reason, Apple thought it was a good idea to increase the display size over the iPhone 8 Plus but reduce the resolution so that the pixel density matches that of the iPhone 8. It is a little bothersome that a phone that costs more than the iPhone 8 Plus at launch doesn’t even have an HD screen. If you’re a “by-the-numbers” kind of person, you may not appreciate this. The iPhone XR has slightly thicker bezels than the iPhone XS, but honestly, it is in no way a detriment., To test the display’s adeptness for daily use, we tested out the quality of video playback across YouTube, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. YouTube allowed me to select the playback resolution for all the videos all the way up to 4K, but the playback resolution will always be limited to the 720p. If you have anything above the very basic Netflix plan, get ready to be disappointed at the lack of pixels and HDR. It pinched a little to know that someone would spend Rs 76900 on the iPhone XR and not be able to make the most of their Netflix subscription. Despite the shortfall in the number, watching content on the iPhone XR’s display feels satisfactory, with very impressive colour reproduction. Black levels too are fairly good, despite the LCD panel which generally isn’t capable of rendering true blacks., , The display is very legible under bright lights with minimal reflectance. It isn’t as bright as the iPhone XS’s panel, but it’s still bright enough for you to go about your daily activities such as playing games, texting, emailing, browsing social media etc without any problems., While content looks good on the iPhone XR, put it next to an iPhone XS or even the similarly sized Samsung Galaxy S9 and you will start to see the impact of the less-than-HD resolution. Even the LG G7+ ThinQ offers an IPS-LCD display, but with 2K resolution and an HDR10 enabled panel. It’s even brighter than the iPhone XR’s display and costs Rs 40,000. At this point, the iPhone XR is the only flagship of 2018 which doesn’t even sport an HD display and that, frankly, is disappointing. The display is definitely functional, you don’t feel like you’re viewing content on a “poor quality” display, but you do definitely notice the lower resolution, but only if you have regular access to a smartphone with a higher resolution (2K or above) display. For anyone who cares, the iPhone XR’s display doesn’t have Force Touch either. I personally love the feature and it is just weird to not see a feature which was present in the previous generation of the iPhone., ~Performance is one area where the iPhone XR makes significant leaps forward. The XR is powered by the same A12 Bionic processor as the more expensive iPhone XS (Review). The new A12 Bionic is manufactured on the 7nm process, making it not only more powerful than the 10nm counterpart, but also more power-efficient. In that regard, the iPhone XR does not disappoint. Throughout the benchmarks, the iPhone XR maintained its lead over all Android flagships and matched the performance of the far more expensive iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max (Review)., , , When it comes to real-world performance, you’d be hard pressed to differentiate between the iPhone XR and the far more expensive models. Whether it's editing the RAW files from the camera or playing PubG, you will not find a single reason to be unhappy. There is literally nothing that makes the iPhone XR slow down, although, the phone does tend to heat up under heavy use. I observed that after 15 minutes of playing Asphalt 9, the area just below the camera module did get pretty hot. I repeated the test several times over the last few weeks using Asphalt 9, Fortnite and also Injustice 2 and noticed that heating, in general, is an issue. The phone doesn’t get hot enough to cause alarm, but it did get warm enough for us to take notice since most flagships that have been tested in our test lab in the last few months have not had such an issue., Overall, as a daily driver, the iPhone XR is nothing short of a thoroughbred when it comes to performance. It does not give into any app and cuts through even the most demanding workloads like a hot knife through butter., The camera, in some ways, again feels like a slight step back when considering the iPhone XR. You only get a single camera on the back, a 12-megapixel sensor paired with an optically stabilized f/1.8 lens. The new sensor has more phase detect pixels now for better focusing and a wicked smartHDR algorithm that takes imaging to the next level. Apple has decided to omit the telephoto lens from the XR, as a means of making sure you remember that you bought the “cheaper” iPhone., , When it comes to sensor performance, again, the wide-angle lens delivers results at par with the iPhone XS. The photos from daytime are well lit, with the exposure well balanced to accommodate the highlights and the shadows. For well-lit scenarios, the iPhone XR does exceedingly well. Even in low light, the imaging stack is no slouch, with the results looking properly exposed, but lacking in detail due to aggressive noise reduction., 
The iPhone XR's 26mm wide-angle camera is capable of capturing great photos in good light, 
Indoor shots with average (or higher) amount of lighting come out looking good, The iPhone XR also happens to offer portrait mode on a single lens, but unlike what we see on the Google Pixel smartphones, this one is purely a machine-learning based solution and not a great one at that. For starters, the field of view in Portrait Mode remains that of the wide-angle lens. While this isn’t a make-or-break by itself, what will be a deal breaker for many is the fact that Portrait Mode only works if there is a person in the frame. Even then, there are distance-based limitations. What this means is that you cannot use Portrait Mode on the iPhone XR to shoot nice photos of objects or anything that’s not a human being. I take a lot of photos of my dog and not being able to shoot him in Portrait Mode was a huge bummer. However, there are some third-party developers who are working on bringing Portrait Mode for pets and objects to the iPhone XR, but there’s no word on when this would actually happen. The iPhone XR does offer three of the five portrait lighting mode, so that’s good., 
Portrait Mode is limited to shooting human faces only, Regardless, the iPhone XR does take marvellous images, but the lack of a secondary camera is definitely going to pinch, especially given that the XR is priced the same as last year’s iPhone 8 Plus. If you must have a secondary lens, then you have no choice but to go for the more expensive iPhone XS., The iPhone XR offers the exact same front-facing setup as the more expensive iPhone XS, so that is a step forward. There’s a 7-megapixel camera with a f/2.2 lens which is augmented by a depth sensor for portrait mode. Honestly, the front-facing camera does a far better job at portraits than the rear camera, thanks to hardware that allows for the camera to capture more than just pixels. The result is images worthy of not just Instagram, but also perhaps display photos across whatever platform or even prints. The front facing camera also offers autofocus which is great if you’re taking photos in tricky conditions, such as dense crowds. There’s very little reason to be unhappy with the performance of the iPhone XR’s front-facing camera, seeing how it performs at par with the more expensive iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max., , , , The iPhone XR comes toting a 2952mAh battery which lasted 8 hours and 15 minutes on the Geekbench battery test. In real life, the phone’s battery easily lasted a day and a half, despite the LCD display. The lowered resolution of the panel probably stems the battery drain, but the A12 Bionic chipset can also be attributed to the impressive battery life. Basically, despite the bigger display and using an LCD panel at that, the iPhone XR manages to last longer than the iPhone XS, and almost as long as the iPhone XR., The Apple iPhone XR is supposed to be the ""affordable iPhone"" and in the spirit of that, Apple has removed a few features as a means of incentivising people to go for the higher end iPhone XS or the iPhone XS Max. While you don't get the dual-camera setup or even a full HD display, you do get the fastest processor in the smartphone world right now to cut through any demanding task. The 64GB Apple iPhone XR still makes sense for people who may be upgrading from the iPhone 6 or earlier, but the higher storage variants make even less sense. The 256GB variant which we reviewed costs Rs 91,900 just a few thousand short of the iPhone XS which is a no-compromise smartphone. The base variant of the iPhone XR costs Rs 76900 and for the price, there are enough Android counterparts which offer a no-compromise feature-set. If you are someone who's tied into the Apple eco-system and refuse to go outside of it, and if you have one of the older iPhones, then you could consider the iPhone XR. However, even when paying such a premium, you will have to accept the absence of certain essentials features."
2273,42,apple-iphone-xs-512gb-review-137175,0,0,2019-04-02,137175,Swapnil Mathur,Apple iPhone XS 512GB Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/apple-iphone-xs-512gb-review-137175.html,"The Apple iPhone XS is powered by an impressively fast A-12 Bionic chip, features an HDR10 and Dolby Vision certified display and continues to take great photos and videos. However, the iPhone XS with its average battery life and the astronomical price isn't a smartphone for everyone., , There was a lot of excitement around the launch of the iPhone this year. There were so many ways Apple could approach this launch and so many possible announcements they could make, but as the dates got closer, leaks and rumours had pretty much-revealed everything there was to know about the upcoming iPhones. What was however surprising was the iPhone X lineup now becoming the “default” iPhone, and that its pricing would start from $999. From being a $700 smartphone, the iPhone was now a thousand-dollar luxury item. However, unlike the previous generation siblings (iPhone 8/8Plus) you’re not losing any essential features between the iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max. The only two differences between the two devices is the screen size (and hence the resolution) and the battery capacity. For the first time, choosing the smaller variant won’t mean losing a camera or other essential features. Sadly, you’re still going to pay a premium for this luxury. If you’re on the fence about the iPhone XS, you should read on to find some clarity, one way or the other., Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, The iPhone XS, just like the iPhone XS Max, is constructed using two panes of the strongest glass “Apple has ever used in a smartphone” sandwiched using “surgical grade” stainless steel. There’s no actual clear definition of what constitutes “surgical grade stainless steel,” except that it should be corrosion resistant. It sure does sound fancy though. The glass front and back are fairly resistant to fingerprint smudges though, more than most flagships in my experience, so that is good. The iPhone XS is 5.65 inches tall and 2.79 inches wide. For someone like me who has average sized hands, the phone is easy to hold and use, even with a single hand. I put the phone in a case soon after it was set up and even though that adds a few millimetres of bulk to the overall width and thickness, its one-handed usability is not impacted., Part of the built quality of the iPhone XS is its IP68 rating and the additional claims of Apple having tested the phones against common liquids such as coffee, beer, juice etc. We dunked our review unit of the iPhone XS Max into a bowl full of water, Pepsi, coffee and even Mazaa for extended periods of time, yet the phone continued to work. There is no reason to doubt that the iPhone XS will have the same level of resistance to liquids, although we strongly recommend not abusing the limits of how far the iPhone can go. But its safe to assume that the phone will easily withstand accidental spills and the occasional push into the pool., , When it comes to design, you will be hard pressed to find any differences between this year’s iPhone XS and last year’s iPhone X. The two phones utilize identical external design and as such if you do buy the phone, don’t expect anyone to know you’re holding the newer of the two phones unless you get the new gold variant. We received the Space Gray variant, which is identical to the last year’s model. In fact, most cases that were made for the iPhone X will be usable on the iPhone XS as well. However, there has been a very tiny change in the size of the camera module so ‘some’ cases may not fit snug against the camera bump.          , Overall, the design of the iPhone XS is the same as last year’s and its one of those “take it or leave it” situations. I don’t mind the same design honestly, because if there is anything I have realized, it’s that the iPhone XS is very easy to use with one hand., The iPhone XS features a 5.8-inch bezel-less display, fitted into a 5.65-inch form-factor thanks to the 19.5:9 aspect ratio. The display sports an unconventional resolution of 1125x2436 which puts the display’s pixel density at roughly 458 ppi. But you don’t really need to care about that., What you should care about is that the OLED panel that comprises the iPhone XS’s display is one of the best displays on a smartphone. It supports HDR10 like last year, but this year also gains Dolby Vision certification. It is a beautiful display whether it is for consuming content or creating it. The display is surprisingly accurate even with True Tone enabled. Content is easily visible even in bright daylight and if you’re in bed, you can dim the display all the way to 2 nits for an easy viewing experience in pitch dark., OLED panels inherently are absolutely beautiful two looks at, but they do have 2 problems. The first is the problem of ghosting and isn’t too much of a concern at this point. The second is the colour shift that OLED panels exhibit which was markedly horrible in the Pixel 2XL. This colour shift appears when the phone is held off-axis from the eyes, making parts of the screen change colour from a warm tone to a blue tint, or vice-versa. The review unit of the iPhone XS we tested only showed the colour shift when the phone was held at extreme angles, which is totally normal of OLED panels., , Suffice to say, you’re getting one of the best displays in the market with the iPhone XS. However, in order to take full advantage of this display, you’re going to have access to tons of HDR content. Great if you have the premium tier of Netflix subscription or are willing to rent or buy HDR content from the iTunes store. Honestly, though, it just feels nice to view photos and even well-produced YouTube content on the iPhone XS. There’s absolutely no fault to be found with the iPhone XS display., When it comes to performance, Apple has hit it out of the park and how. The new A-12 Bionic chip that powers the iPhone XS is a testament to big things coming in small packages. The 7nm fabrication process has allowed Apple to squeeze out big performance and decent power efficiency out of the chip. While we’ll talk about the battery in a later section, let's get to the performance numbers., The A-12 Bionic chip allowed the iPhone XS to blaze past all other Android flagships of the year in almost every benchmark. Whether it was Geekbench 4 (4692 on single core and 10997 on multi-core) or 3DMark (3598 on Sling Shot), the iPhone XS (just like the iPhone XS Max) is far ahead of every flagship in the market right now., , , What this results in is speedy performance especially when opening, closing or switching apps. Since the iPhone XS now solely relies on gestures for navigating through the user interface, the phone cannot afford to have any kind of lag. This is in addition to the fact that no matter what game or task you run on the iPhone XS, it is all going to run butter smooth., I played Fortnite, Asphalt 9 and a bunch of indie-games like Monument Valley 2, Rings and Ridiculous Fishing without the iPhone XS so much as breaking a sweat. The iPhone XS barely got warm during 30-minute spurts of gaming sessions. Even photo editing was a breeze, including editing RAW files in  Adobe Lightroom. Given that our review unit of last year’s iPhone X still works like a charm, we expect the iPhone XS with its impressively powerful A-12 Bionic chip to last a while before it starts to show signs of ageing., Every year, the iPhone sees an improvement in its camera, but it's not every year that the changes are in both hardware and software. We still get dual sensors with 12-megapixel resolution each, with the wide 26mm lens sporting a f/1.8 aperture while the 52mm telephoto lens has an aperture of f/2.4. The hardware improvement here is the new imaging sensors, which also come with far more phase detect pixels than the previous cameras. Larger apertures would have been great to have, but Apple is compensating for that with software., This time, we are seeing the biggest show of Apple’s use of computational photography. Apple has introduced SmartHDR a technique where the phone shoots intra-frames between the standard tri-shot that makes up an HDR photo. Then using machine learning, the ISP fuses the best parts of all the frames together to deliver the final shot. In order to test the camera on the iPhone XS, we went out and shot over 300 frames in order to determine just how well the camera actually works. Suffice to say, it left us impressed. The autofocus is definitely fast and requires little nudging to lock onto the right subject. There were two occasions where the performance took a hit; one in extremely low light and the other time when trying to focus on a plant with dense foliage. Regardless, a little re-tapping on the screen nudged the focus in the right direction., Coming to imaging performance, daytime performance is absolutely stellar. The colours are gorgeous and the photos are generally missing the usual HDR halation that occurs under strong lighting. Details are impressive for objects that are shot up close, but landscape shots show a little loss in detail for distant objects. For example, the detail in the fur of my dog is definitely impressive, but when taking landscape shots, the leaves in the distant trees look a little smudged., , , When it comes to low light situations, you can expect the iPhone XS to take good photos all the way to ISO 1600. Once the sun goes down, or you move indoors into poor lighting, the iPhone is quick to boost the ISO, especially if SmartHDR is enabled. The downside to the high ISO numbers is aggressive noise reduction which tends to smudge out more detail for anyone’s liking. Photos of people will render extremely smooth skin and if you’re shooting something colourful, there’s a chance the colour patches would end up looking like paint splotches. Turning SmartHDR off will improve performance by a little bit, but it could be the difference between a usable photo for social media versus something you wouldn’t want to put out in the world., The Portrait Mode on the iPhone XS now features a virtual aperture control slider that will allow you to determine just how much background blur you want in the image. While the images look good for the most part, Apple’s implementation of portrait mode is still limited by distance. The subject you are shooting has to be 10 feet away and if they’re any closer, the camera app will not be able to shoot a portrait. This puts limits on the framing possibilities. However, if you do adhere to the rules, you will end up with some very impressive looking photos. The background blur is soft and if there are strong sources of light in the background, you will see circles in the bokeh. However, the subject-background separation still isn’t perfect and more often than not, you will find imperfections around the subject’s edges., , The 7-megapixel front-facing camera does a great job of taking selfies, but some users might find the 32mm field of view limiting. Regardless, the faceID hardware doubles up as a tool for enabling portrait mode for the front camera. Portrait shots from the front camera are quite pleasing and have better edge separation. Otherwise, images come out looking gorgeous with the right amount of saturation and the right kind of white balance dialed in. There’s been some controversy over an alleged beauty mode that softens the skin, but that is just not true. Yes, the skin has lesser detail than what we’ve seen on previous generation iPhones, however, this is due to SmartHDR and not because of some secret beauty mode. Because to make SmartHDR work, the ISO has to be bumped up, when the final image is processed, some noise reduction is also applied to it, causing the softening in the skin. Apple did say they are working on fixing this, but honestly, its not a deal breaker. What does work well for the front-facing camera is the optical image stabilization which comes in very handy when shooting video using the selfie camera., Overall, the imaging performance of the iPhone XS is spending, scoring well into the top league. While the camera app itself offers quite a number of features, the best way to get the most out of the iPhone XS’s sensor would be by using a third party app like Halide or Camera +2., Apple is known to never put high capacity batteries in their smartphones. In comparison to Android counterparts, this has always been a sore point and with the iPhone XS, things are no different. You get a 2658mAh battery which Apple claims is going to last you 30 minutes more than the iPhone X. While GeekBench’s battery test gave the iPhone XS a run time 5 hours and 35 minutes. The numbers don’t inspire confidence, but in day to day usage, the phone does manage to just about make it through a busy workday., Having used the iPhone XS as my primary device for some time, it is safe to say that the battery life will make you stress a bit towards the end of the day. This is on days with heavy usage which involves about 4 hours of music playback, taking about 10-15 photos a day and 4 hours of phone calls. There’s also the long WhatsApp conversations so you would have a general idea of how things go during the day. Thanks to wireless charging, I am occasionally able to top the phone up a bit during the day. Suffice to say, the battery life on the iPhone XS isn’t the best in the league it competes in, so if you are going to invest in a phone this expensive, do ensure you buy a battery pack as well., The iPhone XS is an absolute beast when it comes to performance. The new A-12 Bionic chip performs far beyond what the Snapdragon 845 today is capable of. The display is definitely serious eye-candy and the cameras themselves are great. What’s not so great is the battery life, and the price tag of Rs 1,34,900, which seems far too high for a smartphone. While this is definitely a powerful device, it is hard to justify spending a small car’s down-payment on a smartphone. The iPhone XS isn’t for everyone. It is for those for whom price is no object, and for those who can actually afford the price tag."
2244,42,asus-zenfone-max-pro-m1-64gb-review-130555,0,0,2019-05-22,130555,Subhrojit Mallick,Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 64GB Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/asus-zenfone-max-pro-m1-64gb-review-130555.html,"The Asus Zenfone Max Pro can take on the best in the market with ease. Like most Asus phones, the spec-sheet is maxed out with the best mid-range hardware. That includes latest stock Android and a 5,000mAh battery, two features which solve the biggest pain points people tend to have when making a purchase at that price range. The phone even manages to take on the formidable Redmi Note 5 Pro, save for the imaging prowess, but the pros easily outweigh the cons. In all, it’s always good to have a choice of clean stock UI without compromising on the performance., , The mid-range market is now dominated by Xiaomi. There’s one Redmi phone for every price point in that segment and the consumer is essentially spoilt for choice. However, Redmi phones are notorious for getting sold out in seconds. Getting your hands on one is a matter of pure luck. But then again, we have always recommended  our readers to wait and try their luck because no other phonemaker has been able to match up to the quality Xiaomi assures in its products. That is, until now., Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, The Asus Zenfone Max Pro is a breath of fresh air in a market that is otherwise inundated with Xiaomi phones. Asus’ offering matches Xiaomi’s most premium mid-range offering feature-by-feature and for the most part, can be considered an equal. Except, the Max Pro runs on stock Android UI while the Redmi Note 5 Pro is of course powered by MIUI. There’s nothing wrong with using MIUI, but there’s a certain simplicity and comfort in using stock Android. It’s familiar to anyone who has used an Android device and is efficient enough to not tax the processor. Considering how the UI is the most frequent aspect of the phone a user will interact with, it counts a lot, and in this case, Asus’ choice makes the Zenfone Max Pro a force to reckon with. What’s better is that the phone is much cheaper than the Redmi Note 5 Pro and will be available more easily than the Redmi Note 5 Pro., , The question then remains, did Asus finally crack the formula to make a reliable mid-range phone? With the Zenfone Max Pro, it certainly seems so. It has everything you can ask for at the price — The latest mid-range chipset, tall 18:9 display, dual cameras and a massive 5,000mAh battery. In this review, we find out whether all the features work as advertised, and more importantly, does it make sense to buy this over the Redmi Note 5 Pro? Read on., Design, Taller displays aren’t new anymore and neither is the metal unibody design most mid-range smartphones like to sport. The Zenfone Max Pro is yet another iteration of the same design philosophy. The display takes up most of the real estate up front while at the back the dual camera module is vertically aligned at the top left corner. The fingerprint sensor is conveniently placed in the center where the finger can easily reach it. The form factor with a thinner display is naturally ergonomic and the rounded corners makes the phone sit plush in the hand., , Like most other mid-range phones, the Zenfone Max Pro also deploys a 2.5D curved glass that bends ever so slightly to meet the metal frame. Asus has polished the rear plate to give a soft matte finish that does tend to get dirty when used with sweaty hands but isn’t a fingerprint magnet. There are two colour variants to choose from — Meteor Silver and Deepsea Black. Both look equally good and you’ll be hard pressed to make a choice. There’s colour-matched polycarbonate antenna lines to enhance network reception., , I particularly liked the fact that the dual camera module is flush with the body and there’s no camera bump, which has become an eyesore in most smartphones. There’s also no need to make a choice between a second SIM card and a microSD card as the phone houses dedicated slots for all three. In the mid-range market, that counts as a lot since most users tend to use a secondary SIM card and rely on expanded storage., The design of the Zenfone Max Pro isn’t going to get points for being innovative, but it does comes across as well-built and functional. The added heft, thanks to the massive 5,000mAh battery provides a good grip and the minimalist body makes the display the center of attraction., Display, The Zenfone Max Pro could have been easily lost in a sea of smartphones with an 18:9 display, if not for the superior quality of the panel. Like most other mid-rangers, this too relies on a 6-inch FHD+ IPS LCD panel, housed in a 5.5-inch body. While the idea isn’t as innovative as before, the usefulness remains. There’s less scrolling while browsing the web, while gaming on the widescreen allows for easier controls. Split-screen on the display is particularly useful as the screen gets divided into two equal halves., For bedtime use, Asus offers a blue-light filter as well as a slider to adjust the colour temperature., , Asus claims to have used Qualcomm’s TruPallette and Ecopix display technology  to render a higher contrast ratio of 1500:1, which shows when you watch something on the screen. The blues and the greens look saturated with high contrast while skin tones are made more accurate. It’s still no match for an AMOLED panel though in terms of contrast ratios, but the colour are more vibrant than its closest competitor — The Redmi Note 5 Pro., Performance and UI, Asus’ choice of using the latest hardware and stock Android will keep this phone in the limelight for some time to come. The Zenfone Max Pro is powered by the Snapdragon 636 chipset, the one introduced by Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 5 Pro in the mid-range segment which effectively blew the competition away., The 14nm chipset builds on top of the popular and reliable Snapdragon 625, offering a 50 percent jump in performance over its predecessor. That’s possible even after the max clock speed has been reduced to 1.8GHz from 2.0GHz in the SD625. It’s because the SD636 uses Qualcomm’s custom Kryo cores which is also used in the flagship 8-series chipsets, allowing the CPU to provide more power for longer without compromising on battery efficiency.,  ,  , The benchmark results also narrate the same story. There’s almost a 50 percent jump in AnTuTu score from the Redmi Note 5 (which uses the SD625) while the Redmi Note 5 Pro (which uses the SD636) is almost at par, edging the Zenfone Max Pro out by roughly 50 points. The 3DMark Slingshot score which takes the GPU into account gave identical scores, indicating the graphical prowess of the two phones is at par. The reason why the Redmi Note 5 Pro edges this phone out is because Xiaomi offers 6GB of RAM with the phone while Asus’ offering sticks with 3GB of RAM. There’s also 32GB of onboard storage to boot, which is again expandable., The Snapdragon 636 on the Zenfone Max Pro also brings support for Bluetooth 4.2 with Qualcomm’s AptX technology for clearer audio over wireless connections. The mono speaker on the phone is quite loud as well, thanks to a built-in NXP amplifier and a 5-magnet speaker. What’s irksome is the positioning of the speaker. Despite being loud, holding the phone horizontally muffles the sound as the hand grips the phone right where the speaker is., , But more than the hardware underneath, the reason the Zenfone Max Pro is such a good performer is because of stock Android. The phone runs on stock Android 8.1 with the February security patch. The lightweight Android, as designed by Google is known to offer minimum interference to performance with a clean and simple user interface. Those upgrading from a Moto G5 or the Mi A1 will feel right at home. There’s hardly any bloatware save for a third-party payment app and Asus promises version updates less than two months after Google pushes it out., Camera, While the Zenfone Max Pro matches the competition in every other aspect, the camera leaves a lot to be desired. It’s not a bad camera per se, but photos from phones like the Redmi Note 5 Pro has spoilt me. The Zenfone Max Pro features dual cameras at the back — A 13-megapixel primary sensor and a 5-megapixel depth-sensing unit. The camera is placed at the top left corner with a single LED flash right beneath it. The primary camera has an aperture of f/2.2 with 1.0um pixel pitch., , The camera specs are mostly the same as the Redmi Note 5 Pro, which is our best-ranking mid-range phone currently, but the results are not the same. Photos from the Zenfone Max Pro are average, to say the least. That wow factor is missing. Highlights get clipped often and details in the textures isn’t as prominent as the best in the market. It’s still better than most other mid-rangers, but if you’re looking for the absolute best, it’s best to try your luck in getting the Note 5 Pro., , The camera UI on the Zenfone Max Pro is somewhat cluttery and isn't quite aesthetically pleasing as in other phones by Moto or Xiaomi. Asus deployed Qualcomm's stock camera app which does offer a range of scenes to choose, as well as filters, but most options like the pro-mode are cluttered inside the settings page, making it a hassle to adjust the settings manually., Daylight, , , Any mid-range phones will take decent daytime shots with ample light pouring into the frame.  So does the Zenfone Max Pro. You will get well-lit photos which are bright and vibrant. The colour temperature does tend towards the warmer side, but they look aesthetically pleasing regardless. But as I mentioned above, the camera isn’t a match for the Redmi Note 5 Pro. Highlights tend to get overexposed when exposing for the shadows and details are lost in the shadows when trying to prioritise highlights. The dynamic range leaves a lot to be desired., Indoor, , The photos taken indoors highlight the weaknesses of the camera. There’s an ugly glare from the incandescent source of light when taking photos indoors, while close-up shots are somewhat well-lit but aren’t as sharp. The white balance is more accurate though, as compared to the Redmi Note 5 Pro, which is definitely a good thing., Macro, , Close-up shots, taken in daylight will result in well-detailed, sharp macro shots. In the photo below, the details in the flower are well-preserved while the colour of the flower came out a little more saturated, yet not as much as the Redmi Note 5 Pro., Low-light, , The camera on the Zenfone Max Pro isn’t conducive for use in low-light. There’s considerable noise in the photos. The shadows are practically blackened and whatever area is lit is mired in grains. To be frank though, most mid-rangers aren’t capable of good low-light shots and this one is just the same., Portrait Shots, , Bokeh shots are ever so popular now and phones like the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Mi A1 are known to be masters at it. The Zenfone Max Pro tries hard to match up to that level, but doesn’t quite make it. There’s ample blurring, yes, but the blurring is inconsistent and the portrait comes across as being heavily edited on Snapseed. You also cannot control the amount of blurring, something that Honor phones do provide., Front Camera, , The Zenfone Max Pro sports an 8-megapixel shooter with F/2.0 aperture combined with a soft LED flash. The selfies actually come out well-detailed with the right amount exposure and minimal beauty effects. It can also take portrait selfies and unlike other selfie-centric phones like the Oppo F7, the background isn’t overexposed to make the portrait stand out. The Max Pro manages to do it without clipping the background light., Battery, , One of the highlights of the Zenfone Max Pro is the 5,000mAh battery. Asus has managed to maintain a slim profile despite maxing out the battery capacity. It does help and combined with the power-efficient chipset and stock Android UI, the 5,000mAh battery can easily last the phone over a day and a half. PCMark’s 2.0 Battery test ran for 10 hours 39 minutes which easily converts to over a day of use. One of the main reason to recommend the phone is for the long battery life. Asus also bundles a fast charger with the device that can charge the phone to its full capacity in around 2 hours 30 minutes., Bottomline, The Asus Zenfone Max Pro may stands particularly because of the superior performance and the choice of stock Android at that price. There are other stock Android phones available at this price as well, but none of them pack so much firepower inside as the Zenfone Max Pro. It performs neck-to-neck with the Redmi Note 5 Pro, but Xiaomi’s offering far better in the camera department. But if you are a stickler for a hassle-free UI, superior performance and long battery life, this is the phone to go for. The fact that it’s also cheaper than the Redmi Note 5 Pro makes it a no-brainer. Also, unlike the Note 5 Pro, this one won’t be sold through flash sales, so availability is not going to be an issue. Combine that with Flipkart’s ‘Complete Mobile Protection’ for Rs 49, and Asus has a winner in its hands. If only the name was a little easier to say."

Like most Asus phones, the spec-sheet is maxed out with the best mid-range hardware. That includes latest stock Android and a 5,000mAh battery, two features which solve the biggest pain points people tend to have when making a purchase at that price range. The phone even manages to take on the formidable Redmi Note 5 Pro, save for the imaging prowess, but the pros easily outweigh the cons. In all, it’s always good to have a choice of clean stock UI without compromising on the performance., , The mid-range market is now dominated by Xiaomi. There’s one Redmi phone for every price point in that segment and the consumer is essentially spoilt for choice. However, Redmi phones are notorious for getting sold out in seconds. Getting your hands on one is a matter of pure luck. But then again, we have always recommended  our readers to wait and try their luck because no other phonemaker has been able to match up to the quality Xiaomi assures in its products. That is, until now., Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, The Asus Zenfone Max Pro is a breath of fresh air in a market that is otherwise inundated with Xiaomi phones. Asus’ offering matches Xiaomi’s most premium mid-range offering feature-by-feature and for the most part, can be considered an equal. Except, the Max Pro runs on stock Android UI while the Redmi Note 5 Pro is of course powered by MIUI. There’s nothing wrong with using MIUI, but there’s a certain simplicity and comfort in using stock Android. It’s familiar to anyone who has used an Android device and is efficient enough to not tax the processor. Considering how the UI is the most frequent aspect of the phone a user will interact with, it counts a lot, and in this case, Asus’ choice makes the Zenfone Max Pro a force to reckon with. What’s better is that the phone is much cheaper than the Redmi Note 5 Pro and will be available more easily than the Redmi Note 5 Pro., , The question then remains, did Asus finally crack the formula to make a reliable mid-range phone? With the Zenfone Max Pro, it certainly seems so. It has everything you can ask for at the price — The latest mid-range chipset, tall 18:9 display, dual cameras and a massive 5,000mAh battery. In this review, we find out whether all the features work as advertised, and more importantly, does it make sense to buy this over the Redmi Note 5 Pro? Read on., Design, Taller displays aren’t new anymore and neither is the metal unibody design most mid-range smartphones like to sport. The Zenfone Max Pro is yet another iteration of the same design philosophy. The display takes up most of the real estate up front while at the back the dual camera module is vertically aligned at the top left corner. The fingerprint sensor is conveniently placed in the center where the finger can easily reach it. The form factor with a thinner display is naturally ergonomic and the rounded corners makes the phone sit plush in the hand., , Like most other mid-range phones, the Zenfone Max Pro also deploys a 2.5D curved glass that bends ever so slightly to meet the metal frame. Asus has polished the rear plate to give a soft matte finish that does tend to get dirty when used with sweaty hands but isn’t a fingerprint magnet. There are two colour variants to choose from — Meteor Silver and Deepsea Black. Both look equally good and you’ll be hard pressed to make a choice. There’s colour-matched polycarbonate antenna lines to enhance network reception., , I particularly liked the fact that the dual camera module is flush with the body and there’s no camera bump, which has become an eyesore in most smartphones. There’s also no need to make a choice between a second SIM card and a microSD card as the phone houses dedicated slots for all three. In the mid-range market, that counts as a lot since most users tend to use a secondary SIM card and rely on expanded storage., The design of the Zenfone Max Pro isn’t going to get points for being innovative, but it does comes across as well-built and functional. The added heft, thanks to the massive 5,000mAh battery provides a good grip and the minimalist body makes the display the center of attraction., Display, The Zenfone Max Pro could have been easily lost in a sea of smartphones with an 18:9 display, if not for the superior quality of the panel. Like most other mid-rangers, this too relies on a 6-inch FHD+ IPS LCD panel, housed in a 5.5-inch body. While the idea isn’t as innovative as before, the usefulness remains. There’s less scrolling while browsing the web, while gaming on the widescreen allows for easier controls. Split-screen on the display is particularly useful as the screen gets divided into two equal halves., For bedtime use, Asus offers a blue-light filter as well as a slider to adjust the colour temperature., , Asus claims to have used Qualcomm’s TruPallette and Ecopix display technology  to render a higher contrast ratio of 1500:1, which shows when you watch something on the screen. The blues and the greens look saturated with high contrast while skin tones are made more accurate. It’s still no match for an AMOLED panel though in terms of contrast ratios, but the colour are more vibrant than its closest competitor — The Redmi Note 5 Pro., Performance and UI, Asus’ choice of using the latest hardware and stock Android will keep this phone in the limelight for some time to come. The Zenfone Max Pro is powered by the Snapdragon 636 chipset, the one introduced by Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 5 Pro in the mid-range segment which effectively blew the competition away., The 14nm chipset builds on top of the popular and reliable Snapdragon 625, offering a 50 percent jump in performance over its predecessor. That’s possible even after the max clock speed has been reduced to 1.8GHz from 2.0GHz in the SD625. It’s because the SD636 uses Qualcomm’s custom Kryo cores which is also used in the flagship 8-series chipsets, allowing the CPU to provide more power for longer without compromising on battery efficiency.,  ,  , The benchmark results also narrate the same story. There’s almost a 50 percent jump in AnTuTu score from the Redmi Note 5 (which uses the SD625) while the Redmi Note 5 Pro (which uses the SD636) is almost at par, edging the Zenfone Max Pro out by roughly 50 points. The 3DMark Slingshot score which takes the GPU into account gave identical scores, indicating the graphical prowess of the two phones is at par. The reason why the Redmi Note 5 Pro edges this phone out is because Xiaomi offers 6GB of RAM with the phone while Asus’ offering sticks with 3GB of RAM. There’s also 32GB of onboard storage to boot, which is again expandable., The Snapdragon 636 on the Zenfone Max Pro also brings support for Bluetooth 4.2 with Qualcomm’s AptX technology for clearer audio over wireless connections. The mono speaker on the phone is quite loud as well, thanks to a built-in NXP amplifier and a 5-magnet speaker. What’s irksome is the positioning of the speaker. Despite being loud, holding the phone horizontally muffles the sound as the hand grips the phone right where the speaker is., , But more than the hardware underneath, the reason the Zenfone Max Pro is such a good performer is because of stock Android. The phone runs on stock Android 8.1 with the February security patch. The lightweight Android, as designed by Google is known to offer minimum interference to performance with a clean and simple user interface. Those upgrading from a Moto G5 or the Mi A1 will feel right at home. There’s hardly any bloatware save for a third-party payment app and Asus promises version updates less than two months after Google pushes it out., Camera, While the Zenfone Max Pro matches the competition in every other aspect, the camera leaves a lot to be desired. It’s not a bad camera per se, but photos from phones like the Redmi Note 5 Pro has spoilt me. The Zenfone Max Pro features dual cameras at the back — A 13-megapixel primary sensor and a 5-megapixel depth-sensing unit. The camera is placed at the top left corner with a single LED flash right beneath it. The primary camera has an aperture of f/2.2 with 1.0um pixel pitch., , The camera specs are mostly the same as the Redmi Note 5 Pro, which is our best-ranking mid-range phone currently, but the results are not the same. Photos from the Zenfone Max Pro are average, to say the least. That wow factor is missing. Highlights get clipped often and details in the textures isn’t as prominent as the best in the market. It’s still better than most other mid-rangers, but if you’re looking for the absolute best, it’s best to try your luck in getting the Note 5 Pro., , The camera UI on the Zenfone Max Pro is somewhat cluttery and isn't quite aesthetically pleasing as in other phones by Moto or Xiaomi. Asus deployed Qualcomm's stock camera app which does offer a range of scenes to choose, as well as filters, but most options like the pro-mode are cluttered inside the settings page, making it a hassle to adjust the settings manually., Daylight, , , Any mid-range phones will take decent daytime shots with ample light pouring into the frame.  So does the Zenfone Max Pro. You will get well-lit photos which are bright and vibrant. The colour temperature does tend towards the warmer side, but they look aesthetically pleasing regardless. But as I mentioned above, the camera isn’t a match for the Redmi Note 5 Pro. Highlights tend to get overexposed when exposing for the shadows and details are lost in the shadows when trying to prioritise highlights. The dynamic range leaves a lot to be desired., Indoor, , The photos taken indoors highlight the weaknesses of the camera. There’s an ugly glare from the incandescent source of light when taking photos indoors, while close-up shots are somewhat well-lit but aren’t as sharp. The white balance is more accurate though, as compared to the Redmi Note 5 Pro, which is definitely a good thing., Macro, , Close-up shots, taken in daylight will result in well-detailed, sharp macro shots. In the photo below, the details in the flower are well-preserved while the colour of the flower came out a little more saturated, yet not as much as the Redmi Note 5 Pro., Low-light, , The camera on the Zenfone Max Pro isn’t conducive for use in low-light. There’s considerable noise in the photos. The shadows are practically blackened and whatever area is lit is mired in grains. To be frank though, most mid-rangers aren’t capable of good low-light shots and this one is just the same., Portrait Shots, , Bokeh shots are ever so popular now and phones like the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Mi A1 are known to be masters at it. The Zenfone Max Pro tries hard to match up to that level, but doesn’t quite make it. There’s ample blurring, yes, but the blurring is inconsistent and the portrait comes across as being heavily edited on Snapseed.

It is outperformed by competitors like the Redmi 3s Prime and Lenovo K6 Power, and doesn't make for a good buy., , When Coolpad first launched the Note 3 back in 2015, we quite liked what the device offered. You got a fingerprint sensor, 3GB RAM, and a well built device at a very reasonable Rs. 8,999. A year later, the company launched two new variants of the phone called the Coolpad Note 3 Lite, and Note 3 Plus. Now, the company has launched yet another variant of the device, called the Note 3S, priced at Rs. 9,999. However, the sub-Rs. 10,000 market is not what it was two years ago, the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime and the Lenovo K6 Power offer a lot of value to buyers, and Coolpad has to up the ante if it wants to take on these two., Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, , Design and Build, The Note 3S looks very different from the previous Note 3 branded devices. It is curvier than its predecessors and feels quite good in hand. It comes with 2.5D glass on the front, a plastic rear and a metal frame. At the top you get a 3.5mm audio jack and the Hybrid SIM slot, while the micro USB port is located at the bottom. The power button is located to the right, while the volume rocker is to the left. The device features non-backlit capacitive buttons., , , At the back, the 13MP camera has a slight bump, while the fingerprint sensor is slightly recessed into the clear plastic back. Instead of a traditional speaker grill, you get a single slit that is located at the bottom of the back., The design makes for a nice change from the cookie cutter designs that we are seeing on the Redmi Note 3, K6 Note, Meizu M3S, and so forth. The bezels above and below the display also feature a dotted pattern, which adds to its uniqueness. The phone also feels pretty well built. That being said, the device doesn’t look or feel as premium as its metal-bodied competitors. , , Display and UI, The Note 3S comes with a 5.5-inch 720p display, which is a bit surprising considering that the Coolpad Note 3 Plus offered a Full HD display. The screen is slightly warm with a slight colour shift when viewing from angles. Black levels are just about acceptable, but colours are still . It is also pretty bright with a luminance rating of 533 Lux., There is a thick bezel that goes around the display, which doesn’t look very nice. While, the device has pretty decent brightness, the screen is pretty glossy and reflective, making it hard to see in bright sunlight. It should also be noted that the Coolpad Note 3s doesn’t register more than five touches at a time, but that should not be too much of an issue in everyday use. It just shows that Coolpad is using a lower grade display panel., , Coolpad has also introduced a more stock like version of its CoolUI. So you get an app drawer and very little bloatware. However, Coolpad may require more time to polish the new UI. For starters, there is no ‘Clear All’ button in the recent apps list, which can be irritating if, like me, you have a habit of clearing all the recent apps., This wasn’t all.  About two days into using the phone, after an update to Cool UI I started getting a notification that stated, “Unfortunately, Google Play Store has stopped.” It didn’t allow me to use the Play Store and used also used to pop-up when I opened apps. The usually techniques of clearing cache, manually syncing accounts, or even reverting back to an older version of the Play Store didn’t work. I tried wiping cache from the recovery settings, but that didn't solve the issue either. However, neither me, nor my colleagues could get the device to boot in recovery mode. The only way I could fix the problem, was via a factory reset., , Performance, The Note 3S is powered by a 1.36GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 415 octa-core processor with 3GB of RAM. There are very noticeable lags in Asphalt 8's menus, while loading times for heavy games is high as well. Gameplay remains satisfactory, at near 30fps frame rates for the most part. Framing issues are really slight. Not enough to really be an issue, but the phone is evidently slower than competitors for both regular usage, or gaming., , , , , Another issue with the phone was with the accelerometer, which wasn't calibrated properly. We thought this was a limited to our unit only, but the Coolpad Mega 3, which is also being reviewed right now, had the same troubles. When playing games like Asphalt 8, my car veered towards the right of the screen. So, games like Traffic Rider and the aforementioned Asphalt 8 are almost impossible to play. We tried using calibrating apps, which made the issue worse. We then contacted Coolpad about this and the company suggested that we recalibrate the sensor by using a secret code (USSD Codes). After doing so, the games run fine. This may be a result of poor testing procedures for retail units. Further, while we had the option to contact the company, most regular users would take such an issue as a defect in their device., , Camera, The Coolpad Note 3S comes with a 13MP primary camera and images taken are pretty underwhelming. Photos are under saturated and subjects appear soft. There is also highlight clipping when there is strong sunlight falling on an object. Night time makes things worse and there is lots of noise on images, with colour morphing. Further, the app also seems sluggish when shooting in low light, making things tougher. Images taken by the 5MP front facing camera feature a lot of noise, but are just about fine for social media., ,  ,  , Battery, The device comes with a 2500mAh battery, which is much smaller than what you find on the Redmi 3S Prime or the K6 Power. This shows in day-to-day usage. In about an hour and a half, which included about 20-25 minutes of gaming, while the rest was web browsing/social media, the battery dropped from 100% to 75% (100% brightness). You won't really get a full day's battery from the Note 3s, unless you're judicious with your usage. In our synthetic benchmark tests, the device got a score of 4 hours and 37 minutes., Bottom Line, There is very little reason to recommend the Coolpad Note 3S. Besides offering a decent build and display, the device is trumped in almost all aspects by its main competitors, like the Redmi 3S Prime and the Lenovo K6 Power, which offer more for about the same price. Further, issues like the accelerometer calibration problem mentioned above, put us off a little more."

The Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 and the LeEco Le 2 are faster smartphones, and even the Redmi 3S Prime offers better battery life., , The budget smartphone market is arguably the most competitive, with each manufacturer trying to better the other. With the Note 5, Coolpad is continuing the strategy it adopted with the Note 3 — offer the most amount of RAM for the least possible price. With 4GB of RAM, the device is offering more memory than any of its competitors. But is that enough to make it the ideal buy in this price range? Let’s find out. , Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Build and Design, While the Coolpad Note 5 may not be striking to look at, I wouldn’t call it a bad looking phone. Like many other devices at this price range, the Coolpad Note 5 offers a metal body design. At the front you get a 5.5-inch display, with 2.5D glass. Below it are the non-backlit capacitive buttons, while on top is the earpiece, front-facing flash and camera, as well as the sensors. You also get slightly chamfered edges around the sides, along with a 3.5mm headphone jack and a micro USB slot. The power button is on the right, while the volume rocker is on the left. , , Turn the phone around, and you get an immediate sense of deja-vu. The back is basically the same as the Redmi Note 3. The camera, fingerprint sensor and speakers are placed at the same spots. You even get a small ridge below the speaker grille, just like the one you can find on the Redmi Note 3. , 
Coolpad Note 5 (Left) vs Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (Right), Also, the Coolpad Note 5 also does not feel as well built as it's peers. You can feel the edges where the rear panel is fused onto the main body. It's one of those things that you don’t notice initially, but when you do, it's hard to 'un-notice’ it., , Display and UI, The Coolpad Note 5 comes with a 5.5-inch Full-HD display, with a resolution of 1080 x 1920 pixels. The colours and black levels are satisfactory, with a luminance rating of 520 Lux. The viewing angles aren't the best, though, and you see a colour shift from the slightest angles., There is also a very noticeable bezel going around the edge of the display, which doesn't look very nice. Most importantly, though, the touch response wasn't very good and the phone seems to have trouble registering more than 2-3 touches at a time. That's not good for a 'multi-touch' display., , The Coolpad Note 5 comes with its own CoolUI 8.0, which is based on Android Marshmallow. Like most Chinese manufacturers, you don't get an app drawer. Also, unlike UIs based on Android, swiping from the top only shows you notifications. The Quick Toggles are accessed separately by swiping from the bottom. However, whenever I tried to bring up the toggles, I usually ended up accidently pressing one of the capacitive buttons. Personally speaking, I would have liked it if Coolpad had kept the toggles within the Notification drop-down. There is also a search feature, similar to Apple’s Spotlight Search, and it can be accessed by swiping down on the screen., Performance, The highlight of the phone is the fact that it comes with 4GB of RAM, making it one of the cheapest devices to offer that amount of memory. However, it doesn’t seem to utilise the extra RAM to its fullest. There are occasional lags and stutters that I came across while using the device. In benchmark tests, the Coolpad Note 5 scores almost the same as the Moto G4 Plus, which has the same Snapdragon 617 SoC, but half the amount of RAM. I suspect that the difference in performance may be because Moto has a better a leaner interface running on its phone, than CoolUI. , , , , , While the Coolpad Note 5 can run high-end games like Asphalt 8 and Injustice: Gods Among Us, there are slight frame drops while playing both. However, there isn’t much of a heating issue. During our tests, the phone rarely got hotter than 37 degrees, while playing games., Call quality on the Coolpad Note 5 is good and works just fine. However, it should be noted that the phone does not support 5GHz Wi-Fi bands. This shouldn't be a big issue at the moment, though., Camera, The Coolpad Note 5 comes with a 13MP rear camera with a f/2.2 aperture lens. The camera app features Night Mode, HDR, Beauty mode as well as a Pro mode. It also supports video recording up to 1080p., 
The Coolpad Note 5 has a 13MP rear camera, The images taken by the Coolpad Note 5 lack detail with higher image noise as compared to its competitors. Colors are also desaturated, although photos are bright. The camera struggles with colour representation at times. It takes the dominant colours in the frame, and tends to create a hue of it on the picture. In low light, images have higher noise and very low detail. While Night mode produces brighter photos, details are still lower. , , At the front is an 8MP camera with LED flash. Like the rear camera, selfies lack detail and are desaturated. While the phone does come with a front facing flash, it is a static LED in lamp mode. So, when you turn the flash on, it lights up and stays that way. It essentially acts like a bulb, flushing you face with light, rather than a flash that comes on when needed. This makes clicking selfies with the flash quite difficult as you have to stare into the light in order to take pictures., Battery, The Coolpad Note 5 is equipped with a large 4010 mAh battery, which I feel is the best aspect of the device. The phone was easily able to last through an average work day. I watch one and a half hours of continuous video on my phone, every day, and yet the phone had enough juice to last the rest of the day. The battery drops from 100% to 85% in about an hour and a half, but the drop becomes slower since then. On days when I played no games, or watched no videos, I would reach home around 11pm, with 50% battery still left on the phone. This, ideally means most regular users can get up to two-days worth of battery life from the Coolpad Note 5, with some judicial usage. , Bottomline, While the Coolpad Note 5 may have more RAM than its peers, it does seem to utilise it properly. In performance, it is soundly beaten by the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 and the LeEco Le 2. The best aspect of the phone is its battery life. But even then, the Redmi Note 3 and the Redmi 3S Prime can offer the same battery life. I find it very hard to recommend the Coolpad Note 5 over those other phones because of its sub-par display and comparatively weaker performance."

1795,42,htc-desire-10-pro-review-48696,0,0,2019-05-22,48696,Prasid Banerjee,HTC Desire 10 Pro Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/htc-desire-10-pro-review-48696.html,"The HTC Desire 10 Pro is a decent smartphone. In fact, it’s one of the better smartphones that HTC has produced recently. But consider it only if the OnePlus 3, Asus Zenfone 3 or the Moto Z Play aren’t within your reach., , Late last year, Taiwanese smartphone maker HTC said it will not be competing against Chinese companies. Instead, the ailing veteran would compete in segments where it is already popular. That means HTC phones will now be seen in the sub-30k and above categories. This is also a stark switch from what HTC said early last year, that it would launch more affordable smartphones, but not compromise the specs. Nevertheless, the HTC Desire 10 Pro is the embodiment of the new strategy HTC is going to follow., Realme 3 Pro Review, Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 Review, Huawei Honor 10 Lite Review, Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, But while it may not take on the popular budget devices, it goes up against the likes of the Asus Zenfone 3, Moto Z Play, Nubia Z11 and the formidable OnePlus 3. It’s a water and dust resistant smartphone, with unique HTC elements to it., , Build and Design, Almost anyone who’s ever bought a smartphone, recognises HTC for its design prowess. The company is legendary for its design and though the Desire 10 Pro doesn’t set new milestones, it continues what HTC has done all along., It has a plastic body, with golden metal accents along the edges, and a nearly rubbery feel. Together, all of that makes for a grippy, yet premium feel, and it’s unique in its own right. You may question the Desire 10 Pro for a lot of things, but looks isn’t one of them., , , However, there are slight aberrations. For example, one wonders whether HTC could have shaved off some inches from the phone’s overall dimensions. The Desire 10 Pro feels big in a world where 5.5 inch devices are routinely getting more compact. The ridged power button is an example of attention to detail, but you will have to shift your grip to reach between this and the volume rocker. Even the rear fingerprint sensor doesn’t fall intuitively below your index finger, thanks to the size. That’s of course relevant to those with small and medium-sized hands., On the back, you’ll find the rather large 20MP camera sensor on the top left. There is a noticeable bump too, but it all fits quite well with the design. Below the sensor are the flash and laser AF system, placed horizontally and side-by-side. Just below this, at the centre is the fingerprint sensor and a big HTC logo rests bang on the center of the back., , , Overall, the HTC Desire 10 Pro looks distinct and unique, but it feels big and unwieldy too. As long as you’re fine with that, this is one of the better and more unique looking smartphones you can buy today., Display, 1080p displays are pretty much the norm nowadays and the Desire 10 Pro is no different. The IPS LCD panel has great viewing angles, but is not glare free. Sunlight visibility is not ideal outdoors, and indoor usage is sometimes marred by glare. However, it’s reasonably viewable on full brightness, both indoors and outdoors. This, though, means you’ll be using more battery most of the times., Further, colours look close to the source, with impressive gamma correction. However, brightness isn’t ideal. The display is dim, with maximum luminance values of 614 Lux, and auto-brightness struggles to keep up with ambient light conditions., Performance, Powering this smartphone is a MediaTek Helio P10 SoC and 4GB RAM. From the first time that we saw this device at launch, this has been a questionable choice for us. Further testing reveals pretty much what we have seen from other P10 powered smartphones., If you’re a gamer, you’ll be disappointed. Scrolling menus on Asphalt 8 is not stutter free and there are visible lags when camera angles switch in the game. Similarly, Injustice: Gods Among Us takes a few extra seconds to load, while in-game stutters are also seen more often than we’d like. The same is showcased by benchmark tests like GFXBench and 3D Mark Unlimited., For regular usage, the Helio P10 does the job, but only just so. For example, the Deezer app takes more time to load on the HTC Desire 10 Pro than it did on the Lenovo P2 or the Asus Zenfone 3 Ultra (running on Snapdragon 625 and 650 SoCs respectively). Similarly, apps that need location access are slower to load, while games that use data services can sometimes be sluggish., The performance can’t be categorised as poor, but it’s not ideal for a phone in this price range either. After all, almost every other smartphone in and around this price can do better than the Helio P10 does on the HTC Desire 10 Pro. It’s also worth noting that the Oppo F1 Plus, which runs the same SoC, was faster and snappier. This could be because the HTC Desire 10 Pro stops four of the eight cores whenever the CPU load falls below 40%., The same is most likely an effort at improving battery life and generating less heat. On gaming tests, the Desire 10 Pro never crossed 37 degrees over 15 minutes of playing Asphalt 8. It can’t shoot 4K videos., Audio Quality, It is worth mentioning at this point that while the HTC Desire 10 Pro does have the Boomsound audio profile, it depends on a mono speaker only. There are no DACs for audio on this one. While the audio still sounds really good, some audiophile enhancements may have gone a long way towards making this phone a better value proposition., As it stands, the HTC Desire 10 Pro is loud enough and audio is clearer than many other smartphones. It doesn’t, however, create its own niche as far as audio quality is concerned. , Camera, The highlight of the Desire 10 Pro is its 20MP camera. HTC has made huge progress with camera quality since the HTC 10 and this is exhibited by the smartphone as well. However, don’t go expecting a HTC 10 level camera here. The Desire 10 Pro has f/2.2 aperture and most likely uses a Toshiba sensor, instead of Sony or Omnivision. It also has Optical Image Stabilisation. The sensor quality is a major weakness for the camera here., , In practice, image quality is decent, but you can get better. The Desire 10 Pro produces slightly oversaturated images, with good sharpness. It generates quite a bit of noise under low light, and softens images, while also morphing colours. The white balance is often off, irrespective of light conditions. Photos look good enough for sharing on social media, and they look good on the phone’s own display, but that’s about the extent of it., The camera’s biggest weakness, though is in focusing speeds and app launch times. The camera app takes a noticeable second to open, while focusing time is simply too long. This increases even more when focusing in low light, or using the Pro Mode. It’s a real problem when you need to shoot precise moments, or have moving subjects. Another confounding aspect of the camera is that despite having a laser AF system, it often fails to focus when taking macro shots. The focal length seems to be a hurdle here., Overall, the HTC Desire 10 Pro’s camera can be considered decent, but with a weakness that is almost unheard of in smartphones today. The OnePlus 3, Asus Zenfone 3 and Nubia Z11 are all better than this one., The front camera on the HTC Desire 10 Pro is a 13MP unit. It has a wide angle mode, called Selfie Panorama, which takes a fish-eye like panoramic selfie when you need it. What we like about the front camera is the fact that it keeps photos reasonably close to source, instead of softening them, as most phones do. This is a major difference between the Desire 10 Pro and the Oppo F1 Plus., Battery, All of the above is driven by a 3000 mAh battery, which lasts just about 8 hours on regular usage. That’s not ideal battery life in our books, but it’s pretty much the industry average. With 5-7 phone calls, lots of IMs, some social networking and about half an hour of gaming, the Desire 10 Pro got us through a full work day. If you leave home with 100% battery life, you can even try and get to bedtime without having to charge it., While battery life isn’t really a problem with the Desire 10 Pro, charging times are. The phone takes about an hour and a half to charge from 0 to 100%, which is poor in today’s market. Charging for half an hour takes it to a mere 35%, which again is nothing compared to a OnePlus 3 or Moto Z Play., Bottomline, The HTC Desire 10 Pro is a decent smartphone. In fact, it is one of the better smartphones that HTC has produced in the recent past. However, it doesn’t really keep up with the competition. It has a good camera, decent battery life and display, and really good looks, which means you can still consider it. But, buy it only if the OnePlus 3T, Moto Z Play or Asus Zenfone 3 are not within your reach or fancy."
2457,42,huawei-honor-10-lite-review-173343,0,0,2019-05-22,173343,Subhrojit Mallick,Huawei Honor 10 Lite Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/huawei-honor-10-lite-review-173343.html,"The Honor 10 Lite may have come out earlier in China, but for India, it comes just on time. With Mobile World Congress just a month away, the Honor 10 Lite is filling a critical gap in time before more innovative devices come to market. Mid-range phones have performed impressively over the past year and are set to become even more powerful in 2019. While this smartphone does come with the performance expected from a 2019 mid-range phone, there are certain elements that should have been left behind in the past year itself, such as the microUSB port and the inability to stream videos in HD from Netflix or Prime Videos. However, with an almost borderless screen and above average cameras, it’s easy to recommend the Honor 10 Lite. If you need a phone right now, between the Realme 2 Pro, Mi A2, Redmi Note 6 Pro and the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, the Honor 10 Lite is definitely the one to go for. However, in the next few months post MWC, we do expect more exciting mid-range smartphones to be available, so if you can wait, you may better choices a few months down the line., , After launching a series of smartphones ranging from the high-end to entry-level price range, Honor has more or less consolidated its lineup in 2018. The blitzkreig also proved to be profitable for the company as it broke into the top 5 smartphone manufacturers in India according to reports. It’s only obvious that the Huawei sub-brand is now looking to maintain the momentum it gathered last year. The Honor 10 Lite is a way to keep that momentum alive. With a large display, a new processor and a colourful finish, the Honor 10 Lite looks to emulate the success the Honor 9 Lite received at the beginning of 2018. However, because of the mid-range elements in the phone, the phone is priced much higher than its predecessor going all the way up to Rs 17,999. One might argue that the average selling price in the Indian smartphone market has also increased (thanks mostly to the success of high-end devices like OnePlus 6), and as such, the price is more or less acceptable, but with Rs 17,999 to spare, is the Honor 10 Lite the best phone to buy right now? Let’s find out., Huawei Honor 8C 64GB Review, Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, , The Honor 10 Lite looks much like other Honor phones. It has a similar colour treatment with a glossy, reflective exterior. Only, instead of the usual glass panel on the back, the chassis is made out of hard plastic. The company promises high durability, but I wasn’t convinced. Just like the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, it gets scratched easily. It also tends to retain more smudges and fingerprints. I had to keep a microfibre cloth with me at all times to keep the phone spotless. You do get a TPU case out of the box but using that takes away the charm of the glossy finish., , The phone also curves at the edges making it easy to grip. Honor anyway likes to maintain a slim profile and the Honor 10 Lite is quite slim at 8mm. It’s not as wide as the Honor 8X even though the company relies on the same Chip-On-Flex (COF) technology to keep the size of the bezels at the bare minimum. As a result, Honor was able to achieve an impressive 91 percent screen-to-body ratio. With a tiny U-shaped notch housing the front camera, the upper part of the display is also void of much distraction. Between the wide rectangular notch and this one, I prefer the latter simply because it takes up much less space. Since the company did away with a wide notch, all the other elements like the LED notification light and the proximity sensor had to be fitted at the bottom., The biggest quip I have about the Honor 10 Lite is that it still relies on a microUSB port for charging and data transfer. The port is wedged between the 3.5mm headphone jack (thankfully retained) and the speaker grill, and doesn’t support the company’s SuperCharge speeds. I believe it’s now time for the microUSB to retire and make way for USB-C universally., , Nevertheless, the Honor 10 looks good, but I won’t go as far as saying it’s well-built. Plastic isn’t quite durable which is the reason OEMs raced to use aluminium and ceramic and even titanium to make them long-lasting. I would still say it’s better than using glass as it makes the phone less fragile and also allows the space to experiment with various colour treatments. The Honor 10 Lite has a 3D optical effect that takes a lot of effort to accomplish, according to Honor, and while that’s not a new look anymore, it does add a bit of flair to the phone., The display on the Honor 10 Lite is one of the highlights of the phone. The 6.21-inch panel stretches almost all the way to the edges thanks to the CoF technique Honor pulled off. The waterdrop notch on top also allows for more screen real estate. Honor uses a similar LCD panel as the Honor 8X which we had noted to be quite bright. Even the Honor 10 Lite registered high brightness values in our luminescence tests. As such, content on the 19.5:9 aspect ratio display looks good particularly thanks to a high 415 ppi pixel density. The icons appear quite sharp and bright wallpapers appear rich and vibrant. However, the phone lacks the Widevine L1 certification, so even if the display makes HD content appear rich and colourful, you won’t get the same quality while streaming on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and the likes., , The panel also seems to have its white balance set to a cooler bias rather than the neutral white we normally expect from IPS LCD panels.. The blues and greens appear more saturated while the reds and yellows seem a little washed out. The display is especially good for gaming though. The borderless panel immerses you in the game and the extra real estate comes handy when you have large hands., , While it’s nice to have a bright and vibrant display and a cool design, the performance will always be the most essential aspect of a smartphone. If it fails to perform, everything else becomes secondary, and the Honor 10 Lite doesn’t quite disappoint. It relies on the HiSilicon Kirin 710, the same chipset that power the Honor 8X. For anyone wondering, the Honor 8X was the runner-up in the mid-range segment in our Zero1 awards where only the performance matters. The Kirin 710 is based on a 12nm manufacturing process and features four high-performance Cortex A73 cores clocked at 2.2GHz and four high-efficiency Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. While ARM has released new core architectures, the older Cortex A73 cores work quite well. In fact, as compared to the older Kirin 659 where all the eight cores were high-efficiency Cortex A53, the Kirin 710 is quite a performance jump. It reflects in the benchmark results as well. In fact, the Kirin 710 managed to trump Qualcomm’s best mid-range chip in that price range — The Snapdragon 660., , , On AnTuTu, the Honor 10 Lite scored 130849, which is similar to the Honor 8X’s 139785 and more than the Mi A2’s 128895. While on Geekbench Single and Multi core tests, the Kirin 710 showed promise by scoring 1541 and 5427 respectively. In comparison, the Honor 8X also scored similarly with 1602 and 5435 respectively while the Mi A2 scored higher in single core performance at 1602 and more or less the same in the multi-core test at 1632. While Geekbench and AnTuTu measures how well the CPU holds up, 3DMark’s Slingshot measures graphics processing and that’s where the Honor 10 Lite seems to be a little weak. It scored a measly 731 while the Mi A2 outperformed by scoring 1767. Even the Honor 8X had the same weakness, and that’s particularly because the Kirin 710 is paired with an older Mali-G51 GPU  and is no match for the Adreno GPUs., , Nevertheless, Honor compensates for that with the software-based GPU Turbo 2.0. It uses machine learning to render only parts of the frame that change over time, and as such cuts down on the processing power required. The impact is big while playing certain games like PubG Mobile. Gamebench revealed that the popular battle royale game (PubG) ran at 30 FPS while the same game on the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 ran at 26 FPS. Both are much lower than what the high-end smartphones deliver, but that’s as far as you can go with a mid-ranger it seems. GPU Turbo also supports Asphalt 9 and other popular Chinese games., , The Honor 10 Lite runs on Android 9 Pie and is the first Honor phone to come with the latest version out of the box. The new EMUI 9, based on the latest version of Android, brings new features like gesture-based navigation, digital well-being and more. The gestures are very iPhone-like, and takes a little time to get used to. You do get a little extra screen space by removing the navigation buttons. I was more interested in the Digital Balance feature which gave me a quick rundown of where my time went while on the phone. You can also set a stipulated amount of time to use the phone, and is especially useful if you’re giving a phone to your kid. There’s Huawei’s HiVision too which can be used to recognise dresses and famous objects. It did work in some cases but also failed quite a lot of times. It seems like a work in development, and as such, Honor could have just enabled support for Google Lens. Interestingly, the Honor 10 Lite can also project it’s display wirelessly to any miracast supported device. It’s not exactly a new feature, but you can use the phone as it is, while projecting a video to a screen, like how you would use Chromecast to cast content., Everything said and done, even though the Honor 10 Lite is packed with useful features, the UI itself still has the same unaesthetic feel to it. It’s not as refined and seamless as say, MIUI. It does not have the simplicity of stock Android either. It’s weird to see Honor putting so much effort to make the exterior stand out, but the phone’s software experience still has a long way to go., , Throughout 2018, we saw mid-range smartphone cameras go from strength to strength and posed quite a challenge to their expensive counterparts. The Mi A2, for instance, managed to shoot better low-light photos than a lot of other high-end offerings. Cameras have been improving over time, and that’s evident in the Honor 10 Lite. The 13+2MP setup on the Honor 10 Lite is above average. There are obvious compromises like lack of OIS or EIS, although Honor offers it’s AI-based stabilisation in the night mode which is a hit or miss., On the front is a 24MP Sony IMX 576 sensor, the same as the one on the Realme U1. The 24MP sensor bins four pixels into one to generate a better low-light selfie with more details and less noise. Part of that claim is true, but some of it isn’t quite so., Honor also implemented it’s AI-based scene recognition system that comes into play when you are taking a photo of a common scene. The camera can recognise 22 different scenes, and in most cases, it simply boosts up the local contrast and the saturation to bring out a result that the average smartphone user will find attractive., , , , The phone manages to take good photos without much effort when there’s ample sunlight. The dynamic range in the final JPEGs is a little less as the shadows retain lesser details. We have seen mid-rangers like the Mi A2 and the Redmi Note 6 Pro take photos with good details in the shadow regions. However, the photos Honor takes are aesthetically pleasing simply because it jacks up the saturation and contrast in the photos., , , The camera is especially useful in taking closeup shots of food, flowers and the likes. There, the 13MP sensor with its f/1.8 aperture is able to reproduce finer details and the results look good on a big screen. However, since there is no stabilisation in place, you need to have steady hands to click a photo of say, a flower moving in the wind. You can turn the AI off if you don’t want an oversaturated result.,  , Indoors, the camera’s somewhat low dynamic range starts becoming more evident. It tends to shoot at slower shutter speeds and because of a lack of stabilisation, even a slow shutter speed of 1/100s shows signs of blurring in the edges. In case of the sample below, the area farthest in the frame is hardly in focus and lacks sharpness. In the next sample below, the dark area have little to no detail. You can experiment with the focus point a bit to get your desired exposure, but there’s a limit to it., , The phone is especially adept at taking portrait photos. Sure it won’t have that gradient bokeh effect the new iPhones produces and the blurring is pretty linear. But the edge detection and subject separation is pretty accurate., In low-light, the camera falls flat. Shooting in normal Photo mode results in noisy photos, with little to no sharpness. However, the night mode manages to recover some details. It essentially works on the same principle as the OnePlus 6T’s Nightscape mode where the shutter is open for longer and the resulting shake is countered by taking multiple buffer images and fusing them together. The results aren’t as good as the OnePlus 6T though, but good enough for the price it is offered at. Stationery objects are easier to shoot with this mode, as you have to hold the phone up for longer., , Thanks to the pixel-binning efforts, the selfies from the Honor 10 Lite’s 24MP front camera also come out decently well. Sure Honor boosts up the beautifying effects by default but they can be turned off to get a more realistic portrait of people’s faces. It also seemed to work enough in the dark. Apart from binning the pixels together, it also makes the screen bright to use as a source of light. The resulting photos have the background dark and noisy, but the faces are in focus with adequate sharpness., , The Honor 10 Lite have some traits in common with the Honor 8X - The same chipset and a big display among them, but one place where it crucially deviates is the battery capacity. The 10 Lite packs a smaller 3400mAh battery. The company believes the 12nm chipset will be more power efficient and will compensate for the lower capacity. But that's not totally the case. Especially while gaming, the battery drain is higher than normal. A 30-minute session of PubG Mobile drained the battery from 45 percent to 23 percent. While watching content on Netflix, the drain is more conservative however, perhaps because it's not running at full resolution. On PCMark Work 2.0 though, the phone lasted 5 hours 24 minutes, indicating you won't have to plug the phone in charge before evening. The phone also doesn't seem to support any sort of fast charging and topping the battery takes around 1.5 hours. Clearly this isn't the mid-ranger to buy if you're looking for a really long battery life., The Honor 10 Lite may have come out earlier in China, but for India, it comes just on time. With Mobile World Congress just a month away, the Honor 10 Lite is filling a critical gap in time before more innovative devices come to market. Mid-range phones have performed impressively over the past year and are set to become even more powerful in 2019. While this smartphone does come with the performance expected from a 2019 mid-range phone, there are certain elements that should have been left behind in the past year itself, such as the microUSB port and the inability to stream videos in HD from Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. However, with an almost borderless screen and above average cameras, it’s easy to recommend the Honor 10 Lite. If you need a phone right now, between the Realme 2 Pro, Mi A2, Redmi Note 6 Pro and the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, the Honor 10 Lite is definitely the one to go for. However, in the next few months post MWC, we do expect more exciting mid-range smartphones to be available, so if you can wait, you may better choices a few months down the line."

However, in the next few months post MWC, we do expect more exciting mid-range smartphones to be available, so if you can wait, you may better choices a few months down the line., , After launching a series of smartphones ranging from the high-end to entry-level price range, Honor has more or less consolidated its lineup in 2018. The blitzkreig also proved to be profitable for the company as it broke into the top 5 smartphone manufacturers in India according to reports. It’s only obvious that the Huawei sub-brand is now looking to maintain the momentum it gathered last year. The Honor 10 Lite is a way to keep that momentum alive. With a large display, a new processor and a colourful finish, the Honor 10 Lite looks to emulate the success the Honor 9 Lite received at the beginning of 2018. However, because of the mid-range elements in the phone, the phone is priced much higher than its predecessor going all the way up to Rs 17,999. One might argue that the average selling price in the Indian smartphone market has also increased (thanks mostly to the success of high-end devices like OnePlus 6), and as such, the price is more or less acceptable, but with Rs 17,999 to spare, is the Honor 10 Lite the best phone to buy right now? Let’s find out., Huawei Honor 8C 64GB Review, Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, , The Honor 10 Lite looks much like other Honor phones. It has a similar colour treatment with a glossy, reflective exterior. Only, instead of the usual glass panel on the back, the chassis is made out of hard plastic. The company promises high durability, but I wasn’t convinced. Just like the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, it gets scratched easily. It also tends to retain more smudges and fingerprints. I had to keep a microfibre cloth with me at all times to keep the phone spotless. You do get a TPU case out of the box but using that takes away the charm of the glossy finish., , The phone also curves at the edges making it easy to grip. Honor anyway likes to maintain a slim profile and the Honor 10 Lite is quite slim at 8mm. It’s not as wide as the Honor 8X even though the company relies on the same Chip-On-Flex (COF) technology to keep the size of the bezels at the bare minimum. As a result, Honor was able to achieve an impressive 91 percent screen-to-body ratio. With a tiny U-shaped notch housing the front camera, the upper part of the display is also void of much distraction. Between the wide rectangular notch and this one, I prefer the latter simply because it takes up much less space. Since the company did away with a wide notch, all the other elements like the LED notification light and the proximity sensor had to be fitted at the bottom., The biggest quip I have about the Honor 10 Lite is that it still relies on a microUSB port for charging and data transfer. The port is wedged between the 3.5mm headphone jack (thankfully retained) and the speaker grill, and doesn’t support the company’s SuperCharge speeds. I believe it’s now time for the microUSB to retire and make way for USB-C universally., , Nevertheless, the Honor 10 looks good, but I won’t go as far as saying it’s well-built. Plastic isn’t quite durable which is the reason OEMs raced to use aluminium and ceramic and even titanium to make them long-lasting. I would still say it’s better than using glass as it makes the phone less fragile and also allows the space to experiment with various colour treatments.

Honor uses a similar LCD panel as the Honor 8X which we had noted to be quite bright. Even the Honor 10 Lite registered high brightness values in our luminescence tests. As such, content on the 19.5:9 aspect ratio display looks good particularly thanks to a high 415 ppi pixel density. The icons appear quite sharp and bright wallpapers appear rich and vibrant. However, the phone lacks the Widevine L1 certification, so even if the display makes HD content appear rich and colourful, you won’t get the same quality while streaming on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and the likes., , The panel also seems to have its white balance set to a cooler bias rather than the neutral white we normally expect from IPS LCD panels.. The blues and greens appear more saturated while the reds and yellows seem a little washed out. The display is especially good for gaming though. The borderless panel immerses you in the game and the extra real estate comes handy when you have large hands., , While it’s nice to have a bright and vibrant display and a cool design, the performance will always be the most essential aspect of a smartphone. If it fails to perform, everything else becomes secondary, and the Honor 10 Lite doesn’t quite disappoint. It relies on the HiSilicon Kirin 710, the same chipset that power the Honor 8X. For anyone wondering, the Honor 8X was the runner-up in the mid-range segment in our Zero1 awards where only the performance matters. The Kirin 710 is based on a 12nm manufacturing process and features four high-performance Cortex A73 cores clocked at 2.2GHz and four high-efficiency Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. While ARM has released new core architectures, the older Cortex A73 cores work quite well. In fact, as compared to the older Kirin 659 where all the eight cores were high-efficiency Cortex A53, the Kirin 710 is quite a performance jump. It reflects in the benchmark results as well. In fact, the Kirin 710 managed to trump Qualcomm’s best mid-range chip in that price range — The Snapdragon 660., , , On AnTuTu, the Honor 10 Lite scored 130849, which is similar to the Honor 8X’s 139785 and more than the Mi A2’s 128895. While on Geekbench Single and Multi core tests, the Kirin 710 showed promise by scoring 1541 and 5427 respectively. In comparison, the Honor 8X also scored similarly with 1602 and 5435 respectively while the Mi A2 scored higher in single core performance at 1602 and more or less the same in the multi-core test at 1632. While Geekbench and AnTuTu measures how well the CPU holds up, 3DMark’s Slingshot measures graphics processing and that’s where the Honor 10 Lite seems to be a little weak. It scored a measly 731 while the Mi A2 outperformed by scoring 1767. Even the Honor 8X had the same weakness, and that’s particularly because the Kirin 710 is paired with an older Mali-G51 GPU  and is no match for the Adreno GPUs., , Nevertheless, Honor compensates for that with the software-based GPU Turbo 2.0. It uses machine learning to render only parts of the frame that change over time, and as such cuts down on the processing power required. The impact is big while playing certain games like PubG Mobile. Gamebench revealed that the popular battle royale game (PubG) ran at 30 FPS while the same game on the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 ran at 26 FPS. Both are much lower than what the high-end smartphones deliver, but that’s as far as you can go with a mid-ranger it seems. GPU Turbo also supports Asphalt 9 and other popular Chinese games., , The Honor 10 Lite runs on Android 9 Pie and is the first Honor phone to come with the latest version out of the box. The new EMUI 9, based on the latest version of Android, brings new features like gesture-based navigation, digital well-being and more. The gestures are very iPhone-like, and takes a little time to get used to. You do get a little extra screen space by removing the navigation buttons. I was more interested in the Digital Balance feature which gave me a quick rundown of where my time went while on the phone. You can also set a stipulated amount of time to use the phone, and is especially useful if you’re giving a phone to your kid. There’s Huawei’s HiVision too which can be used to recognise dresses and famous objects. It did work in some cases but also failed quite a lot of times. It seems like a work in development, and as such, Honor could have just enabled support for Google Lens. Interestingly, the Honor 10 Lite can also project it’s display wirelessly to any miracast supported device. It’s not exactly a new feature, but you can use the phone as it is, while projecting a video to a screen, like how you would use Chromecast to cast content., Everything said and done, even though the Honor 10 Lite is packed with useful features, the UI itself still has the same unaesthetic feel to it. It’s not as refined and seamless as say, MIUI. It does not have the simplicity of stock Android either. It’s weird to see Honor putting so much effort to make the exterior stand out, but the phone’s software experience still has a long way to go., , Throughout 2018, we saw mid-range smartphone cameras go from strength to strength and posed quite a challenge to their expensive counterparts. The Mi A2, for instance, managed to shoot better low-light photos than a lot of other high-end offerings. Cameras have been improving over time, and that’s evident in the Honor 10 Lite. The 13+2MP setup on the Honor 10 Lite is above average. There are obvious compromises like lack of OIS or EIS, although Honor offers it’s AI-based stabilisation in the night mode which is a hit or miss., On the front is a 24MP Sony IMX 576 sensor, the same as the one on the Realme U1. The 24MP sensor bins four pixels into one to generate a better low-light selfie with more details and less noise. Part of that claim is true, but some of it isn’t quite so., Honor also implemented it’s AI-based scene recognition system that comes into play when you are taking a photo of a common scene. The camera can recognise 22 different scenes, and in most cases, it simply boosts up the local contrast and the saturation to bring out a result that the average smartphone user will find attractive., , , , The phone manages to take good photos without much effort when there’s ample sunlight. The dynamic range in the final JPEGs is a little less as the shadows retain lesser details. We have seen mid-rangers like the Mi A2 and the Redmi Note 6 Pro take photos with good details in the shadow regions. However, the photos Honor takes are aesthetically pleasing simply because it jacks up the saturation and contrast in the photos., , , The camera is especially useful in taking closeup shots of food, flowers and the likes. There, the 13MP sensor with its f/1.8 aperture is able to reproduce finer details and the results look good on a big screen. However, since there is no stabilisation in place, you need to have steady hands to click a photo of say, a flower moving in the wind. You can turn the AI off if you don’t want an oversaturated result.,  , Indoors, the camera’s somewhat low dynamic range starts becoming more evident. It tends to shoot at slower shutter speeds and because of a lack of stabilisation, even a slow shutter speed of 1/100s shows signs of blurring in the edges. In case of the sample below, the area farthest in the frame is hardly in focus and lacks sharpness. In the next sample below, the dark area have little to no detail. You can experiment with the focus point a bit to get your desired exposure, but there’s a limit to it., , The phone is especially adept at taking portrait photos. Sure it won’t have that gradient bokeh effect the new iPhones produces and the blurring is pretty linear. But the edge detection and subject separation is pretty accurate., In low-light, the camera falls flat. Shooting in normal Photo mode results in noisy photos, with little to no sharpness. However, the night mode manages to recover some details. It essentially works on the same principle as the OnePlus 6T’s Nightscape mode where the shutter is open for longer and the resulting shake is countered by taking multiple buffer images and fusing them together. The results aren’t as good as the OnePlus 6T though, but good enough for the price it is offered at. Stationery objects are easier to shoot with this mode, as you have to hold the phone up for longer., , Thanks to the pixel-binning efforts, the selfies from the Honor 10 Lite’s 24MP front camera also come out decently well. Sure Honor boosts up the beautifying effects by default but they can be turned off to get a more realistic portrait of people’s faces. It also seemed to work enough in the dark. Apart from binning the pixels together, it also makes the screen bright to use as a source of light. The resulting photos have the background dark and noisy, but the faces are in focus with adequate sharpness., , The Honor 10 Lite have some traits in common with the Honor 8X - The same chipset and a big display among them, but one place where it crucially deviates is the battery capacity. The 10 Lite packs a smaller 3400mAh battery. The company believes the 12nm chipset will be more power efficient and will compensate for the lower capacity. But that's not totally the case. Especially while gaming, the battery drain is higher than normal. A 30-minute session of PubG Mobile drained the battery from 45 percent to 23 percent. While watching content on Netflix, the drain is more conservative however, perhaps because it's not running at full resolution. On PCMark Work 2.0 though, the phone lasted 5 hours 24 minutes, indicating you won't have to plug the phone in charge before evening. The phone also doesn't seem to support any sort of fast charging and topping the battery takes around 1.5 hours. Clearly this isn't the mid-ranger to buy if you're looking for a really long battery life., The Honor 10 Lite may have come out earlier in China, but for India, it comes just on time. With Mobile World Congress just a month away, the Honor 10 Lite is filling a critical gap in time before more innovative devices come to market. Mid-range phones have performed impressively over the past year and are set to become even more powerful in 2019. While this smartphone does come with the performance expected from a 2019 mid-range phone, there are certain elements that should have been left behind in the past year itself, such as the microUSB port and the inability to stream videos in HD from Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. However, with an almost borderless screen and above average cameras, it’s easy to recommend the Honor 10 Lite. If you need a phone right now, between the Realme 2 Pro, Mi A2, Redmi Note 6 Pro and the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, the Honor 10 Lite is definitely the one to go for. However, in the next few months post MWC, we do expect more exciting mid-range smartphones to be available, so if you can wait, you may better choices a few months down the line."

However, in the next few months post MWC, we do expect more exciting mid-range smartphones to be available, so if you can wait, you may better choices a few months down the line., , After launching a series of smartphones ranging from the high-end to entry-level price range, Honor has more or less consolidated its lineup in 2018. The blitzkreig also proved to be profitable for the company as it broke into the top 5 smartphone manufacturers in India according to reports. It’s only obvious that the Huawei sub-brand is now looking to maintain the momentum it gathered last year. The Honor 10 Lite is a way to keep that momentum alive. With a large display, a new processor and a colourful finish, the Honor 10 Lite looks to emulate the success the Honor 9 Lite received at the beginning of 2018. However, because of the mid-range elements in the phone, the phone is priced much higher than its predecessor going all the way up to Rs 17,999. One might argue that the average selling price in the Indian smartphone market has also increased (thanks mostly to the success of high-end devices like OnePlus 6), and as such, the price is more or less acceptable, but with Rs 17,999 to spare, is the Honor 10 Lite the best phone to buy right now? Let’s find out., Huawei Honor 8C 64GB Review, Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, , The Honor 10 Lite looks much like other Honor phones. It has a similar colour treatment with a glossy, reflective exterior. Only, instead of the usual glass panel on the back, the chassis is made out of hard plastic. The company promises high durability, but I wasn’t convinced. Just like the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, it gets scratched easily. It also tends to retain more smudges and fingerprints. I had to keep a microfibre cloth with me at all times to keep the phone spotless. You do get a TPU case out of the box but using that takes away the charm of the glossy finish., , The phone also curves at the edges making it easy to grip. Honor anyway likes to maintain a slim profile and the Honor 10 Lite is quite slim at 8mm. It’s not as wide as the Honor 8X even though the company relies on the same Chip-On-Flex (COF) technology to keep the size of the bezels at the bare minimum. As a result, Honor was able to achieve an impressive 91 percent screen-to-body ratio. With a tiny U-shaped notch housing the front camera, the upper part of the display is also void of much distraction. Between the wide rectangular notch and this one, I prefer the latter simply because it takes up much less space. Since the company did away with a wide notch, all the other elements like the LED notification light and the proximity sensor had to be fitted at the bottom., The biggest quip I have about the Honor 10 Lite is that it still relies on a microUSB port for charging and data transfer. The port is wedged between the 3.5mm headphone jack (thankfully retained) and the speaker grill, and doesn’t support the company’s SuperCharge speeds. I believe it’s now time for the microUSB to retire and make way for USB-C universally., , Nevertheless, the Honor 10 looks good, but I won’t go as far as saying it’s well-built. Plastic isn’t quite durable which is the reason OEMs raced to use aluminium and ceramic and even titanium to make them long-lasting. I would still say it’s better than using glass as it makes the phone less fragile and also allows the space to experiment with various colour treatments. The Honor 10 Lite has a 3D optical effect that takes a lot of effort to accomplish, according to Honor, and while that’s not a new look anymore, it does add a bit of flair to the phone., The display on the Honor 10 Lite is one of the highlights of the phone.

As such, content on the 19.5:9 aspect ratio display looks good particularly thanks to a high 415 ppi pixel density. The icons appear quite sharp and bright wallpapers appear rich and vibrant. However, the phone lacks the Widevine L1 certification, so even if the display makes HD content appear rich and colourful, you won’t get the same quality while streaming on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and the likes., , The panel also seems to have its white balance set to a cooler bias rather than the neutral white we normally expect from IPS LCD panels.. The blues and greens appear more saturated while the reds and yellows seem a little washed out. The display is especially good for gaming though. The borderless panel immerses you in the game and the extra real estate comes handy when you have large hands., , While it’s nice to have a bright and vibrant display and a cool design, the performance will always be the most essential aspect of a smartphone. If it fails to perform, everything else becomes secondary, and the Honor 10 Lite doesn’t quite disappoint. It relies on the HiSilicon Kirin 710, the same chipset that power the Honor 8X. For anyone wondering, the Honor 8X was the runner-up in the mid-range segment in our Zero1 awards where only the performance matters. The Kirin 710 is based on a 12nm manufacturing process and features four high-performance Cortex A73 cores clocked at 2.2GHz and four high-efficiency Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. While ARM has released new core architectures, the older Cortex A73 cores work quite well. In fact, as compared to the older Kirin 659 where all the eight cores were high-efficiency Cortex A53, the Kirin 710 is quite a performance jump. It reflects in the benchmark results as well. In fact, the Kirin 710 managed to trump Qualcomm’s best mid-range chip in that price range — The Snapdragon 660., , , On AnTuTu, the Honor 10 Lite scored 130849, which is similar to the Honor 8X’s 139785 and more than the Mi A2’s 128895. While on Geekbench Single and Multi core tests, the Kirin 710 showed promise by scoring 1541 and 5427 respectively. In comparison, the Honor 8X also scored similarly with 1602 and 5435 respectively while the Mi A2 scored higher in single core performance at 1602 and more or less the same in the multi-core test at 1632. While Geekbench and AnTuTu measures how well the CPU holds up, 3DMark’s Slingshot measures graphics processing and that’s where the Honor 10 Lite seems to be a little weak. It scored a measly 731 while the Mi A2 outperformed by scoring 1767. Even the Honor 8X had the same weakness, and that’s particularly because the Kirin 710 is paired with an older Mali-G51 GPU  and is no match for the Adreno GPUs., , Nevertheless, Honor compensates for that with the software-based GPU Turbo 2.0. It uses machine learning to render only parts of the frame that change over time, and as such cuts down on the processing power required. The impact is big while playing certain games like PubG Mobile. Gamebench revealed that the popular battle royale game (PubG) ran at 30 FPS while the same game on the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 ran at 26 FPS. Both are much lower than what the high-end smartphones deliver, but that’s as far as you can go with a mid-ranger it seems. GPU Turbo also supports Asphalt 9 and other popular Chinese games., , The Honor 10 Lite runs on Android 9 Pie and is the first Honor phone to come with the latest version out of the box. The new EMUI 9, based on the latest version of Android, brings new features like gesture-based navigation, digital well-being and more. The gestures are very iPhone-like, and takes a little time to get used to. You do get a little extra screen space by removing the navigation buttons. I was more interested in the Digital Balance feature which gave me a quick rundown of where my time went while on the phone. You can also set a stipulated amount of time to use the phone, and is especially useful if you’re giving a phone to your kid. There’s Huawei’s HiVision too which can be used to recognise dresses and famous objects. It did work in some cases but also failed quite a lot of times. It seems like a work in development, and as such, Honor could have just enabled support for Google Lens. Interestingly, the Honor 10 Lite can also project it’s display wirelessly to any miracast supported device. It’s not exactly a new feature, but you can use the phone as it is, while projecting a video to a screen, like how you would use Chromecast to cast content., Everything said and done, even though the Honor 10 Lite is packed with useful features, the UI itself still has the same unaesthetic feel to it. It’s not as refined and seamless as say, MIUI. It does not have the simplicity of stock Android either. It’s weird to see Honor putting so much effort to make the exterior stand out, but the phone’s software experience still has a long way to go., , Throughout 2018, we saw mid-range smartphone cameras go from strength to strength and posed quite a challenge to their expensive counterparts. The Mi A2, for instance, managed to shoot better low-light photos than a lot of other high-end offerings. Cameras have been improving over time, and that’s evident in the Honor 10 Lite. The 13+2MP setup on the Honor 10 Lite is above average. There are obvious compromises like lack of OIS or EIS, although Honor offers it’s AI-based stabilisation in the night mode which is a hit or miss., On the front is a 24MP Sony IMX 576 sensor, the same as the one on the Realme U1. The 24MP sensor bins four pixels into one to generate a better low-light selfie with more details and less noise. Part of that claim is true, but some of it isn’t quite so., Honor also implemented it’s AI-based scene recognition system that comes into play when you are taking a photo of a common scene. The camera can recognise 22 different scenes, and in most cases, it simply boosts up the local contrast and the saturation to bring out a result that the average smartphone user will find attractive., , , , The phone manages to take good photos without much effort when there’s ample sunlight. The dynamic range in the final JPEGs is a little less as the shadows retain lesser details. We have seen mid-rangers like the Mi A2 and the Redmi Note 6 Pro take photos with good details in the shadow regions. However, the photos Honor takes are aesthetically pleasing simply because it jacks up the saturation and contrast in the photos., , , The camera is especially useful in taking closeup shots of food, flowers and the likes. There, the 13MP sensor with its f/1.8 aperture is able to reproduce finer details and the results look good on a big screen. However, since there is no stabilisation in place, you need to have steady hands to click a photo of say, a flower moving in the wind. You can turn the AI off if you don’t want an oversaturated result.,  , Indoors, the camera’s somewhat low dynamic range starts becoming more evident. It tends to shoot at slower shutter speeds and because of a lack of stabilisation, even a slow shutter speed of 1/100s shows signs of blurring in the edges. In case of the sample below, the area farthest in the frame is hardly in focus and lacks sharpness. In the next sample below, the dark area have little to no detail. You can experiment with the focus point a bit to get your desired exposure, but there’s a limit to it., , The phone is especially adept at taking portrait photos. Sure it won’t have that gradient bokeh effect the new iPhones produces and the blurring is pretty linear. But the edge detection and subject separation is pretty accurate., In low-light, the camera falls flat. Shooting in normal Photo mode results in noisy photos, with little to no sharpness. However, the night mode manages to recover some details. It essentially works on the same principle as the OnePlus 6T’s Nightscape mode where the shutter is open for longer and the resulting shake is countered by taking multiple buffer images and fusing them together. The results aren’t as good as the OnePlus 6T though, but good enough for the price it is offered at. Stationery objects are easier to shoot with this mode, as you have to hold the phone up for longer., , Thanks to the pixel-binning efforts, the selfies from the Honor 10 Lite’s 24MP front camera also come out decently well. Sure Honor boosts up the beautifying effects by default but they can be turned off to get a more realistic portrait of people’s faces. It also seemed to work enough in the dark. Apart from binning the pixels together, it also makes the screen bright to use as a source of light. The resulting photos have the background dark and noisy, but the faces are in focus with adequate sharpness., , The Honor 10 Lite have some traits in common with the Honor 8X - The same chipset and a big display among them, but one place where it crucially deviates is the battery capacity. The 10 Lite packs a smaller 3400mAh battery. The company believes the 12nm chipset will be more power efficient and will compensate for the lower capacity. But that's not totally the case. Especially while gaming, the battery drain is higher than normal. A 30-minute session of PubG Mobile drained the battery from 45 percent to 23 percent. While watching content on Netflix, the drain is more conservative however, perhaps because it's not running at full resolution. On PCMark Work 2.0 though, the phone lasted 5 hours 24 minutes, indicating you won't have to plug the phone in charge before evening. The phone also doesn't seem to support any sort of fast charging and topping the battery takes around 1.5 hours. Clearly this isn't the mid-ranger to buy if you're looking for a really long battery life., The Honor 10 Lite may have come out earlier in China, but for India, it comes just on time. With Mobile World Congress just a month away, the Honor 10 Lite is filling a critical gap in time before more innovative devices come to market. Mid-range phones have performed impressively over the past year and are set to become even more powerful in 2019. While this smartphone does come with the performance expected from a 2019 mid-range phone, there are certain elements that should have been left behind in the past year itself, such as the microUSB port and the inability to stream videos in HD from Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. However, with an almost borderless screen and above average cameras, it’s easy to recommend the Honor 10 Lite. If you need a phone right now, between the Realme 2 Pro, Mi A2, Redmi Note 6 Pro and the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, the Honor 10 Lite is definitely the one to go for. However, in the next few months post MWC, we do expect more exciting mid-range smartphones to be available, so if you can wait, you may better choices a few months down the line."

However, in the next few months post MWC, we do expect more exciting mid-range smartphones to be available, so if you can wait, you may better choices a few months down the line., , After launching a series of smartphones ranging from the high-end to entry-level price range, Honor has more or less consolidated its lineup in 2018. The blitzkreig also proved to be profitable for the company as it broke into the top 5 smartphone manufacturers in India according to reports. It’s only obvious that the Huawei sub-brand is now looking to maintain the momentum it gathered last year. The Honor 10 Lite is a way to keep that momentum alive. With a large display, a new processor and a colourful finish, the Honor 10 Lite looks to emulate the success the Honor 9 Lite received at the beginning of 2018. However, because of the mid-range elements in the phone, the phone is priced much higher than its predecessor going all the way up to Rs 17,999. One might argue that the average selling price in the Indian smartphone market has also increased (thanks mostly to the success of high-end devices like OnePlus 6), and as such, the price is more or less acceptable, but with Rs 17,999 to spare, is the Honor 10 Lite the best phone to buy right now? Let’s find out., Huawei Honor 8C 64GB Review, Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, , The Honor 10 Lite looks much like other Honor phones. It has a similar colour treatment with a glossy, reflective exterior. Only, instead of the usual glass panel on the back, the chassis is made out of hard plastic. The company promises high durability, but I wasn’t convinced. Just like the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, it gets scratched easily. It also tends to retain more smudges and fingerprints. I had to keep a microfibre cloth with me at all times to keep the phone spotless. You do get a TPU case out of the box but using that takes away the charm of the glossy finish., , The phone also curves at the edges making it easy to grip. Honor anyway likes to maintain a slim profile and the Honor 10 Lite is quite slim at 8mm. It’s not as wide as the Honor 8X even though the company relies on the same Chip-On-Flex (COF) technology to keep the size of the bezels at the bare minimum. As a result, Honor was able to achieve an impressive 91 percent screen-to-body ratio. With a tiny U-shaped notch housing the front camera, the upper part of the display is also void of much distraction. Between the wide rectangular notch and this one, I prefer the latter simply because it takes up much less space. Since the company did away with a wide notch, all the other elements like the LED notification light and the proximity sensor had to be fitted at the bottom., The biggest quip I have about the Honor 10 Lite is that it still relies on a microUSB port for charging and data transfer. The port is wedged between the 3.5mm headphone jack (thankfully retained) and the speaker grill, and doesn’t support the company’s SuperCharge speeds. I believe it’s now time for the microUSB to retire and make way for USB-C universally., , Nevertheless, the Honor 10 looks good, but I won’t go as far as saying it’s well-built. Plastic isn’t quite durable which is the reason OEMs raced to use aluminium and ceramic and even titanium to make them long-lasting. I would still say it’s better than using glass as it makes the phone less fragile and also allows the space to experiment with various colour treatments. The Honor 10 Lite has a 3D optical effect that takes a lot of effort to accomplish, according to Honor, and while that’s not a new look anymore, it does add a bit of flair to the phone., The display on the Honor 10 Lite is one of the highlights of the phone.

However, the phone lacks the Widevine L1 certification, so even if the display makes HD content appear rich and colourful, you won’t get the same quality while streaming on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and the likes., , The panel also seems to have its white balance set to a cooler bias rather than the neutral white we normally expect from IPS LCD panels.. The blues and greens appear more saturated while the reds and yellows seem a little washed out. The display is especially good for gaming though. The borderless panel immerses you in the game and the extra real estate comes handy when you have large hands., , While it’s nice to have a bright and vibrant display and a cool design, the performance will always be the most essential aspect of a smartphone. If it fails to perform, everything else becomes secondary, and the Honor 10 Lite doesn’t quite disappoint. It relies on the HiSilicon Kirin 710, the same chipset that power the Honor 8X. For anyone wondering, the Honor 8X was the runner-up in the mid-range segment in our Zero1 awards where only the performance matters. The Kirin 710 is based on a 12nm manufacturing process and features four high-performance Cortex A73 cores clocked at 2.2GHz and four high-efficiency Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. While ARM has released new core architectures, the older Cortex A73 cores work quite well. In fact, as compared to the older Kirin 659 where all the eight cores were high-efficiency Cortex A53, the Kirin 710 is quite a performance jump. It reflects in the benchmark results as well. In fact, the Kirin 710 managed to trump Qualcomm’s best mid-range chip in that price range — The Snapdragon 660., , , On AnTuTu, the Honor 10 Lite scored 130849, which is similar to the Honor 8X’s 139785 and more than the Mi A2’s 128895. While on Geekbench Single and Multi core tests, the Kirin 710 showed promise by scoring 1541 and 5427 respectively. In comparison, the Honor 8X also scored similarly with 1602 and 5435 respectively while the Mi A2 scored higher in single core performance at 1602 and more or less the same in the multi-core test at 1632. While Geekbench and AnTuTu measures how well the CPU holds up, 3DMark’s Slingshot measures graphics processing and that’s where the Honor 10 Lite seems to be a little weak. It scored a measly 731 while the Mi A2 outperformed by scoring 1767. Even the Honor 8X had the same weakness, and that’s particularly because the Kirin 710 is paired with an older Mali-G51 GPU  and is no match for the Adreno GPUs., , Nevertheless, Honor compensates for that with the software-based GPU Turbo 2.0. It uses machine learning to render only parts of the frame that change over time, and as such cuts down on the processing power required. The impact is big while playing certain games like PubG Mobile. Gamebench revealed that the popular battle royale game (PubG) ran at 30 FPS while the same game on the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 ran at 26 FPS. Both are much lower than what the high-end smartphones deliver, but that’s as far as you can go with a mid-ranger it seems. GPU Turbo also supports Asphalt 9 and other popular Chinese games., , The Honor 10 Lite runs on Android 9 Pie and is the first Honor phone to come with the latest version out of the box. The new EMUI 9, based on the latest version of Android, brings new features like gesture-based navigation, digital well-being and more. The gestures are very iPhone-like, and takes a little time to get used to. You do get a little extra screen space by removing the navigation buttons. I was more interested in the Digital Balance feature which gave me a quick rundown of where my time went while on the phone. You can also set a stipulated amount of time to use the phone, and is especially useful if you’re giving a phone to your kid. There’s Huawei’s HiVision too which can be used to recognise dresses and famous objects. It did work in some cases but also failed quite a lot of times. It seems like a work in development, and as such, Honor could have just enabled support for Google Lens. Interestingly, the Honor 10 Lite can also project it’s display wirelessly to any miracast supported device. It’s not exactly a new feature, but you can use the phone as it is, while projecting a video to a screen, like how you would use Chromecast to cast content., Everything said and done, even though the Honor 10 Lite is packed with useful features, the UI itself still has the same unaesthetic feel to it. It’s not as refined and seamless as say, MIUI. It does not have the simplicity of stock Android either. It’s weird to see Honor putting so much effort to make the exterior stand out, but the phone’s software experience still has a long way to go., , Throughout 2018, we saw mid-range smartphone cameras go from strength to strength and posed quite a challenge to their expensive counterparts. The Mi A2, for instance, managed to shoot better low-light photos than a lot of other high-end offerings. Cameras have been improving over time, and that’s evident in the Honor 10 Lite. The 13+2MP setup on the Honor 10 Lite is above average. There are obvious compromises like lack of OIS or EIS, although Honor offers it’s AI-based stabilisation in the night mode which is a hit or miss., On the front is a 24MP Sony IMX 576 sensor, the same as the one on the Realme U1. The 24MP sensor bins four pixels into one to generate a better low-light selfie with more details and less noise. Part of that claim is true, but some of it isn’t quite so., Honor also implemented it’s AI-based scene recognition system that comes into play when you are taking a photo of a common scene. The camera can recognise 22 different scenes, and in most cases, it simply boosts up the local contrast and the saturation to bring out a result that the average smartphone user will find attractive., , , , The phone manages to take good photos without much effort when there’s ample sunlight. The dynamic range in the final JPEGs is a little less as the shadows retain lesser details. We have seen mid-rangers like the Mi A2 and the Redmi Note 6 Pro take photos with good details in the shadow regions. However, the photos Honor takes are aesthetically pleasing simply because it jacks up the saturation and contrast in the photos., , , The camera is especially useful in taking closeup shots of food, flowers and the likes. There, the 13MP sensor with its f/1.8 aperture is able to reproduce finer details and the results look good on a big screen. However, since there is no stabilisation in place, you need to have steady hands to click a photo of say, a flower moving in the wind. You can turn the AI off if you don’t want an oversaturated result.,  , Indoors, the camera’s somewhat low dynamic range starts becoming more evident. It tends to shoot at slower shutter speeds and because of a lack of stabilisation, even a slow shutter speed of 1/100s shows signs of blurring in the edges. In case of the sample below, the area farthest in the frame is hardly in focus and lacks sharpness. In the next sample below, the dark area have little to no detail. You can experiment with the focus point a bit to get your desired exposure, but there’s a limit to it., , The phone is especially adept at taking portrait photos. Sure it won’t have that gradient bokeh effect the new iPhones produces and the blurring is pretty linear. But the edge detection and subject separation is pretty accurate., In low-light, the camera falls flat. Shooting in normal Photo mode results in noisy photos, with little to no sharpness. However, the night mode manages to recover some details. It essentially works on the same principle as the OnePlus 6T’s Nightscape mode where the shutter is open for longer and the resulting shake is countered by taking multiple buffer images and fusing them together. The results aren’t as good as the OnePlus 6T though, but good enough for the price it is offered at. Stationery objects are easier to shoot with this mode, as you have to hold the phone up for longer., , Thanks to the pixel-binning efforts, the selfies from the Honor 10 Lite’s 24MP front camera also come out decently well. Sure Honor boosts up the beautifying effects by default but they can be turned off to get a more realistic portrait of people’s faces. It also seemed to work enough in the dark. Apart from binning the pixels together, it also makes the screen bright to use as a source of light. The resulting photos have the background dark and noisy, but the faces are in focus with adequate sharpness., , The Honor 10 Lite have some traits in common with the Honor 8X - The same chipset and a big display among them, but one place where it crucially deviates is the battery capacity. The 10 Lite packs a smaller 3400mAh battery. The company believes the 12nm chipset will be more power efficient and will compensate for the lower capacity. But that's not totally the case. Especially while gaming, the battery drain is higher than normal. A 30-minute session of PubG Mobile drained the battery from 45 percent to 23 percent. While watching content on Netflix, the drain is more conservative however, perhaps because it's not running at full resolution. On PCMark Work 2.0 though, the phone lasted 5 hours 24 minutes, indicating you won't have to plug the phone in charge before evening. The phone also doesn't seem to support any sort of fast charging and topping the battery takes around 1.5 hours. Clearly this isn't the mid-ranger to buy if you're looking for a really long battery life., The Honor 10 Lite may have come out earlier in China, but for India, it comes just on time. With Mobile World Congress just a month away, the Honor 10 Lite is filling a critical gap in time before more innovative devices come to market. Mid-range phones have performed impressively over the past year and are set to become even more powerful in 2019. While this smartphone does come with the performance expected from a 2019 mid-range phone, there are certain elements that should have been left behind in the past year itself, such as the microUSB port and the inability to stream videos in HD from Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. However, with an almost borderless screen and above average cameras, it’s easy to recommend the Honor 10 Lite. If you need a phone right now, between the Realme 2 Pro, Mi A2, Redmi Note 6 Pro and the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, the Honor 10 Lite is definitely the one to go for. However, in the next few months post MWC, we do expect more exciting mid-range smartphones to be available, so if you can wait, you may better choices a few months down the line."

However, in the next few months post MWC, we do expect more exciting mid-range smartphones to be available, so if you can wait, you may better choices a few months down the line., , After launching a series of smartphones ranging from the high-end to entry-level price range, Honor has more or less consolidated its lineup in 2018. The blitzkreig also proved to be profitable for the company as it broke into the top 5 smartphone manufacturers in India according to reports. It’s only obvious that the Huawei sub-brand is now looking to maintain the momentum it gathered last year. The Honor 10 Lite is a way to keep that momentum alive. With a large display, a new processor and a colourful finish, the Honor 10 Lite looks to emulate the success the Honor 9 Lite received at the beginning of 2018. However, because of the mid-range elements in the phone, the phone is priced much higher than its predecessor going all the way up to Rs 17,999. One might argue that the average selling price in the Indian smartphone market has also increased (thanks mostly to the success of high-end devices like OnePlus 6), and as such, the price is more or less acceptable, but with Rs 17,999 to spare, is the Honor 10 Lite the best phone to buy right now? Let’s find out., Huawei Honor 8C 64GB Review, Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, , The Honor 10 Lite looks much like other Honor phones. It has a similar colour treatment with a glossy, reflective exterior. Only, instead of the usual glass panel on the back, the chassis is made out of hard plastic. The company promises high durability, but I wasn’t convinced. Just like the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, it gets scratched easily. It also tends to retain more smudges and fingerprints. I had to keep a microfibre cloth with me at all times to keep the phone spotless. You do get a TPU case out of the box but using that takes away the charm of the glossy finish., , The phone also curves at the edges making it easy to grip. Honor anyway likes to maintain a slim profile and the Honor 10 Lite is quite slim at 8mm. It’s not as wide as the Honor 8X even though the company relies on the same Chip-On-Flex (COF) technology to keep the size of the bezels at the bare minimum. As a result, Honor was able to achieve an impressive 91 percent screen-to-body ratio. With a tiny U-shaped notch housing the front camera, the upper part of the display is also void of much distraction. Between the wide rectangular notch and this one, I prefer the latter simply because it takes up much less space. Since the company did away with a wide notch, all the other elements like the LED notification light and the proximity sensor had to be fitted at the bottom., The biggest quip I have about the Honor 10 Lite is that it still relies on a microUSB port for charging and data transfer. The port is wedged between the 3.5mm headphone jack (thankfully retained) and the speaker grill, and doesn’t support the company’s SuperCharge speeds. I believe it’s now time for the microUSB to retire and make way for USB-C universally., , Nevertheless, the Honor 10 looks good, but I won’t go as far as saying it’s well-built. Plastic isn’t quite durable which is the reason OEMs raced to use aluminium and ceramic and even titanium to make them long-lasting. I would still say it’s better than using glass as it makes the phone less fragile and also allows the space to experiment with various colour treatments. The Honor 10 Lite has a 3D optical effect that takes a lot of effort to accomplish, according to Honor, and while that’s not a new look anymore, it does add a bit of flair to the phone., The display on the Honor 10 Lite is one of the highlights of the phone. The 6.21-inch panel stretches almost all the way to the edges thanks to the CoF technique Honor pulled off. The waterdrop notch on top also allows for more screen real estate. Honor uses a similar LCD panel as the Honor 8X which we had noted to be quite bright. Even the Honor 10 Lite registered high brightness values in our luminescence tests.

The blues and greens appear more saturated while the reds and yellows seem a little washed out. The display is especially good for gaming though. The borderless panel immerses you in the game and the extra real estate comes handy when you have large hands., , While it’s nice to have a bright and vibrant display and a cool design, the performance will always be the most essential aspect of a smartphone. If it fails to perform, everything else becomes secondary, and the Honor 10 Lite doesn’t quite disappoint. It relies on the HiSilicon Kirin 710, the same chipset that power the Honor 8X. For anyone wondering, the Honor 8X was the runner-up in the mid-range segment in our Zero1 awards where only the performance matters. The Kirin 710 is based on a 12nm manufacturing process and features four high-performance Cortex A73 cores clocked at 2.2GHz and four high-efficiency Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. While ARM has released new core architectures, the older Cortex A73 cores work quite well. In fact, as compared to the older Kirin 659 where all the eight cores were high-efficiency Cortex A53, the Kirin 710 is quite a performance jump. It reflects in the benchmark results as well. In fact, the Kirin 710 managed to trump Qualcomm’s best mid-range chip in that price range — The Snapdragon 660., , , On AnTuTu, the Honor 10 Lite scored 130849, which is similar to the Honor 8X’s 139785 and more than the Mi A2’s 128895. While on Geekbench Single and Multi core tests, the Kirin 710 showed promise by scoring 1541 and 5427 respectively. In comparison, the Honor 8X also scored similarly with 1602 and 5435 respectively while the Mi A2 scored higher in single core performance at 1602 and more or less the same in the multi-core test at 1632. While Geekbench and AnTuTu measures how well the CPU holds up, 3DMark’s Slingshot measures graphics processing and that’s where the Honor 10 Lite seems to be a little weak. It scored a measly 731 while the Mi A2 outperformed by scoring 1767. Even the Honor 8X had the same weakness, and that’s particularly because the Kirin 710 is paired with an older Mali-G51 GPU  and is no match for the Adreno GPUs., , Nevertheless, Honor compensates for that with the software-based GPU Turbo 2.0. It uses machine learning to render only parts of the frame that change over time, and as such cuts down on the processing power required. The impact is big while playing certain games like PubG Mobile. Gamebench revealed that the popular battle royale game (PubG) ran at 30 FPS while the same game on the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 ran at 26 FPS. Both are much lower than what the high-end smartphones deliver, but that’s as far as you can go with a mid-ranger it seems. GPU Turbo also supports Asphalt 9 and other popular Chinese games., , The Honor 10 Lite runs on Android 9 Pie and is the first Honor phone to come with the latest version out of the box. The new EMUI 9, based on the latest version of Android, brings new features like gesture-based navigation, digital well-being and more. The gestures are very iPhone-like, and takes a little time to get used to. You do get a little extra screen space by removing the navigation buttons. I was more interested in the Digital Balance feature which gave me a quick rundown of where my time went while on the phone. You can also set a stipulated amount of time to use the phone, and is especially useful if you’re giving a phone to your kid. There’s Huawei’s HiVision too which can be used to recognise dresses and famous objects. It did work in some cases but also failed quite a lot of times. It seems like a work in development, and as such, Honor could have just enabled support for Google Lens. Interestingly, the Honor 10 Lite can also project it’s display wirelessly to any miracast supported device. It’s not exactly a new feature, but you can use the phone as it is, while projecting a video to a screen, like how you would use Chromecast to cast content., Everything said and done, even though the Honor 10 Lite is packed with useful features, the UI itself still has the same unaesthetic feel to it. It’s not as refined and seamless as say, MIUI. It does not have the simplicity of stock Android either. It’s weird to see Honor putting so much effort to make the exterior stand out, but the phone’s software experience still has a long way to go., , Throughout 2018, we saw mid-range smartphone cameras go from strength to strength and posed quite a challenge to their expensive counterparts. The Mi A2, for instance, managed to shoot better low-light photos than a lot of other high-end offerings. Cameras have been improving over time, and that’s evident in the Honor 10 Lite. The 13+2MP setup on the Honor 10 Lite is above average. There are obvious compromises like lack of OIS or EIS, although Honor offers it’s AI-based stabilisation in the night mode which is a hit or miss., On the front is a 24MP Sony IMX 576 sensor, the same as the one on the Realme U1. The 24MP sensor bins four pixels into one to generate a better low-light selfie with more details and less noise. Part of that claim is true, but some of it isn’t quite so., Honor also implemented it’s AI-based scene recognition system that comes into play when you are taking a photo of a common scene. The camera can recognise 22 different scenes, and in most cases, it simply boosts up the local contrast and the saturation to bring out a result that the average smartphone user will find attractive., , , , The phone manages to take good photos without much effort when there’s ample sunlight. The dynamic range in the final JPEGs is a little less as the shadows retain lesser details. We have seen mid-rangers like the Mi A2 and the Redmi Note 6 Pro take photos with good details in the shadow regions. However, the photos Honor takes are aesthetically pleasing simply because it jacks up the saturation and contrast in the photos., , , The camera is especially useful in taking closeup shots of food, flowers and the likes. There, the 13MP sensor with its f/1.8 aperture is able to reproduce finer details and the results look good on a big screen. However, since there is no stabilisation in place, you need to have steady hands to click a photo of say, a flower moving in the wind. You can turn the AI off if you don’t want an oversaturated result.,  , Indoors, the camera’s somewhat low dynamic range starts becoming more evident. It tends to shoot at slower shutter speeds and because of a lack of stabilisation, even a slow shutter speed of 1/100s shows signs of blurring in the edges. In case of the sample below, the area farthest in the frame is hardly in focus and lacks sharpness. In the next sample below, the dark area have little to no detail. You can experiment with the focus point a bit to get your desired exposure, but there’s a limit to it., , The phone is especially adept at taking portrait photos. Sure it won’t have that gradient bokeh effect the new iPhones produces and the blurring is pretty linear. But the edge detection and subject separation is pretty accurate., In low-light, the camera falls flat. Shooting in normal Photo mode results in noisy photos, with little to no sharpness. However, the night mode manages to recover some details. It essentially works on the same principle as the OnePlus 6T’s Nightscape mode where the shutter is open for longer and the resulting shake is countered by taking multiple buffer images and fusing them together. The results aren’t as good as the OnePlus 6T though, but good enough for the price it is offered at. Stationery objects are easier to shoot with this mode, as you have to hold the phone up for longer., , Thanks to the pixel-binning efforts, the selfies from the Honor 10 Lite’s 24MP front camera also come out decently well. Sure Honor boosts up the beautifying effects by default but they can be turned off to get a more realistic portrait of people’s faces. It also seemed to work enough in the dark. Apart from binning the pixels together, it also makes the screen bright to use as a source of light. The resulting photos have the background dark and noisy, but the faces are in focus with adequate sharpness., , The Honor 10 Lite have some traits in common with the Honor 8X - The same chipset and a big display among them, but one place where it crucially deviates is the battery capacity. The 10 Lite packs a smaller 3400mAh battery. The company believes the 12nm chipset will be more power efficient and will compensate for the lower capacity. But that's not totally the case. Especially while gaming, the battery drain is higher than normal. A 30-minute session of PubG Mobile drained the battery from 45 percent to 23 percent. While watching content on Netflix, the drain is more conservative however, perhaps because it's not running at full resolution. On PCMark Work 2.0 though, the phone lasted 5 hours 24 minutes, indicating you won't have to plug the phone in charge before evening. The phone also doesn't seem to support any sort of fast charging and topping the battery takes around 1.5 hours. Clearly this isn't the mid-ranger to buy if you're looking for a really long battery life., The Honor 10 Lite may have come out earlier in China, but for India, it comes just on time. With Mobile World Congress just a month away, the Honor 10 Lite is filling a critical gap in time before more innovative devices come to market. Mid-range phones have performed impressively over the past year and are set to become even more powerful in 2019. While this smartphone does come with the performance expected from a 2019 mid-range phone, there are certain elements that should have been left behind in the past year itself, such as the microUSB port and the inability to stream videos in HD from Netflix or Amazon Prime Video. However, with an almost borderless screen and above average cameras, it’s easy to recommend the Honor 10 Lite. If you need a phone right now, between the Realme 2 Pro, Mi A2, Redmi Note 6 Pro and the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, the Honor 10 Lite is definitely the one to go for. However, in the next few months post MWC, we do expect more exciting mid-range smartphones to be available, so if you can wait, you may better choices a few months down the line."

However, in the next few months post MWC, we do expect more exciting mid-range smartphones to be available, so if you can wait, you may better choices a few months down the line., , After launching a series of smartphones ranging from the high-end to entry-level price range, Honor has more or less consolidated its lineup in 2018. The blitzkreig also proved to be profitable for the company as it broke into the top 5 smartphone manufacturers in India according to reports. It’s only obvious that the Huawei sub-brand is now looking to maintain the momentum it gathered last year. The Honor 10 Lite is a way to keep that momentum alive. With a large display, a new processor and a colourful finish, the Honor 10 Lite looks to emulate the success the Honor 9 Lite received at the beginning of 2018. However, because of the mid-range elements in the phone, the phone is priced much higher than its predecessor going all the way up to Rs 17,999. One might argue that the average selling price in the Indian smartphone market has also increased (thanks mostly to the success of high-end devices like OnePlus 6), and as such, the price is more or less acceptable, but with Rs 17,999 to spare, is the Honor 10 Lite the best phone to buy right now? Let’s find out., Huawei Honor 8C 64GB Review, Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, , The Honor 10 Lite looks much like other Honor phones. It has a similar colour treatment with a glossy, reflective exterior. Only, instead of the usual glass panel on the back, the chassis is made out of hard plastic. The company promises high durability, but I wasn’t convinced. Just like the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, it gets scratched easily. It also tends to retain more smudges and fingerprints. I had to keep a microfibre cloth with me at all times to keep the phone spotless. You do get a TPU case out of the box but using that takes away the charm of the glossy finish., , The phone also curves at the edges making it easy to grip. Honor anyway likes to maintain a slim profile and the Honor 10 Lite is quite slim at 8mm. It’s not as wide as the Honor 8X even though the company relies on the same Chip-On-Flex (COF) technology to keep the size of the bezels at the bare minimum. As a result, Honor was able to achieve an impressive 91 percent screen-to-body ratio. With a tiny U-shaped notch housing the front camera, the upper part of the display is also void of much distraction. Between the wide rectangular notch and this one, I prefer the latter simply because it takes up much less space. Since the company did away with a wide notch, all the other elements like the LED notification light and the proximity sensor had to be fitted at the bottom., The biggest quip I have about the Honor 10 Lite is that it still relies on a microUSB port for charging and data transfer. The port is wedged between the 3.5mm headphone jack (thankfully retained) and the speaker grill, and doesn’t support the company’s SuperCharge speeds. I believe it’s now time for the microUSB to retire and make way for USB-C universally., , Nevertheless, the Honor 10 looks good, but I won’t go as far as saying it’s well-built. Plastic isn’t quite durable which is the reason OEMs raced to use aluminium and ceramic and even titanium to make them long-lasting. I would still say it’s better than using glass as it makes the phone less fragile and also allows the space to experiment with various colour treatments. The Honor 10 Lite has a 3D optical effect that takes a lot of effort to accomplish, according to Honor, and while that’s not a new look anymore, it does add a bit of flair to the phone., The display on the Honor 10 Lite is one of the highlights of the phone. The 6.21-inch panel stretches almost all the way to the edges thanks to the CoF technique Honor pulled off. The waterdrop notch on top also allows for more screen real estate. Honor uses a similar LCD panel as the Honor 8X which we had noted to be quite bright. Even the Honor 10 Lite registered high brightness values in our luminescence tests. As such, content on the 19.5:9 aspect ratio display looks good particularly thanks to a high 415 ppi pixel density. The icons appear quite sharp and bright wallpapers appear rich and vibrant. However, the phone lacks the Widevine L1 certification, so even if the display makes HD content appear rich and colourful, you won’t get the same quality while streaming on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video and the likes., , The panel also seems to have its white balance set to a cooler bias rather than the neutral white we normally expect from IPS LCD panels..

2256,42,huawei-honor-7c-review-128881,0,0,2019-05-12,128881,Vignesh Giridharan,Huawei Honor 7C Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/huawei-honor-7c-review-128881.html,"The Honor 7C offers above-average performance overall. Choose it if you want a dual-camera setup for daylight photos with a bokeh effect, a large 18:9 display, good battery life, and Android 8.0 Oreo out-of-the-box. Performance isn’t the best out there, especially when compared with the Redmis on sale, but it certainly gets things done., , The Honor 7C is one of the two smartphones from Honor to feature a Qualcomm chipset instead of the usual Huawei-manufactured Kirin chipset. The other phone is the less expensive Honor 7A. With its large 18:9 screen and dual-lens camera setup, it takes on the likes of Xiaomi’s Redmi Y2 and Redmi Note 5. The 3GB RAM/32GB storage version costs Rs 9,999 and the 4GB RAM/64GB storage version, Rs 11,999 on Amazon.in. The model reviewed here is the costlier one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage., Huawei Honor 8C 64GB Review, Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Huawei Honor 10 Lite Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, Design, The Honor 7C sticks largely to the design vocabulary set by other Honor 7-series phones from the past and the present: it’s a phone with a sharp, rectangular display that sits inside a body with curvy corners. The Honor 7C can easily be mistaken for the slightly smaller Honor 7A. So not many marks for originality then. The back of the phone is made mostly of thin metal that can prove to become slippery in the hand while lifting and holding. On the bright side, it doesn’t give in easily to smudges and scratches., The left side houses the tray for SIM cards and microSD card. The right side houses the power button and volume rocker, which I found to be placed too close to each other for comfort. With no knurling on the surface of the power button, there’s a good chance you’ll end up mistakenly pressing one for the other. The bottom edge contains a 3.5mm audio jack, the aging microUSB port, a microphone, and a speaker grille. The top edge is bald. With its 18:9 5.99-inch display, the Honor 7C is quite a large phone. It might feel difficult to hold if you have small hands., Honor’s EMUI 8.0 user interface is simple enough to use but comes with a fair amount of bloatware. Font size of text tends to become inconsistent in some of the screens. It has a ‘Ride mode’ app that enables only essential functions when the user is riding a motorcycle or scooter, something that might be handy for conscientious riders. It also has a ‘Simple mode’, which turns on a simplified version of the home screen with large, easy-to-read icons, a feature that can prove useful for the aged. , Display, The Honor 7C comes with a 5.99-inch ‘FullView’ display. The 18:9 aspect ratio makes it larger along the y-axis than the x, which is a big plus point if you’re buying the phone to play a lot of videos and games. Its resolution of 720 x 1440 pixels seems sufficient on paper, but real-world usage gives you the feeling that too little butter has been applied over too much bread. Window elements, especially on apps like Chrome and  Facebook, look larger than necessary. There’s no option to decrease their size in Settings either. You can, however, decrease the font size., Colours in general tend to appear on the cooler side on this device. The IPS LCD panel reproduces colours with moderate vividness. Browns and reds seem noticeably dull though. On the bright side (caution: bad pun ahead), the screen offers 457 lux of luminance, which is sufficient for daytime sunlight legibility. At about 170 degrees, the maximum horizontal viewing angle is pretty wide, while vertical viewing angle is somewhat narrow. All in all, it’s a serviceable display for a phone of its price. A little more colour would’ve been welcome though., Performance, Surprisingly, the Honor 7C, along with the smaller Honor 7A, is powered not by a Huawei-made Kirin chipset, but by a Qualcomm-made Snapdragon 450 chipset with an octa-core processor. The Honor 7C scored 717 on Geekbench’s single-core test and 3555 on the multi-core test, which is only a little lower than what the Motorola Moto G6 had scored a couple of weeks ago: 744 on the Geekbench single-core test and 3888 on the multi-core test. The 32GB version of the Moto G6—which also sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 chipset—is Rs 4,000 dearer than the 32GB version of the Honor 7C, it must be noted. The processor and memory combination is sufficient for everyday tasks like phone calls, music and video playback, and light browsing and gaming., On Chrome, I was able to toggle between fourteen open tabs comfortably without any lag; Chrome retained all fourteen pages in memory. Understandably, as the tab count rose, it was forced to reload the older inactive pages. With thirty tabs open (and one of them playing a YouTube video), scrolling through a single page became understandably jittery, but not by much. Luckily, toggling between the tabs still remained steady and quick enough., The phone’s body warmed up to 33 degrees Celsius while gaming but never felt uncomfortably hot to hold at any point. To turn the heat up some more, I opened two more apps and minimised them as they were launching. I left a half-typed draft in Messages and a half-dialled number in Phone. I then left a game running and returned to Chrome to find the pages still fairly responsive. I thought memory was well managed until I opened the previously minimised YouTube app. Then the phone turned unresponsive to touches and button clicks for a good four minutes before recovering completely., In summary, performance on the phone in this price range is still not bad. As long as you don’t intend to multitask heavily, you should be fine. You should be able to book tickets to a movie while texting your friends to ask them which seats they want and keep an eye on the match scores and listen to your favourite pop tunes at the same time without any problems., Camera, Glancing at the spec sheet tells us the Honor 7C has a dual-lens camera setup on the back: one 13-megapixel sensor combined with a 2-megapixel ‘depth detection’ sensor, and that the front shooter is an 8-megapixel sensor with an aperture of f/2.0. It has a flash not only on the back, but on the front as well, in the form of an ‘intelligent adjustable selfie toning light.’, , Selfie with Soft Flash turned off, , Selfie with Soft Flash turned on, In reality, the camera fares decently in most conditions. Though it supports face recognition, focussing by tapping on an object in the viewfinder screen takes long. Shutter lag isn’t noticeable all the time, but I did come across moments when I was made to wait because the phone was still busy focussing. Indoor photos in a typical office with sufficient lighting are bright enough but suffer from noise. Predictably, the noise increases as the light diminishes. Browns and blues turn to blacks easily. Focussing in the dark takes much longer, and many times you end up with blurry shots even though the shutter waits for the focussing to complete., , There's an option to keep flash on constantly, even while focussing, , Focussing takes much longer in dark environments, Colours seem cooler than they are in reality even when viewed on a larger computer display. The ‘Wide Aperture Mode’ helps you keep the focus on one object and blur out the rest. It works quite well with faces and irregularly-shaped objects like coffee cups and flowers. No important features of the foreground object are cut off or blurred mistakenly., , Adjustable Wide Aperture Mode turned off, , Adjustable Wide Aperture Mode turned up halfway, , Adjustable Wide Aperture Mode turned up all the way, , Adjustable Wide Aperture Mode set to minimum, , Adjustable Wide Aperture Mode set to maximum, The wide front camera, though decent in quality, makes photos look a little overexposed and grainy even when there’s ample light around the subject. The soft flash in the front aids in bringing more light to the shot but does nothing to reduce noise. An adjustable ‘Beauty’ slider on the front and back camera wipes out facial blemishes., , A grainy indoor selfie of yours truly, Battery, The 3,000mAh battery on the Honor 7C lasts at least a full day on a single charge while loading the phone with an ample amount of screen-on time, photo capturing, and browsing. Running navigation on Google Maps with the screen brightness turned up halfway for fifteen minutes saw a 5-percent drop in battery, which is respectable. On a recent trip, I had Google Maps’ navigation running for three straight hours with the screen on at 70 percent brightness. This caused a fifty-percent drop in charge., , The odd UI bug here or there never hurt anybody, Charging up from 19 percent to 46 percent happened in a span of twenty minutes. A full charge happened in a couple of hours. So, as far as battery life goes, the one on the Honor 7C is definitely a dependable one, if not a remarkably long-lasting one., Bottom line, The Honor 7C is a smartphone that offers decent value for your money if you’re looking for a model with a large 18:9 display, an adequate dual-camera setup, and a good battery life. The Xiaomi Redmi Y2 and Redmi Note 5 trump the Honor 7C by featuring a superior Qualcomm chipset, but the 7C’s chipset is not a bad one  by any means."

Choose it if you want a dual-camera setup for daylight photos with a bokeh effect, a large 18:9 display, good battery life, and Android 8.0 Oreo out-of-the-box. Performance isn’t the best out there, especially when compared with the Redmis on sale, but it certainly gets things done., , The Honor 7C is one of the two smartphones from Honor to feature a Qualcomm chipset instead of the usual Huawei-manufactured Kirin chipset. The other phone is the less expensive Honor 7A. With its large 18:9 screen and dual-lens camera setup, it takes on the likes of Xiaomi’s Redmi Y2 and Redmi Note 5. The 3GB RAM/32GB storage version costs Rs 9,999 and the 4GB RAM/64GB storage version, Rs 11,999 on Amazon.in. The model reviewed here is the costlier one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage., Huawei Honor 8C 64GB Review, Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Huawei Honor 10 Lite Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, Design, The Honor 7C sticks largely to the design vocabulary set by other Honor 7-series phones from the past and the present: it’s a phone with a sharp, rectangular display that sits inside a body with curvy corners. The Honor 7C can easily be mistaken for the slightly smaller Honor 7A. So not many marks for originality then. The back of the phone is made mostly of thin metal that can prove to become slippery in the hand while lifting and holding. On the bright side, it doesn’t give in easily to smudges and scratches., The left side houses the tray for SIM cards and microSD card. The right side houses the power button and volume rocker, which I found to be placed too close to each other for comfort. With no knurling on the surface of the power button, there’s a good chance you’ll end up mistakenly pressing one for the other. The bottom edge contains a 3.5mm audio jack, the aging microUSB port, a microphone, and a speaker grille. The top edge is bald. With its 18:9 5.99-inch display, the Honor 7C is quite a large phone. It might feel difficult to hold if you have small hands., Honor’s EMUI 8.0 user interface is simple enough to use but comes with a fair amount of bloatware. Font size of text tends to become inconsistent in some of the screens. It has a ‘Ride mode’ app that enables only essential functions when the user is riding a motorcycle or scooter, something that might be handy for conscientious riders. It also has a ‘Simple mode’, which turns on a simplified version of the home screen with large, easy-to-read icons, a feature that can prove useful for the aged. , Display, The Honor 7C comes with a 5.99-inch ‘FullView’ display. The 18:9 aspect ratio makes it larger along the y-axis than the x, which is a big plus point if you’re buying the phone to play a lot of videos and games. Its resolution of 720 x 1440 pixels seems sufficient on paper, but real-world usage gives you the feeling that too little butter has been applied over too much bread. Window elements, especially on apps like Chrome and  Facebook, look larger than necessary. There’s no option to decrease their size in Settings either. You can, however, decrease the font size., Colours in general tend to appear on the cooler side on this device. The IPS LCD panel reproduces colours with moderate vividness. Browns and reds seem noticeably dull though. On the bright side (caution: bad pun ahead), the screen offers 457 lux of luminance, which is sufficient for daytime sunlight legibility. At about 170 degrees, the maximum horizontal viewing angle is pretty wide, while vertical viewing angle is somewhat narrow. All in all, it’s a serviceable display for a phone of its price. A little more colour would’ve been welcome though., Performance, Surprisingly, the Honor 7C, along with the smaller Honor 7A, is powered not by a Huawei-made Kirin chipset, but by a Qualcomm-made Snapdragon 450 chipset with an octa-core processor. The Honor 7C scored 717 on Geekbench’s single-core test and 3555 on the multi-core test, which is only a little lower than what the Motorola Moto G6 had scored a couple of weeks ago: 744 on the Geekbench single-core test and 3888 on the multi-core test. The 32GB version of the Moto G6—which also sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 chipset—is Rs 4,000 dearer than the 32GB version of the Honor 7C, it must be noted. The processor and memory combination is sufficient for everyday tasks like phone calls, music and video playback, and light browsing and gaming., On Chrome, I was able to toggle between fourteen open tabs comfortably without any lag; Chrome retained all fourteen pages in memory. Understandably, as the tab count rose, it was forced to reload the older inactive pages. With thirty tabs open (and one of them playing a YouTube video), scrolling through a single page became understandably jittery, but not by much. Luckily, toggling between the tabs still remained steady and quick enough., The phone’s body warmed up to 33 degrees Celsius while gaming but never felt uncomfortably hot to hold at any point. To turn the heat up some more, I opened two more apps and minimised them as they were launching. I left a half-typed draft in Messages and a half-dialled number in Phone. I then left a game running and returned to Chrome to find the pages still fairly responsive. I thought memory was well managed until I opened the previously minimised YouTube app. Then the phone turned unresponsive to touches and button clicks for a good four minutes before recovering completely., In summary, performance on the phone in this price range is still not bad.

The 3GB RAM/32GB storage version costs Rs 9,999 and the 4GB RAM/64GB storage version, Rs 11,999 on Amazon.in. The model reviewed here is the costlier one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage., Huawei Honor 8C 64GB Review, Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Huawei Honor 10 Lite Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, Design, The Honor 7C sticks largely to the design vocabulary set by other Honor 7-series phones from the past and the present: it’s a phone with a sharp, rectangular display that sits inside a body with curvy corners. The Honor 7C can easily be mistaken for the slightly smaller Honor 7A. So not many marks for originality then. The back of the phone is made mostly of thin metal that can prove to become slippery in the hand while lifting and holding. On the bright side, it doesn’t give in easily to smudges and scratches., The left side houses the tray for SIM cards and microSD card. The right side houses the power button and volume rocker, which I found to be placed too close to each other for comfort. With no knurling on the surface of the power button, there’s a good chance you’ll end up mistakenly pressing one for the other. The bottom edge contains a 3.5mm audio jack, the aging microUSB port, a microphone, and a speaker grille. The top edge is bald. With its 18:9 5.99-inch display, the Honor 7C is quite a large phone. It might feel difficult to hold if you have small hands., Honor’s EMUI 8.0 user interface is simple enough to use but comes with a fair amount of bloatware. Font size of text tends to become inconsistent in some of the screens. It has a ‘Ride mode’ app that enables only essential functions when the user is riding a motorcycle or scooter, something that might be handy for conscientious riders. It also has a ‘Simple mode’, which turns on a simplified version of the home screen with large, easy-to-read icons, a feature that can prove useful for the aged. , Display, The Honor 7C comes with a 5.99-inch ‘FullView’ display. The 18:9 aspect ratio makes it larger along the y-axis than the x, which is a big plus point if you’re buying the phone to play a lot of videos and games. Its resolution of 720 x 1440 pixels seems sufficient on paper, but real-world usage gives you the feeling that too little butter has been applied over too much bread. Window elements, especially on apps like Chrome and  Facebook, look larger than necessary. There’s no option to decrease their size in Settings either. You can, however, decrease the font size., Colours in general tend to appear on the cooler side on this device. The IPS LCD panel reproduces colours with moderate vividness. Browns and reds seem noticeably dull though. On the bright side (caution: bad pun ahead), the screen offers 457 lux of luminance, which is sufficient for daytime sunlight legibility. At about 170 degrees, the maximum horizontal viewing angle is pretty wide, while vertical viewing angle is somewhat narrow. All in all, it’s a serviceable display for a phone of its price. A little more colour would’ve been welcome though., Performance, Surprisingly, the Honor 7C, along with the smaller Honor 7A, is powered not by a Huawei-made Kirin chipset, but by a Qualcomm-made Snapdragon 450 chipset with an octa-core processor. The Honor 7C scored 717 on Geekbench’s single-core test and 3555 on the multi-core test, which is only a little lower than what the Motorola Moto G6 had scored a couple of weeks ago: 744 on the Geekbench single-core test and 3888 on the multi-core test. The 32GB version of the Moto G6—which also sports a Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 chipset—is Rs 4,000 dearer than the 32GB version of the Honor 7C, it must be noted. The processor and memory combination is sufficient for everyday tasks like phone calls, music and video playback, and light browsing and gaming., On Chrome, I was able to toggle between fourteen open tabs comfortably without any lag; Chrome retained all fourteen pages in memory. Understandably, as the tab count rose, it was forced to reload the older inactive pages. With thirty tabs open (and one of them playing a YouTube video), scrolling through a single page became understandably jittery, but not by much. Luckily, toggling between the tabs still remained steady and quick enough., The phone’s body warmed up to 33 degrees Celsius while gaming but never felt uncomfortably hot to hold at any point. To turn the heat up some more, I opened two more apps and minimised them as they were launching. I left a half-typed draft in Messages and a half-dialled number in Phone. I then left a game running and returned to Chrome to find the pages still fairly responsive. I thought memory was well managed until I opened the previously minimised YouTube app. Then the phone turned unresponsive to touches and button clicks for a good four minutes before recovering completely., In summary, performance on the phone in this price range is still not bad. As long as you don’t intend to multitask heavily, you should be fine. You should be able to book tickets to a movie while texting your friends to ask them which seats they want and keep an eye on the match scores and listen to your favourite pop tunes at the same time without any problems., Camera, Glancing at the spec sheet tells us the Honor 7C has a dual-lens camera setup on the back: one 13-megapixel sensor combined with a 2-megapixel ‘depth detection’ sensor, and that the front shooter is an 8-megapixel sensor with an aperture of f/2.0. It has a flash not only on the back, but on the front as well, in the form of an ‘intelligent adjustable selfie toning light.’, , Selfie with Soft Flash turned off, , Selfie with Soft Flash turned on, In reality, the camera fares decently in most conditions. Though it supports face recognition, focussing by tapping on an object in the viewfinder screen takes long. Shutter lag isn’t noticeable all the time, but I did come across moments when I was made to wait because the phone was still busy focussing. Indoor photos in a typical office with sufficient lighting are bright enough but suffer from noise. Predictably, the noise increases as the light diminishes. Browns and blues turn to blacks easily. Focussing in the dark takes much longer, and many times you end up with blurry shots even though the shutter waits for the focussing to complete., , There's an option to keep flash on constantly, even while focussing, , Focussing takes much longer in dark environments, Colours seem cooler than they are in reality even when viewed on a larger computer display. The ‘Wide Aperture Mode’ helps you keep the focus on one object and blur out the rest. It works quite well with faces and irregularly-shaped objects like coffee cups and flowers. No important features of the foreground object are cut off or blurred mistakenly., , Adjustable Wide Aperture Mode turned off, , Adjustable Wide Aperture Mode turned up halfway, , Adjustable Wide Aperture Mode turned up all the way, , Adjustable Wide Aperture Mode set to minimum, , Adjustable Wide Aperture Mode set to maximum, The wide front camera, though decent in quality, makes photos look a little overexposed and grainy even when there’s ample light around the subject. The soft flash in the front aids in bringing more light to the shot but does nothing to reduce noise. An adjustable ‘Beauty’ slider on the front and back camera wipes out facial blemishes., , A grainy indoor selfie of yours truly, Battery, The 3,000mAh battery on the Honor 7C lasts at least a full day on a single charge while loading the phone with an ample amount of screen-on time, photo capturing, and browsing. Running navigation on Google Maps with the screen brightness turned up halfway for fifteen minutes saw a 5-percent drop in battery, which is respectable. On a recent trip, I had Google Maps’ navigation running for three straight hours with the screen on at 70 percent brightness. This caused a fifty-percent drop in charge., , The odd UI bug here or there never hurt anybody, Charging up from 19 percent to 46 percent happened in a span of twenty minutes. A full charge happened in a couple of hours. So, as far as battery life goes, the one on the Honor 7C is definitely a dependable one, if not a remarkably long-lasting one., Bottom line, The Honor 7C is a smartphone that offers decent value for your money if you’re looking for a model with a large 18:9 display, an adequate dual-camera setup, and a good battery life. The Xiaomi Redmi Y2 and Redmi Note 5 trump the Honor 7C by featuring a superior Qualcomm chipset, but the 7C’s chipset is not a bad one  by any means."

It has a great display and good battery life and the overall performance is average at best. It loses out to the Mi A1 as far as the camera is concerned and graphically heavy games like Asphalt 8 stutter on the device. You can consider it if you aren’t a heavy smartphone user and like reading content or watching movies on the go, as the display on the smartphone is indeed good. But if the camera is something you are finicky about and aren't a fan of skinned OSes, then you may want to consider your options., , UPDATE: The Price for the Honor 7X was announced on 5th December. The device is available in two variants in India – 4GB RAM and 32GB storage priced at Rs 12,999 and 4GB RAM with 64GB storage priced at Rs 15,999. , Huawei Honor 8C 64GB Review, Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Huawei Honor 10 Lite Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, Honor has launched an interesting portfolio of smartphones here in 2017, including the Honor 8 Pro, Honor 9i and the Honor 6X to name some. Today we have the successor to the Honor 6X, predictably called the Honor 7X. As of writing this review, the price of the smartphone hasn’t been revealed so we are presuming that it is priced under Rs 15000. This means that it will compete with the likes of the Moto G5 Plus, Lenovo K8 Plus, Redmi Note 4, and the current heavyweight champion of the sub 15k category, the Xiaomi Mi A1. Does it have what it takes to become the king of the hill?, Specifications at a glance:, Thickness: 7.6mm
Weight: 165 grams
CPU: Kirin 659 Octa-Core CPU
OS & UI: Android 7.1 with EMUI 5.1
Display: 5.93-inch 18:9 display
Display resolution: 2160x1080p
Rear Camera: 16MP+2MP
Front camera: 8MP
RAM: 4GB
Built-in storage: 32/64GB. NOTE: the review unit we received has 128GB built-in storage
Battery: 3340mAh, Build and Design, Speaking of the build, the Honor 7X is as premium as the Mi A1 and that isn't a bad thing. The smartphone has a metal build with curved edges. It is ever so slightly taller than the Mi A1 and thanks to the 18:9 form factor, it has thin bezels on the sides. The top and bottom bezels are quite thick and the phone has an attractive design. These bezels are thin enough that they add to the aesthetics of the smartphone and yet thick enough so that your palm doesn’t accidentally touch the screen if you are trying to reach one of the top corners during single-handed use. The top and bottom bezels are thick enough to comfortably hold the phone in landscape mode for watching movies and playing games. , At the back, you have the fingerprint sensor conveniently located. You also have the dual-camera setup which is protruding. I wish the dual camera setup was as seamless as it was on the Honor 8 Pro., , The right side of the smartphone has the power button and the volume rocker. The buttons are clicky and feel good. At the bottom, we have the micro-USB port for charging, which is a bummer in a USB-C dominated market. You also have the headphone jack and the speaker grill on either side of the USB port., Speaking of the design, the smartphone has the standard candy bar 18:9 design we’d expect in this price and the curved edges make it comfortable to hold with one hand. Although reaching all corners of the phone isn’t easy with single-handed use, it is fairly ergonomic., Overall, the build and design of the Honor 7X is good. The 18:9 display is a good addition when compared to other phones in the same price range., Display and Sound, As we’ve mentioned above, the smartphone has an 18:9 display for watching content. We faced no issue with the display on every day use. Apps that haven’t been optimized for the new aspect ratio show a black bar at the bottom with the option to stretch it to full screen. There are however some apps and games, like Asphalt 8, that run in full screen and take advantage of the new display. There are some 18:9 specific videos on YouTube as well and if you are watching the new Avengers: Infinity War trailer on the device, you can simply pinch to fit and enjoy the trailer in full screen. , Other apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, Gmail, Chrome, etc. work well on the new aspect ratio. No complaints here., If there is a complaint it’s with the audio quality from the speaker. Watching YouTube content including movie trailers, cinematic video game trailers, talk shows, Ted Talks, etc. is very underwhelming. The background score of the movie trailer and the vocals seem muddled. The same can be said for music videos. , , When playing games like Asphalt 8, the audio from the speaker is underwhelming too and sounds muddled. , When taking calls on the speakerphone, the voice is clear but the maximum volume is lower than what I’d expect from a smartphone., Coming back to the display, it has a maximum luminance of 417 lux. It isn’t the brightest display out there and sunlight visibility does suffer, but if you are going to read web pages or Kindle books, you should be fine with auto brightness. You may want to bump up the brightness manually while watching movies though., For those of you finicky about the colour temperature of the device, you can manually change it between default, warm and cold. You also have the ability to manually adjust it to your preference. There's even an eye comfort mode that essentially filters out blue light., Overall, the display is very good and supports a pretty wide colour gamut. You will enjoy watching movies on it, but audio is an issue. , UI, The Honor 7X has the company’s own EMUI overlaying Android Nougat. The UI has some interesting features. If you like, you can have an iOS-like layout where all the apps are present on the home screen. Or if you are one that prefers an app drawer, then that option is there too. The phone comes with a bunch of preloaded apps and games. There is one pre-loaded app I found quite interesting. In the tools folder, there is a Mirror app. It essentially uses the front-facing camera of the smartphone and you can zoom in as well if you want. It has a bunch of mirror frames to choose from and in case you want to check out your hair before that big date, I suggest you give this app a shot instead of opening the front-facing camera., There is another interesting feature on the phone called WiFi bridge. Through this, the current WiFI network can be shared with other devices. This is very useful in a scenario where you have access to WiFi on only one device, but need the access for other devices too. Do remember, this feature on the Honor 7X is a battery guzzler., , Overall, the UI is fairly fluid and if you have used an Honor phone in the past, you will feel right at home. There are times when the UI stuttered during heavy multitasking and a few times when Facebook didn’t respond, but apart from that, the average user shouldn’t face any issues., Performance, Let’s talk about the call performance. The audio is crisp and clear at both ends. The earpiece is loud and there is audio leaking when it is at full volume. So, if you are in a car and the earpiece is at full volume, the person sitting next to you can easily eavesdrop on the conversation. At about 60% volume, the earpiece works perfectly well. There are also some places in my house where the network is an issue but the Honor 7X managed to grab better cellular reception than other phones in this case. , Running everyday apps like Facebook, Whatsapp, YouTube, Netflix, and more is a breeze. The smartphone multitasks well and stutters only when you run heavy apps and games back to back. , The biggest downside to the performance of the smartphone was gaming. Casual games like Farm Hero Saga ran well but graphically heavy games like Asphalt 8 showed patchy framerates. When there are a bunch of cars on screen, the framerate really drops. If you are one that wants to play graphically heavy games on the device, you may want to look at other options. , When it comes to benchmarks, the performance is at par with the Honor 9i and this isn’t surprising since both phones are powered by the same SoC. Here is a look at the benchmark scores of the Honor 7X against some competing devices., , Overall, the performance of the device is not groundbreaking, but it has just enough to keep the average user happy. There aren’t any troubling heating issues with the smartphone either., Camera, Moving to the camera, the Honor 7X has a dual camera setup with one 16MP camera and another 2MP camera. Photos clicked in well-lit situations have colours that are true to the source. However, for a phone priced around 15k, there are smartphones with better cameras. Low light photos also present the problem of noise especially when the light is really low. Since the smartphone has a dual camera setup, you’d expect it to click good bokeh photos. However, that isn’t the case. The bokeh photos are average at best and the camera on the Honor 7X isn’t as groundbreaking as they were on the Honor 6X, with respect to their respective competitors. If a camera is of utmost importance to you, you are better off considering the Mi A1., , Below are some of the camera samples (resized for web), , , , , ,  , Battery life, Using the phone for about a week, the smartphone can last you a little more than a 9 to 5 day with above average use. With brightness on auto, and 100% battery at 10am the phone was at about 20% battery when I got home at 8PM, which is good considering usage. We made many calls and sent many texts during the day, clicked some images, watched YouTube videos, Facebooking and some light gaming. The smartphone lasted for about eight and a half hours on the PC Mark Battery Test, which isn’t the best in this category but it isn’t bad either., How it compares, When you consider a 15K smartphone, you will look at devices like the Moto G5 Plus and the Mi A1 to name a few. The Honor 7x has a better display than the Mi A1, which means that you can enjoy movies on it a lot more. The 18:9 display also helps in this regard. However, the output from the speaker of the Mi A1 is far superior. When it comes to everyday performance, the phone is snappy and can give the Mi A1 a run for its money. Gaming performance on the Honor 7X could have been better., Bottom Line, For Rs 13,000 device, the Honor 7X isn’t the best option out there. It has a great display and good battery life and the overall performance is average at best. It loses out to the Mi A1 as far as the camera is concerned and graphically heavy games like Asphalt 8 stutter on the device. You can consider it if you aren’t a heavy smartphone user and like reading content or watching movies on the go, as the display on the smartphone is indeed good. But if the camera is something you are finicky about and aren't a fan of skinned OSes, then you may want to consider your options."

The top and bottom bezels are thick enough to comfortably hold the phone in landscape mode for watching movies and playing games. , At the back, you have the fingerprint sensor conveniently located. You also have the dual-camera setup which is protruding. I wish the dual camera setup was as seamless as it was on the Honor 8 Pro., , The right side of the smartphone has the power button and the volume rocker. The buttons are clicky and feel good. At the bottom, we have the micro-USB port for charging, which is a bummer in a USB-C dominated market. You also have the headphone jack and the speaker grill on either side of the USB port., Speaking of the design, the smartphone has the standard candy bar 18:9 design we’d expect in this price and the curved edges make it comfortable to hold with one hand. Although reaching all corners of the phone isn’t easy with single-handed use, it is fairly ergonomic., Overall, the build and design of the Honor 7X is good. The 18:9 display is a good addition when compared to other phones in the same price range., Display and Sound, As we’ve mentioned above, the smartphone has an 18:9 display for watching content. We faced no issue with the display on every day use. Apps that haven’t been optimized for the new aspect ratio show a black bar at the bottom with the option to stretch it to full screen. There are however some apps and games, like Asphalt 8, that run in full screen and take advantage of the new display. There are some 18:9 specific videos on YouTube as well and if you are watching the new Avengers: Infinity War trailer on the device, you can simply pinch to fit and enjoy the trailer in full screen. , Other apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, Gmail, Chrome, etc. work well on the new aspect ratio. No complaints here., If there is a complaint it’s with the audio quality from the speaker. Watching YouTube content including movie trailers, cinematic video game trailers, talk shows, Ted Talks, etc. is very underwhelming. The background score of the movie trailer and the vocals seem muddled. The same can be said for music videos. , , When playing games like Asphalt 8, the audio from the speaker is underwhelming too and sounds muddled. , When taking calls on the speakerphone, the voice is clear but the maximum volume is lower than what I’d expect from a smartphone., Coming back to the display, it has a maximum luminance of 417 lux. It isn’t the brightest display out there and sunlight visibility does suffer, but if you are going to read web pages or Kindle books, you should be fine with auto brightness. You may want to bump up the brightness manually while watching movies though., For those of you finicky about the colour temperature of the device, you can manually change it between default, warm and cold. You also have the ability to manually adjust it to your preference. There's even an eye comfort mode that essentially filters out blue light., Overall, the display is very good and supports a pretty wide colour gamut. You will enjoy watching movies on it, but audio is an issue. , UI, The Honor 7X has the company’s own EMUI overlaying Android Nougat. The UI has some interesting features. If you like, you can have an iOS-like layout where all the apps are present on the home screen. Or if you are one that prefers an app drawer, then that option is there too. The phone comes with a bunch of preloaded apps and games. There is one pre-loaded app I found quite interesting. In the tools folder, there is a Mirror app. It essentially uses the front-facing camera of the smartphone and you can zoom in as well if you want. It has a bunch of mirror frames to choose from and in case you want to check out your hair before that big date, I suggest you give this app a shot instead of opening the front-facing camera., There is another interesting feature on the phone called WiFi bridge. Through this, the current WiFI network can be shared with other devices. This is very useful in a scenario where you have access to WiFi on only one device, but need the access for other devices too. Do remember, this feature on the Honor 7X is a battery guzzler., , Overall, the UI is fairly fluid and if you have used an Honor phone in the past, you will feel right at home. There are times when the UI stuttered during heavy multitasking and a few times when Facebook didn’t respond, but apart from that, the average user shouldn’t face any issues., Performance, Let’s talk about the call performance. The audio is crisp and clear at both ends. The earpiece is loud and there is audio leaking when it is at full volume. So, if you are in a car and the earpiece is at full volume, the person sitting next to you can easily eavesdrop on the conversation. At about 60% volume, the earpiece works perfectly well. There are also some places in my house where the network is an issue but the Honor 7X managed to grab better cellular reception than other phones in this case. , Running everyday apps like Facebook, Whatsapp, YouTube, Netflix, and more is a breeze. The smartphone multitasks well and stutters only when you run heavy apps and games back to back. , The biggest downside to the performance of the smartphone was gaming. Casual games like Farm Hero Saga ran well but graphically heavy games like Asphalt 8 showed patchy framerates. When there are a bunch of cars on screen, the framerate really drops. If you are one that wants to play graphically heavy games on the device, you may want to look at other options. , When it comes to benchmarks, the performance is at par with the Honor 9i and this isn’t surprising since both phones are powered by the same SoC. Here is a look at the benchmark scores of the Honor 7X against some competing devices., , Overall, the performance of the device is not groundbreaking, but it has just enough to keep the average user happy. There aren’t any troubling heating issues with the smartphone either., Camera, Moving to the camera, the Honor 7X has a dual camera setup with one 16MP camera and another 2MP camera. Photos clicked in well-lit situations have colours that are true to the source. However, for a phone priced around 15k, there are smartphones with better cameras. Low light photos also present the problem of noise especially when the light is really low. Since the smartphone has a dual camera setup, you’d expect it to click good bokeh photos. However, that isn’t the case. The bokeh photos are average at best and the camera on the Honor 7X isn’t as groundbreaking as they were on the Honor 6X, with respect to their respective competitors. If a camera is of utmost importance to you, you are better off considering the Mi A1., , Below are some of the camera samples (resized for web), , , , , ,  , Battery life, Using the phone for about a week, the smartphone can last you a little more than a 9 to 5 day with above average use. With brightness on auto, and 100% battery at 10am the phone was at about 20% battery when I got home at 8PM, which is good considering usage. We made many calls and sent many texts during the day, clicked some images, watched YouTube videos, Facebooking and some light gaming. The smartphone lasted for about eight and a half hours on the PC Mark Battery Test, which isn’t the best in this category but it isn’t bad either., How it compares, When you consider a 15K smartphone, you will look at devices like the Moto G5 Plus and the Mi A1 to name a few. The Honor 7x has a better display than the Mi A1, which means that you can enjoy movies on it a lot more. The 18:9 display also helps in this regard. However, the output from the speaker of the Mi A1 is far superior. When it comes to everyday performance, the phone is snappy and can give the Mi A1 a run for its money. Gaming performance on the Honor 7X could have been better., Bottom Line, For Rs 13,000 device, the Honor 7X isn’t the best option out there. It has a great display and good battery life and the overall performance is average at best. It loses out to the Mi A1 as far as the camera is concerned and graphically heavy games like Asphalt 8 stutter on the device. You can consider it if you aren’t a heavy smartphone user and like reading content or watching movies on the go, as the display on the smartphone is indeed good. But if the camera is something you are finicky about and aren't a fan of skinned OSes, then you may want to consider your options."

While the phone does look good because of the colour treatment, the presence of too much plastic might put people off, but it really should not. The performance, at least on paper, is almost as good as that of the Redmi Note 6 Pro, but the latter is visibly more responsive across the board. It’s fine if you’re not much of a heavy user, as the battery life is particularly good on this phone., , Honor’s journey in India in 2018 so far has been pretty magical. After staying in the shadows of the likes of Xiaomi and Samsung all this time, the Huawei-owned sub-brand managed to carve out a niche of its own primarily through innovation in the design. It’s easy to spot an Honor phone amidst a host of other metal-bodied phones. Huawei, and subsequently Honor’s experiments with colour treatments, along with packing some impressive hardware has managed to bolster the brand to register a stupendous growth of 281 percent in 2018, according to IDC’s report of smartphone shipments in Q2 2018., Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Huawei Honor 10 Lite Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, Part of the reason for the company’s growth is the onslaught of smartphones with small differences in feature and hardware. More recently, the company announced the Honor 8X powered by the Kirin 710, sporting the largest display in it’s price segment and now, Honor quickly followed it up with the Honor 8C, priced just below the former. The Honor 8C also marks the debut of the Qualcomm Snapdragon 632. With the Snapdragon 625 now looking ancient, the Snapdragon 632 is meant to be the go-to chipset for affordable mid-rangers. With a new chipset under the hood, and priced just shy of the Honor 8X at Rs 12,999, does the Honor 8C offer everything you need from a smartphone? Let’s find out., Honor 8C

TPU case, The Honor 8C takes after the Honor 8X and other Honor phones launched this year with their gradient colour design. While it’s not as blingy as the Honor 9N launched earlier, the Honor 8C is made to be more durable. It switched from glass to polycarbonate but maintained the shaded colour treatment. Honor calls it ‘Cat’s Eye’ design as the aurora blue variant forms shapes seen in cat’s eye when reflected against light. It’s easily one of the best looking phones in its price range, and will compete against the Realme U1 in terms of the design., While polycarbonate is indeed more durable than a glass body, it’s quite prone to scratches and bends. It does seem like the Honor 8C has no flex and is actually quite sturdy, but for safety’s sake, it’s advisable to slap a case on it. The phone also feels quite light despite packing a large battery, but it’s tad too tall to use it one-handed., , 'Cat's Eye' is what Honor calls this design, The front is all screen. Like in all Honor phones launched this year, this too has a notch on top, but it’s not as invasive as say the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro. There are some space on both sides of the notch to display notifications and status bar icons. The Honor 8C’s display has only 720x1520 pixels. In the face of the Realme U1 and even the Honor 8X, it’s clearly underwhelming. The brightness levels, though are thankfully higher than that of the Realme U1, and as a result, it’s a little more legible outdoors., , Watching movies or reading an article, on the other hand is good enough. However, if you like to stream from Netflix or Amazon Prime, you will be disappointed at the lack of Widevine L1 certification which means it cannot stream from these services in fullHD., Honor advertised that the display has an eye-comfort mode that is TuV Rheinland certified, meaning that the blue-light filter is certified to be protective for your eyes. Turning it on while reading something at night will, on paper, give you a better sleep, but since I have messed up sleeping hours anyway, it didn’t really make much of a difference save for putting a warm yellow tint over the panel., , 720p resolution but bright enough for outdoors, The display’s colour temperature is on the cooler side by default, and Honor does offer the option to change the colour temperature. There’s also the option to hide the notch and you will have to manually select the apps you want the notch to be hidden for, which is a bummer. I particularly like the way OnePlus tunes the most popular app to either make space for the notch, or hide it completely. Considering how Honor hoots so much about AI in their smartphones, automatic adaption could have been one feature I would have liked to see., , And then there's the notch, Overall, the Honor 8C feels good in the hand despite having a plastic body, and the display, while not the best, is just about functional., The Snapdragon 632 that powers the Honor 8C is something we had looked forward to using ever since it was announced. Replacing the Snapdragon 625, we were expecting the chipset to offer some serious upgrades. Comparing against the Snapdragon 625-powered Redmi Y2, it does offer a big boost in synthetic benchmark scores. In more ways than one though, the Snapdragon 632 is quite similar to the Snapdragon 636 that powers the Redmi Note 6 Pro. The one on the Honor 8C uses eight Kryo 250 cores based on four semi-custom Cortex-A73 cores and four semi-custom Cortex-A53 cores, and manufactured on a 14nm FinFET process. That’s the same as the Kryo 260 on the Snapdragon 636. Only, on this one the L2 cache is slightly lesser and the max clock speed is only up to 1.8GHz. It also uses an older Adreno 506 GPU as compared to the Adreno 509 on the Snapdragon 636. As a result, while the Honor 8C is definitely more powerful than the most powerful budget phone, the hardware specs reveal that it’s slightly underpowered compared to the Snapdragon 636-powered mid-rangers. Needless to say, it doesn’t come close to the performance of the Snapdragon 660 that’s in the Realme 2 Pro, priced just Rs 1,000 more., , , Nevertheless, the Honor 8C offers good enough performance for the price. On AnTuTu, the Honor 8C scored 103144 against Redmi Note 6 Pro’s 116046, indicating it’s only slightly less underpowered than the Snapdragon 632. Even on Geekbench 4 Single and Multi core tests, the difference isn’t as much. The Honor 8C scored 1269 and 4723 respectively while the Redmi Note 6 Pro scored 1332 and 4861 respectively. The Realme U1 powered by the MediaTek P70 seems to be a better option out of the three with the phone acing every test in our reportoire save for that for graphics processing., While using the Honor 8C as a daily driver, it’s easy to see where the phone falters. It’s perfectly adept at doing the basic stuff — Social media browsing, phone calls, quick replies to texts and the likes. However, it isn’t the best when it comes to multi-tasking. There’s a significant delay in app switching when you double tap the recent key. There are also stutters while scrolling in apps like Facebook. In gaming, the phone leverages Huawei’s GPU Turbo to improve gameplay in certain games like PubG Mobile. PubG Mobile itself ran on medium graphics but with no visible drop in frame rates. The notch doesn’t hide itself automatically while playing a game and you have to manually turn it off by whitelisting the game., The Honor 8C runs on EMUI 8.2 based on Android Oreo 8.1. The new version of EMUI, while not the most aesthetically pleasing, does bring a lot of useful features. It has Huawei’s gesture-based navigation which isn’t all that intuitive and copies the iPhone blatantly. I particularly liked EMUI’s detailed battery usage panel. It breaks down battery usage in the form of hardware and software, and for each app, you can see how much CPU, RAM and battery has been used apart from how long it has been running and how much data it has consumed. Such granular metrics are useful for enthusiasts who like to keep an eye on their usage., Honor didn’t say when the Honor 8C will receive an update to Android 9 Pie, but we hope it comes soon considering the Mate 20 Pro already ships with EMUI 9 based on the latest version of Android., , First Honor phone at this price range to rock the AI Camera moniker, but we wish it made a difference, Honor’s likes to highlight the rear camera on its phone a lot, and even on the Honor 8C, the focus is largely on the cameras that are blessed with AI capabilities. It’s actually the first time an Honor phone worth Rs 11,999 is sporting the AI camera moniker. It turns out the moniker is more of a marketing gimmick than anything useful. The Honor 8C makes use of a 13+2MP rear camera setup. The primary lens has an aperture of f/1.8 along with PDAF while the secondary camera is used for depth calculation. On the front is another 8MP shooter with f/2.0 aperture. Both the front and the back camera can shoot portrait shots., Daylight, , Shutter speed: 1/816s, ISO - 100, , Shutter speed: 1/520s ISO -100, The Honor 8C manages to take decent images in the day. While the photos do look good on the phone’s display, looking at it in a larger screen shows the weaknesses. Landscape shots lack the crisp sharpness we have seen in some Redmi phones in that price range, and the dynamic range in the final JPEG result also isn’t all that wide. There’s minimal details in the shadows and if you try to bring them out in post-production the image becomes unusable with a lot of noise. Colours come out pretty good though. The blues in the sky and the greens in trees are tuned to come out more saturated, making the final result look a little better. The AI mode, in this case, recognizes the      pretty fast but it didn’t appear to do anything significantly different or for that matter, better., Indoors, , Shutter Speed: 1/100 ISO: 113
 , , Shutter Speed: 1/25, ISO: 440, Moving indoors, the camera performs well enough when there’s enough light. Closeup shots of object have the required sharpness to bring out the minute details. It also captures enough light thanks to a wider aperture, and we didn’t notice any significant amount of noise especially in indoor photos shot in the evening under fluorescent light., Low light, , Shutter Speed: 1/25, ISO: 772, Despite a wider aperture, the camera fails to take good low-light shots. It’s also wrong to expect good low-light performance in this price range, but in case of the Honor 8C, the amount of noise in the photos is too high to be considered even for social media. There’s also a painting-like effect in the photos with the edges of objects appearing smudged. Clearly, this isn’t the best camera for low-light shots., Portrait Mode, , Shutter Speed: 1/25s, ISO: 510, Honor has been offering the portrait mode in almost all its phones, and while the consistency is better on more expensive phones, the portrait mode on budget phones aren’t so good. The blurring in the background appears to be quite artificial, almost as if like the object was cut and pasted in the background. Faces are processed a little better with clear distinction between the edges and the background., Selfies, , Selfie with flash on (Shutter Speed: 1/10, ISO 3475), , Selfie with flash off (Shutter Speed: 1/10, ISO 4150), The 8MP sensor up front is paired with a selfie flash that Honor claims improves selfies in low-light. However, in our tests, the flash only made increased the highlights in the skin, making the skin glow unnaturally, losing out on all the granular details., , Honor's camera UI takes some time getting used to, The camera also offers various modes like AR Lens that is basically a cheap gimmick where your face is superimposed against a particular background. The application is anything but good and it’s better to simply avoid this mode., , The Honor 8C packs a big 4,000mAh battery that is one of the good things about the phone. The 4,000mAh battery is well-optimised to deliver one and a half days worth of charge easily. We got around 8 hours 20 minutes of usage on PCMark’s Work 2.0 Battery test which should convert to two days of usage if you are using the phone moderately. Gaming drains the battery quickly though. One session of PubG (30-35 minutes) drained the battery from 65 percent to 51 percent. You should hope the battery lasts long enough so that you can plug in the phone when you’re going to bed, as the phone doesn’t support fast charging. It takes around 2-2.5 hours to fully top up the phone., The Honor 8C is a good phone to consider if you’re not much of a power user. While the phone does look good because of the colour treatment, the presence of too much plastic might put people off, but it really should not. The performance, at least on paper, is almost as good as that of the Redmi Note 6 Pro, but the latter is visibly more responsive across the board. It’s fine if you’re not much of a heavy user, as the battery life is particularly good on this phone."

Even on Geekbench 4 Single and Multi core tests, the difference isn’t as much. The Honor 8C scored 1269 and 4723 respectively while the Redmi Note 6 Pro scored 1332 and 4861 respectively. The Realme U1 powered by the MediaTek P70 seems to be a better option out of the three with the phone acing every test in our reportoire save for that for graphics processing., While using the Honor 8C as a daily driver, it’s easy to see where the phone falters. It’s perfectly adept at doing the basic stuff — Social media browsing, phone calls, quick replies to texts and the likes. However, it isn’t the best when it comes to multi-tasking. There’s a significant delay in app switching when you double tap the recent key. There are also stutters while scrolling in apps like Facebook. In gaming, the phone leverages Huawei’s GPU Turbo to improve gameplay in certain games like PubG Mobile. PubG Mobile itself ran on medium graphics but with no visible drop in frame rates. The notch doesn’t hide itself automatically while playing a game and you have to manually turn it off by whitelisting the game., The Honor 8C runs on EMUI 8.2 based on Android Oreo 8.1. The new version of EMUI, while not the most aesthetically pleasing, does bring a lot of useful features. It has Huawei’s gesture-based navigation which isn’t all that intuitive and copies the iPhone blatantly. I particularly liked EMUI’s detailed battery usage panel. It breaks down battery usage in the form of hardware and software, and for each app, you can see how much CPU, RAM and battery has been used apart from how long it has been running and how much data it has consumed. Such granular metrics are useful for enthusiasts who like to keep an eye on their usage., Honor didn’t say when the Honor 8C will receive an update to Android 9 Pie, but we hope it comes soon considering the Mate 20 Pro already ships with EMUI 9 based on the latest version of Android., , First Honor phone at this price range to rock the AI Camera moniker, but we wish it made a difference, Honor’s likes to highlight the rear camera on its phone a lot, and even on the Honor 8C, the focus is largely on the cameras that are blessed with AI capabilities. It’s actually the first time an Honor phone worth Rs 11,999 is sporting the AI camera moniker. It turns out the moniker is more of a marketing gimmick than anything useful. The Honor 8C makes use of a 13+2MP rear camera setup. The primary lens has an aperture of f/1.8 along with PDAF while the secondary camera is used for depth calculation. On the front is another 8MP shooter with f/2.0 aperture. Both the front and the back camera can shoot portrait shots., Daylight, , Shutter speed: 1/816s, ISO - 100, , Shutter speed: 1/520s ISO -100, The Honor 8C manages to take decent images in the day. While the photos do look good on the phone’s display, looking at it in a larger screen shows the weaknesses. Landscape shots lack the crisp sharpness we have seen in some Redmi phones in that price range, and the dynamic range in the final JPEG result also isn’t all that wide. There’s minimal details in the shadows and if you try to bring them out in post-production the image becomes unusable with a lot of noise. Colours come out pretty good though. The blues in the sky and the greens in trees are tuned to come out more saturated, making the final result look a little better. The AI mode, in this case, recognizes the      pretty fast but it didn’t appear to do anything significantly different or for that matter, better., Indoors, , Shutter Speed: 1/100 ISO: 113
 , , Shutter Speed: 1/25, ISO: 440, Moving indoors, the camera performs well enough when there’s enough light. Closeup shots of object have the required sharpness to bring out the minute details. It also captures enough light thanks to a wider aperture, and we didn’t notice any significant amount of noise especially in indoor photos shot in the evening under fluorescent light., Low light, , Shutter Speed: 1/25, ISO: 772, Despite a wider aperture, the camera fails to take good low-light shots. It’s also wrong to expect good low-light performance in this price range, but in case of the Honor 8C, the amount of noise in the photos is too high to be considered even for social media. There’s also a painting-like effect in the photos with the edges of objects appearing smudged. Clearly, this isn’t the best camera for low-light shots., Portrait Mode, , Shutter Speed: 1/25s, ISO: 510, Honor has been offering the portrait mode in almost all its phones, and while the consistency is better on more expensive phones, the portrait mode on budget phones aren’t so good. The blurring in the background appears to be quite artificial, almost as if like the object was cut and pasted in the background. Faces are processed a little better with clear distinction between the edges and the background., Selfies, , Selfie with flash on (Shutter Speed: 1/10, ISO 3475), , Selfie with flash off (Shutter Speed: 1/10, ISO 4150), The 8MP sensor up front is paired with a selfie flash that Honor claims improves selfies in low-light. However, in our tests, the flash only made increased the highlights in the skin, making the skin glow unnaturally, losing out on all the granular details., , Honor's camera UI takes some time getting used to, The camera also offers various modes like AR Lens that is basically a cheap gimmick where your face is superimposed against a particular background. The application is anything but good and it’s better to simply avoid this mode., , The Honor 8C packs a big 4,000mAh battery that is one of the good things about the phone. The 4,000mAh battery is well-optimised to deliver one and a half days worth of charge easily. We got around 8 hours 20 minutes of usage on PCMark’s Work 2.0 Battery test which should convert to two days of usage if you are using the phone moderately. Gaming drains the battery quickly though. One session of PubG (30-35 minutes) drained the battery from 65 percent to 51 percent. You should hope the battery lasts long enough so that you can plug in the phone when you’re going to bed, as the phone doesn’t support fast charging. It takes around 2-2.5 hours to fully top up the phone., The Honor 8C is a good phone to consider if you’re not much of a power user. While the phone does look good because of the colour treatment, the presence of too much plastic might put people off, but it really should not. The performance, at least on paper, is almost as good as that of the Redmi Note 6 Pro, but the latter is visibly more responsive across the board. It’s fine if you’re not much of a heavy user, as the battery life is particularly good on this phone."
2281,42,huawei-honor-8x-review-172025,0,0,2019-05-22,172025,Subhrojit Mallick,Honor 8x Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/huawei-honor-8x-review-172025.html,"The Honor 8X is a big-screen phone with an affordable price tag. It’s a good experience to watch videos on it, play games, but the phone itself is quite unwieldy. It’s glossy design and generous amounts of glass might did put me off, but it’s up to you, the buyer, to decide whether you want something that looks good but is quite delicate at the same time. The performance in general is quite commendable but the UI, like all Honor and Huawei phones aren’t the best, aesthetically speaking. As for the camera, it can take decent photos in daylight, but expecting a good low-light performance from it is a bit too much., , The Honor 8X is a testament to Huawei and its sub-brand Honor’s aggressive growth in India. It’s clear that Xiaomi is no longer the king of the mid-range segment and others, including Honor, Nokia, Realme and the likes can compete shoulder-to-shoulder. If the first half saw the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro rivalled fiercely by the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1, the Honor 8X fills the void in the second half of the year. At Rs 14,999, it’s a slab of glass that not only looks good, but also performs almost as well as its rivals. The Honor 8X introduces a new mid-range Kirin SoC in the sub-15k but does it offer better value-for-money than its rivals? Let’s find out, Huawei Honor 8C 64GB Review, Huawei Honor 10 Lite Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, , One look at the Honor 8X and you can tell it’s made by Huawei or Honor. It has the signature glass design with gradient colours, although this time, Honor attempted a dual-tone finish. One-fourth of the rear panel has a lighter shade of blue while the rest of the back is shiny dark blue. To be honest, I thought it was a manufacturing defect when I picked it up. The colours do shift when you change the angles but the distinction is very clear. The panel on the back is glossy, smudge prone and has a uniform texture despite using two colours. The effect has been hailed by others as good, and I might be one of the minority to not like what Honor has done with the 8X. You do get a TPU case bundled in the box which will offer some protection to the glass back. The fingerprint sensor dips lower in the body and is easy to find while holding the phone upright. The Honor logo and the camera information are all written in landscape mode, indicating that it’s meant to be used in that orientation, like how it is on the Huawei P20 Pro (review)., Turn it around and the screen takes precedence. The Honor 8X perhaps has the largest display in the sub-15K price segment. It’s significantly wide and cannot be used by just one hand. The panel also takes up most of the real estate up front with a 91 percent screen-to-body ratio. The bottom chin has been shaved off even more making the screen-to-body ratio one of the highlights of the phone., Despite a glass body, the phone is built quite sturdy. The aluminium frame housing the glass panels on both sides feel strong and there’s no flex whatsoever. The corners are also rounded off to offer a better grip. By default the screen also adapts to the rounded corners, but if you choose to hide the notch, the symmetry gets messed up completely. The camera on the back juts out of the body with sharp edges. If you carry a second device in the same pocket as this phone, there’s a chance the camera bump would scratch the other device., , The Honor 8X’s panel is a massive chunk of glass. Sitting at 6.5-inches measured diagonally, it’s much more than what the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Realme 2 Pro offer. The larger screen size is abetted by the notch on top of course, which incidentally isn’t all that big (not Pixel 3 XL-like big, I mean) and a smaller chin. It may be 7.8mm thin, but the width of the display means it’s almost impossible to use with just one hand. The elements on the screen; Icons, texts, images, and the likes all appear quite large. As a result, you’re essentially reading the same amount of text you’d read in a smaller 6-inch panel, unless you decide to shrink the size of the text. Also, it’s easy to register accidental touches while trying to reach to the other end of the panel., , The 6.5-inch IPS LCD panel itself is quite bright and vibrant and was easily legible under direct sunlight. By default, the panel uses a vivid colour mode that ups the contrast and saturation to a great extent making content appear richer than it actually is. It’s problematic if you’re planning to edit photos or videos in your phone, but watching content from Netflix and YouTube is a good enough experience. The extra screen real estate also makes things more immersive. It’s also a good display to play games like PubG Mobile on, where a bigger screen gives an advantage., , A big-screen phone demands stable and fast performance and the Honor 8X relies on a HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC for that. It’s coupled with up to 6GB RAM and up to 128GB storage. The unit we received for review has 4GB RAM and 64GB storage though, and considering it performs well enough in this configuration, the higher variant will only be better, if not the same. It’s also the first time Honor has used the Kirin 710 SoC in a mid-range phone and could be an indication that it’s finally retiring the aged Kirin 659. The Kirin 710 is a 12nm based chipset with an octa-core configuration. The performance cores can go all the way up to 2.2GHz which is a little higher than what the Snapdragon 660 can clock. Benchmark reports take this into account. Honor also offers a dedicated slot to expand storage which is much welcome. Thankfully, it is a standard MicroSD card slot and not a propreiatry Nano memory card slot like the one on the recently announced Huawei Mate 20 Pro (first impressions)., , , On AnTuTu 6.0, the Honor 8X scored 139785 which is higher than the Snapdragon 660-powered Realme 2 Pro’s 128430, while on Geekbench Single and Multi core tests, the Honor 8X scored 1602 and 5435 respectively, which is again significantly higher than what the Snapdragon 660 smartphones score. On 3DMark’s Slingshot test, the Honor 8X scored 1437, which is the only place where the Kirin 710 falls behind as compared to the Snapdragon 660. It’s a clear indication that Huawei’s new chipset is quite ahead of Qualcomm’s top-of-the-line mid-range chip in the market right now. But does it lead to a boost in performance?, The Honor 8X works perfectly fine — Smooth transitions, relatively quicker app launches, and negligible stutter while scrolling in apps like Facebook that continuously process data as you scroll down the timeline. Multi-tasking is also good enough although EMUI’s aggressive RAM management tends to kill apps that are active in the background. Essentially, if you have minimised Amazon Prime Video to reply to a message on Facebook, and then go back to watching, you’ll have to start from the main screen which is a bummer., As for gaming, the benchmark did suggest the GPU on the Kirin 710 isn’t really as good as what Qualcomm offers in the Snapdragon 660, but Honor leverages the GPU Turbo technology to improve gameplay. However, GPU Turbo is only restricted to selected games. Thankfully, that includes PubG Mobile which is what most people are playing these days. It runs on medium settings but the frame rate is stable enough with minimal lag., , The Honor 8X may be a good looking smartphone from the outside, but EMUI 8.2 on the inside takes away from the beauty. The Android 8.1-based UI has large icons which aren’t aesthetically pleasing. It comes running the September 2018 security patch which is a sign of good things. Honor did promise the phone will be updated to Android 9 Pie but they didn’t share a timeline. There’s also NFC and Face Unlock (it’s a bit slower than the physical sensor and not that secure) as well. The Honor 8X comes preloaded with apps like Netflix, Messenger, Instagram, Facebook and more. It depends on your usage whether you’ll call it bloatware, but they can all be uninstalled. The phone also supports gesture-based navigation that seems to be a rip-off of iOS’ gestures, but aren’t as intuitive. It has a steep learning curve and when the gesture navigation is turned on, the keyboard shifts down towards the bottom of the display and that leads to a lot of typos., The software has a smart booster to free up RAM and clean junk files, a gaming mode to free up resources for games, and a bunch of Honor-centric apps that unfortunately cannot be uninstalled., , Honor’s cameras have proven to be the highlight of their product. They are adequately blessed with AI capabilities that, depending on where you stand, can augment or ruin the photos the phone takes. It’s the same for the Honor 8X. There is a 20MP camera with f/1.8 aperture combined with a 2MP depth sensor. The camera on the back is capable of taking AI-enabled portrait shots where you can vary the depth of field in real-time. Up front is a 16 MP f/2.0 sensor which can take selfies with portrait lighting effects., The camera quality isn’t much to write home about. It’s what we have seen in other Honor and Huawei phones in that price range over this year. Oversaturated colours, high contrasts and overall a photo that looks very artificial. Turning the AI mode on recognises what you’re shooting (plants, sunsets, buildings, etc.) and applies an additional layer of saturation on it., Daylight, , The Honor 8X, like most phones in the mid-range segment, can take good photos when there’s ample light. The samples we shot for the phone aren’t really the best considering how Delhi gets shrouded under a thick blanket of smog during this time, but based on what we saw, it’s likely to deliver decent results. The white balance is slightly off the mark though with a tendency to use a warmer white balance in photos shot during the day, that is if you have the AI mode turned on. The shadow regions also lose out on the details and the camera takes a slightly longer time to focus. Frankly, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro seems to do a better job at taking photos. If you’re considering to buy the 6GB variant, you can also look at the Mi A2 which has a fantastic camera., Indoors, , When indoors, the camera tends to prefer the source of light for metering, making the frame darker. The AI mode here tries to recover details and manages to do that just barely well enough. When exposing for things away from the source of light though, the Honor 8X does light up the scene but the source of light is blown out., Lowlight, , Moving on to low-light, this is where the camera struggles. Keeping the AI mode turned on will let the camera recognise you’re shooting a low-light shot and it’ll effectively attempt to brighten up the scene. In the end, it just bumps up the ISO and slows down the shutter speed without taking care of the stabilisation. You have to keep the phone pointed at the scene for longer and a slight shake ruins the photos., Battery, , The Honor 8X has a rather large 3,750mAh battery. But when you take the large 6.5-inch panel into account, the battery doesn’t seem to be all that big. Nevertheless, it got us through the day easily. We’re yet to run the PCMark Work 2.0 test on it and will update this review once the results are in. But it seems like the battery is just about enough to last the day if you are a medium to heavy user. Playing games like PubG though will drain the battery much faster and you’ll have to plug it in by around 7PM in the evening., The phone charges using a microUSB port and a bundled 10W charger which tops up the battery in around an hour and a half., The Honor 8X is a big-screen phone with an affordable price tag. It’s a good experience to watch videos on it, play games, but the phone itself is quite unwieldy. It’s glossy design and generous amounts of glass might did put me off, but it’s up to you, the buyer, to decide whether you want something that looks good but is quite delicate at the same time. The performance in general is quite commendable but the UI, like all Honor and Huawei phones aren’t the best, aesthetically speaking.

It’s glossy design and generous amounts of glass might did put me off, but it’s up to you, the buyer, to decide whether you want something that looks good but is quite delicate at the same time. The performance in general is quite commendable but the UI, like all Honor and Huawei phones aren’t the best, aesthetically speaking. As for the camera, it can take decent photos in daylight, but expecting a good low-light performance from it is a bit too much., , The Honor 8X is a testament to Huawei and its sub-brand Honor’s aggressive growth in India. It’s clear that Xiaomi is no longer the king of the mid-range segment and others, including Honor, Nokia, Realme and the likes can compete shoulder-to-shoulder. If the first half saw the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro rivalled fiercely by the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1, the Honor 8X fills the void in the second half of the year. At Rs 14,999, it’s a slab of glass that not only looks good, but also performs almost as well as its rivals. The Honor 8X introduces a new mid-range Kirin SoC in the sub-15k but does it offer better value-for-money than its rivals? Let’s find out, Huawei Honor 8C 64GB Review, Huawei Honor 10 Lite Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, , One look at the Honor 8X and you can tell it’s made by Huawei or Honor. It has the signature glass design with gradient colours, although this time, Honor attempted a dual-tone finish. One-fourth of the rear panel has a lighter shade of blue while the rest of the back is shiny dark blue. To be honest, I thought it was a manufacturing defect when I picked it up. The colours do shift when you change the angles but the distinction is very clear. The panel on the back is glossy, smudge prone and has a uniform texture despite using two colours. The effect has been hailed by others as good, and I might be one of the minority to not like what Honor has done with the 8X. You do get a TPU case bundled in the box which will offer some protection to the glass back. The fingerprint sensor dips lower in the body and is easy to find while holding the phone upright. The Honor logo and the camera information are all written in landscape mode, indicating that it’s meant to be used in that orientation, like how it is on the Huawei P20 Pro (review)., Turn it around and the screen takes precedence. The Honor 8X perhaps has the largest display in the sub-15K price segment. It’s significantly wide and cannot be used by just one hand. The panel also takes up most of the real estate up front with a 91 percent screen-to-body ratio. The bottom chin has been shaved off even more making the screen-to-body ratio one of the highlights of the phone., Despite a glass body, the phone is built quite sturdy. The aluminium frame housing the glass panels on both sides feel strong and there’s no flex whatsoever. The corners are also rounded off to offer a better grip. By default the screen also adapts to the rounded corners, but if you choose to hide the notch, the symmetry gets messed up completely. The camera on the back juts out of the body with sharp edges. If you carry a second device in the same pocket as this phone, there’s a chance the camera bump would scratch the other device., , The Honor 8X’s panel is a massive chunk of glass. Sitting at 6.5-inches measured diagonally, it’s much more than what the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Realme 2 Pro offer. The larger screen size is abetted by the notch on top of course, which incidentally isn’t all that big (not Pixel 3 XL-like big, I mean) and a smaller chin. It may be 7.8mm thin, but the width of the display means it’s almost impossible to use with just one hand. The elements on the screen; Icons, texts, images, and the likes all appear quite large. As a result, you’re essentially reading the same amount of text you’d read in a smaller 6-inch panel, unless you decide to shrink the size of the text. Also, it’s easy to register accidental touches while trying to reach to the other end of the panel., , The 6.5-inch IPS LCD panel itself is quite bright and vibrant and was easily legible under direct sunlight. By default, the panel uses a vivid colour mode that ups the contrast and saturation to a great extent making content appear richer than it actually is. It’s problematic if you’re planning to edit photos or videos in your phone, but watching content from Netflix and YouTube is a good enough experience. The extra screen real estate also makes things more immersive. It’s also a good display to play games like PubG Mobile on, where a bigger screen gives an advantage., , A big-screen phone demands stable and fast performance and the Honor 8X relies on a HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC for that. It’s coupled with up to 6GB RAM and up to 128GB storage. The unit we received for review has 4GB RAM and 64GB storage though, and considering it performs well enough in this configuration, the higher variant will only be better, if not the same. It’s also the first time Honor has used the Kirin 710 SoC in a mid-range phone and could be an indication that it’s finally retiring the aged Kirin 659. The Kirin 710 is a 12nm based chipset with an octa-core configuration. The performance cores can go all the way up to 2.2GHz which is a little higher than what the Snapdragon 660 can clock. Benchmark reports take this into account. Honor also offers a dedicated slot to expand storage which is much welcome. Thankfully, it is a standard MicroSD card slot and not a propreiatry Nano memory card slot like the one on the recently announced Huawei Mate 20 Pro (first impressions)., , , On AnTuTu 6.0, the Honor 8X scored 139785 which is higher than the Snapdragon 660-powered Realme 2 Pro’s 128430, while on Geekbench Single and Multi core tests, the Honor 8X scored 1602 and 5435 respectively, which is again significantly higher than what the Snapdragon 660 smartphones score. On 3DMark’s Slingshot test, the Honor 8X scored 1437, which is the only place where the Kirin 710 falls behind as compared to the Snapdragon 660. It’s a clear indication that Huawei’s new chipset is quite ahead of Qualcomm’s top-of-the-line mid-range chip in the market right now. But does it lead to a boost in performance?, The Honor 8X works perfectly fine — Smooth transitions, relatively quicker app launches, and negligible stutter while scrolling in apps like Facebook that continuously process data as you scroll down the timeline. Multi-tasking is also good enough although EMUI’s aggressive RAM management tends to kill apps that are active in the background. Essentially, if you have minimised Amazon Prime Video to reply to a message on Facebook, and then go back to watching, you’ll have to start from the main screen which is a bummer., As for gaming, the benchmark did suggest the GPU on the Kirin 710 isn’t really as good as what Qualcomm offers in the Snapdragon 660, but Honor leverages the GPU Turbo technology to improve gameplay. However, GPU Turbo is only restricted to selected games. Thankfully, that includes PubG Mobile which is what most people are playing these days. It runs on medium settings but the frame rate is stable enough with minimal lag., , The Honor 8X may be a good looking smartphone from the outside, but EMUI 8.2 on the inside takes away from the beauty. The Android 8.1-based UI has large icons which aren’t aesthetically pleasing. It comes running the September 2018 security patch which is a sign of good things. Honor did promise the phone will be updated to Android 9 Pie but they didn’t share a timeline. There’s also NFC and Face Unlock (it’s a bit slower than the physical sensor and not that secure) as well. The Honor 8X comes preloaded with apps like Netflix, Messenger, Instagram, Facebook and more. It depends on your usage whether you’ll call it bloatware, but they can all be uninstalled. The phone also supports gesture-based navigation that seems to be a rip-off of iOS’ gestures, but aren’t as intuitive. It has a steep learning curve and when the gesture navigation is turned on, the keyboard shifts down towards the bottom of the display and that leads to a lot of typos., The software has a smart booster to free up RAM and clean junk files, a gaming mode to free up resources for games, and a bunch of Honor-centric apps that unfortunately cannot be uninstalled., , Honor’s cameras have proven to be the highlight of their product. They are adequately blessed with AI capabilities that, depending on where you stand, can augment or ruin the photos the phone takes. It’s the same for the Honor 8X. There is a 20MP camera with f/1.8 aperture combined with a 2MP depth sensor. The camera on the back is capable of taking AI-enabled portrait shots where you can vary the depth of field in real-time. Up front is a 16 MP f/2.0 sensor which can take selfies with portrait lighting effects., The camera quality isn’t much to write home about. It’s what we have seen in other Honor and Huawei phones in that price range over this year. Oversaturated colours, high contrasts and overall a photo that looks very artificial. Turning the AI mode on recognises what you’re shooting (plants, sunsets, buildings, etc.) and applies an additional layer of saturation on it., Daylight, , The Honor 8X, like most phones in the mid-range segment, can take good photos when there’s ample light. The samples we shot for the phone aren’t really the best considering how Delhi gets shrouded under a thick blanket of smog during this time, but based on what we saw, it’s likely to deliver decent results. The white balance is slightly off the mark though with a tendency to use a warmer white balance in photos shot during the day, that is if you have the AI mode turned on. The shadow regions also lose out on the details and the camera takes a slightly longer time to focus. Frankly, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro seems to do a better job at taking photos. If you’re considering to buy the 6GB variant, you can also look at the Mi A2 which has a fantastic camera., Indoors, , When indoors, the camera tends to prefer the source of light for metering, making the frame darker. The AI mode here tries to recover details and manages to do that just barely well enough. When exposing for things away from the source of light though, the Honor 8X does light up the scene but the source of light is blown out., Lowlight, , Moving on to low-light, this is where the camera struggles. Keeping the AI mode turned on will let the camera recognise you’re shooting a low-light shot and it’ll effectively attempt to brighten up the scene. In the end, it just bumps up the ISO and slows down the shutter speed without taking care of the stabilisation. You have to keep the phone pointed at the scene for longer and a slight shake ruins the photos., Battery, , The Honor 8X has a rather large 3,750mAh battery. But when you take the large 6.5-inch panel into account, the battery doesn’t seem to be all that big. Nevertheless, it got us through the day easily. We’re yet to run the PCMark Work 2.0 test on it and will update this review once the results are in. But it seems like the battery is just about enough to last the day if you are a medium to heavy user. Playing games like PubG though will drain the battery much faster and you’ll have to plug it in by around 7PM in the evening., The phone charges using a microUSB port and a bundled 10W charger which tops up the battery in around an hour and a half., The Honor 8X is a big-screen phone with an affordable price tag. It’s a good experience to watch videos on it, play games, but the phone itself is quite unwieldy. It’s glossy design and generous amounts of glass might did put me off, but it’s up to you, the buyer, to decide whether you want something that looks good but is quite delicate at the same time. The performance in general is quite commendable but the UI, like all Honor and Huawei phones aren’t the best, aesthetically speaking. As for the camera, it can take decent photos in daylight, but expecting a good low-light performance from it is a bit too much."

It runs on medium settings but the frame rate is stable enough with minimal lag., , The Honor 8X may be a good looking smartphone from the outside, but EMUI 8.2 on the inside takes away from the beauty. The Android 8.1-based UI has large icons which aren’t aesthetically pleasing. It comes running the September 2018 security patch which is a sign of good things. Honor did promise the phone will be updated to Android 9 Pie but they didn’t share a timeline. There’s also NFC and Face Unlock (it’s a bit slower than the physical sensor and not that secure) as well. The Honor 8X comes preloaded with apps like Netflix, Messenger, Instagram, Facebook and more. It depends on your usage whether you’ll call it bloatware, but they can all be uninstalled. The phone also supports gesture-based navigation that seems to be a rip-off of iOS’ gestures, but aren’t as intuitive. It has a steep learning curve and when the gesture navigation is turned on, the keyboard shifts down towards the bottom of the display and that leads to a lot of typos., The software has a smart booster to free up RAM and clean junk files, a gaming mode to free up resources for games, and a bunch of Honor-centric apps that unfortunately cannot be uninstalled., , Honor’s cameras have proven to be the highlight of their product. They are adequately blessed with AI capabilities that, depending on where you stand, can augment or ruin the photos the phone takes. It’s the same for the Honor 8X. There is a 20MP camera with f/1.8 aperture combined with a 2MP depth sensor. The camera on the back is capable of taking AI-enabled portrait shots where you can vary the depth of field in real-time. Up front is a 16 MP f/2.0 sensor which can take selfies with portrait lighting effects., The camera quality isn’t much to write home about. It’s what we have seen in other Honor and Huawei phones in that price range over this year. Oversaturated colours, high contrasts and overall a photo that looks very artificial. Turning the AI mode on recognises what you’re shooting (plants, sunsets, buildings, etc.) and applies an additional layer of saturation on it., Daylight, , The Honor 8X, like most phones in the mid-range segment, can take good photos when there’s ample light. The samples we shot for the phone aren’t really the best considering how Delhi gets shrouded under a thick blanket of smog during this time, but based on what we saw, it’s likely to deliver decent results. The white balance is slightly off the mark though with a tendency to use a warmer white balance in photos shot during the day, that is if you have the AI mode turned on. The shadow regions also lose out on the details and the camera takes a slightly longer time to focus. Frankly, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro seems to do a better job at taking photos. If you’re considering to buy the 6GB variant, you can also look at the Mi A2 which has a fantastic camera., Indoors, , When indoors, the camera tends to prefer the source of light for metering, making the frame darker. The AI mode here tries to recover details and manages to do that just barely well enough. When exposing for things away from the source of light though, the Honor 8X does light up the scene but the source of light is blown out., Lowlight, , Moving on to low-light, this is where the camera struggles. Keeping the AI mode turned on will let the camera recognise you’re shooting a low-light shot and it’ll effectively attempt to brighten up the scene. In the end, it just bumps up the ISO and slows down the shutter speed without taking care of the stabilisation. You have to keep the phone pointed at the scene for longer and a slight shake ruins the photos., Battery, , The Honor 8X has a rather large 3,750mAh battery. But when you take the large 6.5-inch panel into account, the battery doesn’t seem to be all that big. Nevertheless, it got us through the day easily. We’re yet to run the PCMark Work 2.0 test on it and will update this review once the results are in. But it seems like the battery is just about enough to last the day if you are a medium to heavy user. Playing games like PubG though will drain the battery much faster and you’ll have to plug it in by around 7PM in the evening., The phone charges using a microUSB port and a bundled 10W charger which tops up the battery in around an hour and a half., The Honor 8X is a big-screen phone with an affordable price tag. It’s a good experience to watch videos on it, play games, but the phone itself is quite unwieldy. It’s glossy design and generous amounts of glass might did put me off, but it’s up to you, the buyer, to decide whether you want something that looks good but is quite delicate at the same time. The performance in general is quite commendable but the UI, like all Honor and Huawei phones aren’t the best, aesthetically speaking. As for the camera, it can take decent photos in daylight, but expecting a good low-light performance from it is a bit too much."

It’s a good experience to watch videos on it, play games, but the phone itself is quite unwieldy. It’s glossy design and generous amounts of glass might did put me off, but it’s up to you, the buyer, to decide whether you want something that looks good but is quite delicate at the same time. The performance in general is quite commendable but the UI, like all Honor and Huawei phones aren’t the best, aesthetically speaking. As for the camera, it can take decent photos in daylight, but expecting a good low-light performance from it is a bit too much., , The Honor 8X is a testament to Huawei and its sub-brand Honor’s aggressive growth in India. It’s clear that Xiaomi is no longer the king of the mid-range segment and others, including Honor, Nokia, Realme and the likes can compete shoulder-to-shoulder. If the first half saw the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro rivalled fiercely by the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1, the Honor 8X fills the void in the second half of the year. At Rs 14,999, it’s a slab of glass that not only looks good, but also performs almost as well as its rivals. The Honor 8X introduces a new mid-range Kirin SoC in the sub-15k but does it offer better value-for-money than its rivals? Let’s find out, Huawei Honor 8C 64GB Review, Huawei Honor 10 Lite Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, , One look at the Honor 8X and you can tell it’s made by Huawei or Honor. It has the signature glass design with gradient colours, although this time, Honor attempted a dual-tone finish. One-fourth of the rear panel has a lighter shade of blue while the rest of the back is shiny dark blue. To be honest, I thought it was a manufacturing defect when I picked it up. The colours do shift when you change the angles but the distinction is very clear. The panel on the back is glossy, smudge prone and has a uniform texture despite using two colours. The effect has been hailed by others as good, and I might be one of the minority to not like what Honor has done with the 8X. You do get a TPU case bundled in the box which will offer some protection to the glass back. The fingerprint sensor dips lower in the body and is easy to find while holding the phone upright. The Honor logo and the camera information are all written in landscape mode, indicating that it’s meant to be used in that orientation, like how it is on the Huawei P20 Pro (review)., Turn it around and the screen takes precedence. The Honor 8X perhaps has the largest display in the sub-15K price segment. It’s significantly wide and cannot be used by just one hand. The panel also takes up most of the real estate up front with a 91 percent screen-to-body ratio. The bottom chin has been shaved off even more making the screen-to-body ratio one of the highlights of the phone., Despite a glass body, the phone is built quite sturdy. The aluminium frame housing the glass panels on both sides feel strong and there’s no flex whatsoever. The corners are also rounded off to offer a better grip. By default the screen also adapts to the rounded corners, but if you choose to hide the notch, the symmetry gets messed up completely. The camera on the back juts out of the body with sharp edges. If you carry a second device in the same pocket as this phone, there’s a chance the camera bump would scratch the other device., , The Honor 8X’s panel is a massive chunk of glass. Sitting at 6.5-inches measured diagonally, it’s much more than what the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Realme 2 Pro offer. The larger screen size is abetted by the notch on top of course, which incidentally isn’t all that big (not Pixel 3 XL-like big, I mean) and a smaller chin. It may be 7.8mm thin, but the width of the display means it’s almost impossible to use with just one hand. The elements on the screen; Icons, texts, images, and the likes all appear quite large. As a result, you’re essentially reading the same amount of text you’d read in a smaller 6-inch panel, unless you decide to shrink the size of the text. Also, it’s easy to register accidental touches while trying to reach to the other end of the panel., , The 6.5-inch IPS LCD panel itself is quite bright and vibrant and was easily legible under direct sunlight. By default, the panel uses a vivid colour mode that ups the contrast and saturation to a great extent making content appear richer than it actually is. It’s problematic if you’re planning to edit photos or videos in your phone, but watching content from Netflix and YouTube is a good enough experience. The extra screen real estate also makes things more immersive. It’s also a good display to play games like PubG Mobile on, where a bigger screen gives an advantage., , A big-screen phone demands stable and fast performance and the Honor 8X relies on a HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC for that. It’s coupled with up to 6GB RAM and up to 128GB storage. The unit we received for review has 4GB RAM and 64GB storage though, and considering it performs well enough in this configuration, the higher variant will only be better, if not the same. It’s also the first time Honor has used the Kirin 710 SoC in a mid-range phone and could be an indication that it’s finally retiring the aged Kirin 659. The Kirin 710 is a 12nm based chipset with an octa-core configuration. The performance cores can go all the way up to 2.2GHz which is a little higher than what the Snapdragon 660 can clock. Benchmark reports take this into account. Honor also offers a dedicated slot to expand storage which is much welcome. Thankfully, it is a standard MicroSD card slot and not a propreiatry Nano memory card slot like the one on the recently announced Huawei Mate 20 Pro (first impressions)., , , On AnTuTu 6.0, the Honor 8X scored 139785 which is higher than the Snapdragon 660-powered Realme 2 Pro’s 128430, while on Geekbench Single and Multi core tests, the Honor 8X scored 1602 and 5435 respectively, which is again significantly higher than what the Snapdragon 660 smartphones score. On 3DMark’s Slingshot test, the Honor 8X scored 1437, which is the only place where the Kirin 710 falls behind as compared to the Snapdragon 660. It’s a clear indication that Huawei’s new chipset is quite ahead of Qualcomm’s top-of-the-line mid-range chip in the market right now. But does it lead to a boost in performance?, The Honor 8X works perfectly fine — Smooth transitions, relatively quicker app launches, and negligible stutter while scrolling in apps like Facebook that continuously process data as you scroll down the timeline. Multi-tasking is also good enough although EMUI’s aggressive RAM management tends to kill apps that are active in the background. Essentially, if you have minimised Amazon Prime Video to reply to a message on Facebook, and then go back to watching, you’ll have to start from the main screen which is a bummer., As for gaming, the benchmark did suggest the GPU on the Kirin 710 isn’t really as good as what Qualcomm offers in the Snapdragon 660, but Honor leverages the GPU Turbo technology to improve gameplay. However, GPU Turbo is only restricted to selected games. Thankfully, that includes PubG Mobile which is what most people are playing these days. It runs on medium settings but the frame rate is stable enough with minimal lag., , The Honor 8X may be a good looking smartphone from the outside, but EMUI 8.2 on the inside takes away from the beauty. The Android 8.1-based UI has large icons which aren’t aesthetically pleasing. It comes running the September 2018 security patch which is a sign of good things. Honor did promise the phone will be updated to Android 9 Pie but they didn’t share a timeline. There’s also NFC and Face Unlock (it’s a bit slower than the physical sensor and not that secure) as well. The Honor 8X comes preloaded with apps like Netflix, Messenger, Instagram, Facebook and more. It depends on your usage whether you’ll call it bloatware, but they can all be uninstalled. The phone also supports gesture-based navigation that seems to be a rip-off of iOS’ gestures, but aren’t as intuitive. It has a steep learning curve and when the gesture navigation is turned on, the keyboard shifts down towards the bottom of the display and that leads to a lot of typos., The software has a smart booster to free up RAM and clean junk files, a gaming mode to free up resources for games, and a bunch of Honor-centric apps that unfortunately cannot be uninstalled., , Honor’s cameras have proven to be the highlight of their product. They are adequately blessed with AI capabilities that, depending on where you stand, can augment or ruin the photos the phone takes. It’s the same for the Honor 8X.

You do get a TPU case bundled in the box which will offer some protection to the glass back. The fingerprint sensor dips lower in the body and is easy to find while holding the phone upright. The Honor logo and the camera information are all written in landscape mode, indicating that it’s meant to be used in that orientation, like how it is on the Huawei P20 Pro (review)., Turn it around and the screen takes precedence. The Honor 8X perhaps has the largest display in the sub-15K price segment. It’s significantly wide and cannot be used by just one hand. The panel also takes up most of the real estate up front with a 91 percent screen-to-body ratio. The bottom chin has been shaved off even more making the screen-to-body ratio one of the highlights of the phone., Despite a glass body, the phone is built quite sturdy. The aluminium frame housing the glass panels on both sides feel strong and there’s no flex whatsoever. The corners are also rounded off to offer a better grip. By default the screen also adapts to the rounded corners, but if you choose to hide the notch, the symmetry gets messed up completely. The camera on the back juts out of the body with sharp edges. If you carry a second device in the same pocket as this phone, there’s a chance the camera bump would scratch the other device., , The Honor 8X’s panel is a massive chunk of glass. Sitting at 6.5-inches measured diagonally, it’s much more than what the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Realme 2 Pro offer. The larger screen size is abetted by the notch on top of course, which incidentally isn’t all that big (not Pixel 3 XL-like big, I mean) and a smaller chin. It may be 7.8mm thin, but the width of the display means it’s almost impossible to use with just one hand. The elements on the screen; Icons, texts, images, and the likes all appear quite large. As a result, you’re essentially reading the same amount of text you’d read in a smaller 6-inch panel, unless you decide to shrink the size of the text. Also, it’s easy to register accidental touches while trying to reach to the other end of the panel., , The 6.5-inch IPS LCD panel itself is quite bright and vibrant and was easily legible under direct sunlight. By default, the panel uses a vivid colour mode that ups the contrast and saturation to a great extent making content appear richer than it actually is. It’s problematic if you’re planning to edit photos or videos in your phone, but watching content from Netflix and YouTube is a good enough experience. The extra screen real estate also makes things more immersive. It’s also a good display to play games like PubG Mobile on, where a bigger screen gives an advantage., , A big-screen phone demands stable and fast performance and the Honor 8X relies on a HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC for that. It’s coupled with up to 6GB RAM and up to 128GB storage. The unit we received for review has 4GB RAM and 64GB storage though, and considering it performs well enough in this configuration, the higher variant will only be better, if not the same. It’s also the first time Honor has used the Kirin 710 SoC in a mid-range phone and could be an indication that it’s finally retiring the aged Kirin 659. The Kirin 710 is a 12nm based chipset with an octa-core configuration. The performance cores can go all the way up to 2.2GHz which is a little higher than what the Snapdragon 660 can clock. Benchmark reports take this into account. Honor also offers a dedicated slot to expand storage which is much welcome. Thankfully, it is a standard MicroSD card slot and not a propreiatry Nano memory card slot like the one on the recently announced Huawei Mate 20 Pro (first impressions)., , , On AnTuTu 6.0, the Honor 8X scored 139785 which is higher than the Snapdragon 660-powered Realme 2 Pro’s 128430, while on Geekbench Single and Multi core tests, the Honor 8X scored 1602 and 5435 respectively, which is again significantly higher than what the Snapdragon 660 smartphones score. On 3DMark’s Slingshot test, the Honor 8X scored 1437, which is the only place where the Kirin 710 falls behind as compared to the Snapdragon 660. It’s a clear indication that Huawei’s new chipset is quite ahead of Qualcomm’s top-of-the-line mid-range chip in the market right now. But does it lead to a boost in performance?, The Honor 8X works perfectly fine — Smooth transitions, relatively quicker app launches, and negligible stutter while scrolling in apps like Facebook that continuously process data as you scroll down the timeline. Multi-tasking is also good enough although EMUI’s aggressive RAM management tends to kill apps that are active in the background. Essentially, if you have minimised Amazon Prime Video to reply to a message on Facebook, and then go back to watching, you’ll have to start from the main screen which is a bummer., As for gaming, the benchmark did suggest the GPU on the Kirin 710 isn’t really as good as what Qualcomm offers in the Snapdragon 660, but Honor leverages the GPU Turbo technology to improve gameplay. However, GPU Turbo is only restricted to selected games. Thankfully, that includes PubG Mobile which is what most people are playing these days. It runs on medium settings but the frame rate is stable enough with minimal lag., , The Honor 8X may be a good looking smartphone from the outside, but EMUI 8.2 on the inside takes away from the beauty. The Android 8.1-based UI has large icons which aren’t aesthetically pleasing. It comes running the September 2018 security patch which is a sign of good things. Honor did promise the phone will be updated to Android 9 Pie but they didn’t share a timeline. There’s also NFC and Face Unlock (it’s a bit slower than the physical sensor and not that secure) as well. The Honor 8X comes preloaded with apps like Netflix, Messenger, Instagram, Facebook and more. It depends on your usage whether you’ll call it bloatware, but they can all be uninstalled. The phone also supports gesture-based navigation that seems to be a rip-off of iOS’ gestures, but aren’t as intuitive. It has a steep learning curve and when the gesture navigation is turned on, the keyboard shifts down towards the bottom of the display and that leads to a lot of typos., The software has a smart booster to free up RAM and clean junk files, a gaming mode to free up resources for games, and a bunch of Honor-centric apps that unfortunately cannot be uninstalled., , Honor’s cameras have proven to be the highlight of their product. They are adequately blessed with AI capabilities that, depending on where you stand, can augment or ruin the photos the phone takes. It’s the same for the Honor 8X. There is a 20MP camera with f/1.8 aperture combined with a 2MP depth sensor. The camera on the back is capable of taking AI-enabled portrait shots where you can vary the depth of field in real-time. Up front is a 16 MP f/2.0 sensor which can take selfies with portrait lighting effects., The camera quality isn’t much to write home about. It’s what we have seen in other Honor and Huawei phones in that price range over this year. Oversaturated colours, high contrasts and overall a photo that looks very artificial. Turning the AI mode on recognises what you’re shooting (plants, sunsets, buildings, etc.) and applies an additional layer of saturation on it., Daylight, , The Honor 8X, like most phones in the mid-range segment, can take good photos when there’s ample light. The samples we shot for the phone aren’t really the best considering how Delhi gets shrouded under a thick blanket of smog during this time, but based on what we saw, it’s likely to deliver decent results. The white balance is slightly off the mark though with a tendency to use a warmer white balance in photos shot during the day, that is if you have the AI mode turned on. The shadow regions also lose out on the details and the camera takes a slightly longer time to focus. Frankly, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro seems to do a better job at taking photos. If you’re considering to buy the 6GB variant, you can also look at the Mi A2 which has a fantastic camera., Indoors, , When indoors, the camera tends to prefer the source of light for metering, making the frame darker. The AI mode here tries to recover details and manages to do that just barely well enough. When exposing for things away from the source of light though, the Honor 8X does light up the scene but the source of light is blown out., Lowlight, , Moving on to low-light, this is where the camera struggles. Keeping the AI mode turned on will let the camera recognise you’re shooting a low-light shot and it’ll effectively attempt to brighten up the scene. In the end, it just bumps up the ISO and slows down the shutter speed without taking care of the stabilisation. You have to keep the phone pointed at the scene for longer and a slight shake ruins the photos., Battery, , The Honor 8X has a rather large 3,750mAh battery. But when you take the large 6.5-inch panel into account, the battery doesn’t seem to be all that big. Nevertheless, it got us through the day easily. We’re yet to run the PCMark Work 2.0 test on it and will update this review once the results are in. But it seems like the battery is just about enough to last the day if you are a medium to heavy user. Playing games like PubG though will drain the battery much faster and you’ll have to plug it in by around 7PM in the evening., The phone charges using a microUSB port and a bundled 10W charger which tops up the battery in around an hour and a half., The Honor 8X is a big-screen phone with an affordable price tag. It’s a good experience to watch videos on it, play games, but the phone itself is quite unwieldy. It’s glossy design and generous amounts of glass might did put me off, but it’s up to you, the buyer, to decide whether you want something that looks good but is quite delicate at the same time. The performance in general is quite commendable but the UI, like all Honor and Huawei phones aren’t the best, aesthetically speaking. As for the camera, it can take decent photos in daylight, but expecting a good low-light performance from it is a bit too much."

I was reeling off a binge-watch of the season when the Honor 9 Lite dropped (cautiously) in my hands.  The name of the series, Black Mirror, essentially means, “the reflection of an unlit computer screen”, and when I noticed the all-glass design of the phone, the whole essence of the phrase became more apparent. Honor’s latest offering is all-glass-everywhere, perfected in a way that when the tall screen turned off, I was left rethinking my life as I saw myself. , Essentially, the Honor 9 Lite is an stunningly good looking phone, but that’s about it. Everything else about the phone is more or less mediocre and something that you would expect from mid-range phones anyway. The new glass design and the quad cameras seems to be just ticks on a checklist to set itself apart from the rest. And while it does manage to grab attention from curious onlookers, you will be left disappointed when actually using the phone as a daily driver. , , There are phones that are practical, and then there are phones that just grab eyeballs without living up to the expectation they set. Take the Google Pixel 2 and the iPhone X in the premium range for example. The Pixel 2 does not boast of a modern design. It’s quite retro in the way it’s built, as compared to the revolutionary iPhone X which comes in an all-glass body. Between the two, the latter will definitely grab more attention than the former, but at the same time, the Pixel 2 will edge out the iPhone in terms of value for money. , Huawei Honor 8C 64GB Review, Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Huawei Honor 10 Lite Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, A similar conundrum is now raging in the mid-range segment, now that the Honor 9 Lite is out in the market. It looks like it was carved from a piece of glass which gives a premium feel to the phone. It actually feels quite underpriced for the materials used. But then there are phones like the Lenovo K8 Plus which may have copious amount of plastic in the body, but does the job it’s made to do., We received the 4GB/64GB storage variant and In our review of the Honor 9 Lite, we come to the conclusion that looks are not everything. It’s the overall package, and a consistent performance that makes all the difference., Design, , The Honor 9 Lite is an exquisitely crafted smartphone. There’s glass everywhere. Front, back, around the edges. It is so well made that it feels more like an artifact than a device you would use daily. The glass-enclosed design will remind you of the older Honor 8, but this one feels more compact thanks to the 5.6-inch Univisium display housed in a 6-inch body. There’s more screen real estate because of the 18:9 aspect ratio. , Phones are no stranger to glass designs. Before the metal unibody design took over phones, glass was used to set premium phones apart from the rest. Phones with glass bodies have a snug and smooth hand feel, but they are also prone to damage. It is primarily because of that reason that manufacturers switched to aluminium bodies that gave phones the longevity glass couldn’t. Yet, more recently, glass made a comeback, not because phones needed to look better, but for wireless charging. It was an acceptable trade-off. But the Honor 9 Lite, despite having an all-glass body does not have wireless charging. So it’s safe to assume, Honor’s choice to use glass was for aesthetics only. And in that regard, the phone just oozes a premium feel. But is the glass durable enough to withstand the daily wear and tear phones tend to go through? , , Well, Honor certainly thinks the phone can withstand shocks and scratches. But I wasn’t convinced. Honor claims it has used a 12-layer coating on the glass and a special nano-optical film on top to prevent scratches. Less than a week of using the phone, I had two deep scratches at the back of the phone which was probably caused by the house-keys I was carrying in my pocket along with the phone. , The Honor 9 Lite is a phone that looks stunning, but if you intend to use it as your daily driver, you will have to slap a case on the back of it. What’s the point of having a stunning design if you can’t flaunt it to the world? , Nevertheless, the phone itself is quite compact compared to other offerings in its price range. In fact, the dimensions are similar to Honor’s other offerings — The Honor 9i and the Honor 7X. In fact, the Honor 9 Lite is much smaller compared to the two. It’s not completely bezel-less though as there are distinct borders around the edges and thick upper and lower chins. At the back, the dual camera unit is housed on the top left corner while the fingerprint sensor sits in the upper central coloumn. The power and volume rockers are on the right edge and they are quite responsive and clicky. The phone also relies on a micro-USB port to charge and that’s a bummer. , In a sense, the Honor 9 Lite is a culmination of all the design cues from the company since the Honor 9i launched in India. Honor has perfected the colour offerings as well and the 9 Lite comes in three beautifully crafted colours — Saphire Blue,  Glacier Gray, and Midnight Black. , Display, , Taller, 18:9 displays are now a common sight in smartphones. It took surprisingly less time for the technology to trickle down to lower price segments but 2017 saw phones across a broad price range launch with the new display formats. The Honor 9 Lite is the fourth offering from Honor in India featuring the 18:9 display. For one, because of its proprietary chipset, the Honor 9i is one of the few mid-range phones to offer an FHD+ (2160x1080p) resolution. That means, the phone packs a lot more pixels in the 5.6-inch panel than most, making photos and videos look vibrant and full of colours. , The display also didn’t have the cool blueish tint that other Honor phones have. In fact, I found the Honor 9 Lite’s display has a more accurate white point. You can play around with the colour temperature though and Honor also gives you the option to dial down the resolution to 720p if required. , Yet, one of the major problems the display will face is incompatibility with apps. Not all content is calibrated for taller displays, yet. So some Android games like Injustice 2 will have menus cropped when you go full-screen, although Netflix and YouTube should work fine. , The display had a measured luminescence rating of 570 nits which is quite good for the price. Although, because this is an IPS LCD panel, you won’t get the deep contrasts on the Honor 9 Lite. As a result, while the brightness is enough to be legible under direct sunlight, content might seem a little bland.  , Performance, , As a subsidiary of Huawei, Honor devices have the honour (get it?) to use the company’s proprietary chipsets. The Honor 9 Lite is no exception. But weirdly enough, all the newly launched mid-range phones by Honor are powered by the same chipset — The HiSilicon Kirin 659.  Like the Honor 7X and the Honor 9i, the Honor 8 Lite too is offered in 3GB and 4GB RAM variants with 32GB and 64GB of storage respectively. Even weirder is the margin of difference the three phones had on benchmark tests. While there wasn’t much separating the phones on AnTuTu or Geekbench 4, 3D Mark, which calculates graphical prowess of the phone, gave drastically low scores. , After scratching our heads for sometime, we figured it could be that the chipset’s drivers are not optimised for Vulcan API which is enabled by default on Android Oreo.  Futuremark notes on its website that “devices that shipped with early Vulkan drivers may have performance and stability issues in this test. Vulkan performance can be much lower than expected and the test can crash on devices with underdeveloped Vulkan drivers.” , Nevertheless, real world usage will show no difference. The phone did not slow down even after opening a lot of apps in one go. There are also no drops in framerates while playing games like Asphalt 8: Nitro and loading times are impressive. The phone feels faster for its price of Rs 14,999 and that speaks a lot for mid-range phones where the raw performance is not always the priority. , The phone is also optimised to run quite fast. It takes around 35 seconds to boot which is commendable and the fingerprint sensor works blazing fast. Overall, we felt the phone is quite fast for the price it retails for, and that should be an encouraging sign of the phones to come this year. ,   
Camera, , The highlight of the Honor 9 Lite is its Quad-camera setup. Honor has done this overkill before with the Honor 9i and now, it has trickled down the novelty to a price where dual cameras are just starting to come in. There are two cameras on the front, and two at the back. On both sides, the primary camera is of 13-megapixel resolution and there is an additional 2-megapixel sensor to capture depth information. The twin cameras on both sides are mostly for portrait mode. Yes, portrait mode is present on both the front and the rear camera. But based on what we saw, the cameras are not that impressive. They do take quality images under perfect light, but it’s not that consistent. , , Under direct sunlight, the colours are somewhat faded and whitened out. You will notice the blue sky has become white around the edges while in the center, the saturation is way too low. Yes, it was a rare blue sky on a cold winter afternoon in Delhi that day. , , If you take photos against harsh sunlight, expect a loss in focus and soft-touches to objects. What’s commendable though is the lack of shadows in the photo under such tricky lighting. , , The whitening effect of the camera becomes more prominent in the photo above. The walls should have a yellowish glow considering its peak afternoon outside and the white balance is always warmer in such situations. But the phone whitewashes the walls to an even whiter shade than it should, for aesthetics? , , Having said that, under indoor lighting, the camera can reproduce vibrant and punchy colours, which is what Honor’s cameras are famous for. Even then, we faced some difficulty to bring objects into focus. A quick shot will most likely be out of focus. It is only when you spend some time composing the shot will you get decent results. , , Low light shots are as you would expect from a mid-range phone. Noisy, and lacking in detail. Also, it takes significantly more time to focus and then some more time to process the photo after shooting. But the end result isn’t as impressive. There is some amount of noise reduction and sharpening that happens, but you won’t make out finer details from a photo taken under low light. , , As for the portrait mode, the Honor 9 Lite will aggressively blur the background, so much so, that the main object in focus sometimes loses detail. The portrait mode also makes photos overexposed which is never a good thing. , , The story of the front camera is also the same. There is the same odd whitening effect prevalent in selfies, even more so, because of the beautify effects. The portrait mode from the front camera has the same issue of overexposing the shot. , To be honest, the camera is better than what phones at that price offer, but if you are buying the phone simply for the camera, it’s better to think again. , 
Software , , A phone that’s coming out in the beginning of 2018 shouldn’t come with anything less than the latest version of Android, and the Honor 9 Lite doesn’t disappoint in that regard. The phone comes with EMUI 8.0 based on Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box even when new phones launching in January are still running older versions of Android. , Having said that, the interface is nowhere near as light as stock Android. It’s still faster than the previous EMUI 5.0 as the new version takes advantage of the lightweight nature of Android Oreo. It has also cut down on some system animations and now the UI feels much smoother. That could also be because the Honor 9 Lite uses the F2FS (Flash-based files storage) system that prevents the phone from slowing down over time apart from increasing app loading times. , The UI offers a new way to navigate the phone using a navigation dock. It’s like an on-screen trackball that allow users to go back, go to the homescreen or hit the recents menu. It’s quite nifty for one-handed use. , There are a bunch of pre-loaded apps including a second Gallery App, a separate mail and music app, and the likes, which may make sense in the Chinese market (where the phone originally launched), but in India, it’s just taking up precious space. Apart from these, you get the usual Honor suite of apps. , There are a couple of India-centric features on the phone as well — Paytm is integrated in the software and there is a dedicated bike mode that prevents the phone from buzzing while you are riding. , Android Oreo also brings new features like picture-in-picture, deeper notification management and more. , Latest Android is always welcome on a phone, but considering how heavily customised the interface is, it’s remains to be seen whether future updates will be rolled out in time. , Battery, , The Honor 9 Lite sports a 3,000mAh battery which is just about enough to last you through the day. The phone lasted around 7 hours on PC Mark’s battery test which is commendable. We also used the phone like a daily driver with generous amounts of social media browsing, playing YouTube videos, and browsing the web apart from half an hour of gaming and copious use of the camera to take photos. , The phone uses a micro-USB port to charge which is disappointing considering how the USB Type-C is fast becoming the convention across devices. There is support for fast charging and “smart battery saving”technology which essentially monitors active apps running in the background, manage screen-timeout and location settings to extend the battery life. , How it compares? , The Honor 9 Lite will score full marks in terms of design but lose out on durability. It will impress with the number of cameras on the body, but will disappoint with the image quality. The phone will again feel fast and smooth, but Honor’s track record of providing timely updates is questionable. However, for the price of Rs 14,999, the Lenovo K8 Plus is also a good option to keep in mind. It may not have the attractive design of the Honor 9 Lite, but it more than makes up for it in terms of performance and camera quality. The higher variant of the Honor 9 Lite will go up against the Xiaomi Mi A1 and its own Honor 7X. Between the three, it will come down to the interface you are used to, the most and the build quality. 4GB of RAM should more than compensate for the heavily modded EMUI interface and take it at par with the Mi A1. "

While there wasn’t much separating the phones on AnTuTu or Geekbench 4, 3D Mark, which calculates graphical prowess of the phone, gave drastically low scores. , After scratching our heads for sometime, we figured it could be that the chipset’s drivers are not optimised for Vulcan API which is enabled by default on Android Oreo.  Futuremark notes on its website that “devices that shipped with early Vulkan drivers may have performance and stability issues in this test. Vulkan performance can be much lower than expected and the test can crash on devices with underdeveloped Vulkan drivers.” , Nevertheless, real world usage will show no difference. The phone did not slow down even after opening a lot of apps in one go. There are also no drops in framerates while playing games like Asphalt 8: Nitro and loading times are impressive. The phone feels faster for its price of Rs 14,999 and that speaks a lot for mid-range phones where the raw performance is not always the priority. , The phone is also optimised to run quite fast. It takes around 35 seconds to boot which is commendable and the fingerprint sensor works blazing fast. Overall, we felt the phone is quite fast for the price it retails for, and that should be an encouraging sign of the phones to come this year. ,   
Camera, , The highlight of the Honor 9 Lite is its Quad-camera setup. Honor has done this overkill before with the Honor 9i and now, it has trickled down the novelty to a price where dual cameras are just starting to come in. There are two cameras on the front, and two at the back. On both sides, the primary camera is of 13-megapixel resolution and there is an additional 2-megapixel sensor to capture depth information. The twin cameras on both sides are mostly for portrait mode. Yes, portrait mode is present on both the front and the rear camera. But based on what we saw, the cameras are not that impressive. They do take quality images under perfect light, but it’s not that consistent. , , Under direct sunlight, the colours are somewhat faded and whitened out. You will notice the blue sky has become white around the edges while in the center, the saturation is way too low. Yes, it was a rare blue sky on a cold winter afternoon in Delhi that day. , , If you take photos against harsh sunlight, expect a loss in focus and soft-touches to objects. What’s commendable though is the lack of shadows in the photo under such tricky lighting. , , The whitening effect of the camera becomes more prominent in the photo above. The walls should have a yellowish glow considering its peak afternoon outside and the white balance is always warmer in such situations. But the phone whitewashes the walls to an even whiter shade than it should, for aesthetics? , , Having said that, under indoor lighting, the camera can reproduce vibrant and punchy colours, which is what Honor’s cameras are famous for. Even then, we faced some difficulty to bring objects into focus. A quick shot will most likely be out of focus. It is only when you spend some time composing the shot will you get decent results. , , Low light shots are as you would expect from a mid-range phone. Noisy, and lacking in detail. Also, it takes significantly more time to focus and then some more time to process the photo after shooting. But the end result isn’t as impressive. There is some amount of noise reduction and sharpening that happens, but you won’t make out finer details from a photo taken under low light. , , As for the portrait mode, the Honor 9 Lite will aggressively blur the background, so much so, that the main object in focus sometimes loses detail. The portrait mode also makes photos overexposed which is never a good thing. , , The story of the front camera is also the same. There is the same odd whitening effect prevalent in selfies, even more so, because of the beautify effects. The portrait mode from the front camera has the same issue of overexposing the shot. , To be honest, the camera is better than what phones at that price offer, but if you are buying the phone simply for the camera, it’s better to think again. , 
Software , , A phone that’s coming out in the beginning of 2018 shouldn’t come with anything less than the latest version of Android, and the Honor 9 Lite doesn’t disappoint in that regard. The phone comes with EMUI 8.0 based on Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box even when new phones launching in January are still running older versions of Android. , Having said that, the interface is nowhere near as light as stock Android. It’s still faster than the previous EMUI 5.0 as the new version takes advantage of the lightweight nature of Android Oreo. It has also cut down on some system animations and now the UI feels much smoother. That could also be because the Honor 9 Lite uses the F2FS (Flash-based files storage) system that prevents the phone from slowing down over time apart from increasing app loading times. , The UI offers a new way to navigate the phone using a navigation dock. It’s like an on-screen trackball that allow users to go back, go to the homescreen or hit the recents menu. It’s quite nifty for one-handed use. , There are a bunch of pre-loaded apps including a second Gallery App, a separate mail and music app, and the likes, which may make sense in the Chinese market (where the phone originally launched), but in India, it’s just taking up precious space. Apart from these, you get the usual Honor suite of apps. , There are a couple of India-centric features on the phone as well — Paytm is integrated in the software and there is a dedicated bike mode that prevents the phone from buzzing while you are riding. , Android Oreo also brings new features like picture-in-picture, deeper notification management and more. , Latest Android is always welcome on a phone, but considering how heavily customised the interface is, it’s remains to be seen whether future updates will be rolled out in time. , Battery, , The Honor 9 Lite sports a 3,000mAh battery which is just about enough to last you through the day. The phone lasted around 7 hours on PC Mark’s battery test which is commendable. We also used the phone like a daily driver with generous amounts of social media browsing, playing YouTube videos, and browsing the web apart from half an hour of gaming and copious use of the camera to take photos. , The phone uses a micro-USB port to charge which is disappointing considering how the USB Type-C is fast becoming the convention across devices. There is support for fast charging and “smart battery saving”technology which essentially monitors active apps running in the background, manage screen-timeout and location settings to extend the battery life. , How it compares? , The Honor 9 Lite will score full marks in terms of design but lose out on durability. It will impress with the number of cameras on the body, but will disappoint with the image quality. The phone will again feel fast and smooth, but Honor’s track record of providing timely updates is questionable. However, for the price of Rs 14,999, the Lenovo K8 Plus is also a good option to keep in mind. It may not have the attractive design of the Honor 9 Lite, but it more than makes up for it in terms of performance and camera quality. The higher variant of the Honor 9 Lite will go up against the Xiaomi Mi A1 and its own Honor 7X. Between the three, it will come down to the interface you are used to, the most and the build quality. 4GB of RAM should more than compensate for the heavily modded EMUI interface and take it at par with the Mi A1. "
2189,42,huawei-honor-9i-review-68440,0,0,2019-05-22,68440,Hardik Singh,Huawei Honor 9i Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/huawei-honor-9i-review-68440.html,"The Honor 9i is not the best phone in the sub-20K smartphone category, but it still manages to put up a good case for itself. It is well built, is a decent performer, offers good image taking experience and has a dependable battery life., , Smartphones as a category have evolved since their inception. It is quite fascinating that modern smartphones offer as much RAM as the laptop I am using to write this review. While 8GB RAM on phones isn’t particularly mainstream yet, other features like dual-cameras and 18:9 aspect ratios are. We have seen quite a few phones this year with dual-camera and taller displays. And keeping in tune with the trends, Huawei has brought the Honor 9i to the market. It is the first phone in India to sport four camera (two on each side) and 18:9 aspect ratio., Huawei Honor 8C 64GB Review, Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Huawei Honor 10 Lite Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, , But, as with any of these feature rich devices, one wonders whether you actually need all of this. We tested the phone over an extended period to find out., Build and Design
On paper, the 2+2 camera setup seems to be the most important aspect of the phone, but we think Huawei has done better with the build and design. The phone may not look as intriguing as it does in marketing material, but the aluminum chassis complete with the matte finish, gives it a far more premium look and feel than its peers. The quality of materials used is top notch and the matte black version we reviewed looks quite appealing. The slimmer bezels around the display means one can hold this 5.9-inch device in one hand with ease. However, the taller stance and higher mounted volume rocker has you shifting your grip to reach the buttons often. Good thing is that the EMUI lets you pull down the notification bar with the software key (more on that later). , , , Rear Camera
The Honor 9i offers a 16MP + 2MP camera setup on the back, which works on the same fundamental tech used on the Honor 8 Pro. So, here the 16MP primary camera is taking all your images and the 2MP secondary sensor adds depth data to those images. The two cameras together produce some really good images during the day in and in ample lighting conditions. Images have decent details and good colour saturation most of the times. The f/2.2 aperture on the primary lens seems weak for low light, but it does a good enough job. Images taken in low light conditions have good colour reproduction and at times, decent amount of details. Honor’s noise reduction algorithm isn't as good as some of its peers though. , , , , , , Having said that, the camera is inconsistent at times and we observed aberrations in colour reproduction and lack of details, respectively, in daylight and low light. This happens a tad too often to call this a dependable camera. The Honor 9i produced low detail levels in low light sometimes, while it did really well sometimes., The dual camera setup also lets you take bokeh like images, which are good. Background and foreground separation is good, as is the colour saturation. Low light Bokeh images do require a steady hand, but otherwise come out to be fine. , , , , Front Camera
Like the rear camera, the front facing camera is also quite good. There is a 13MP + 2MP setup on the front, which works on the same methodology as the rear camera. This makes the front facing shooter one of the best we have seen in its price category. The camera captures good details, subjects look reasonably sharp and the beauty mode does not make your face all pink. Although, the beauty mode aggressively softens photos and even wheatish skin tones come out lighter. , , You can take bokeh photos with the front camera too, which works quite well. In fact, we reckon this might be the best selfie bokeh taking camera under the sub-20K smartphone category. The phones does an equally good job in low light and normal lighting conditions., , , Display and UI
The other defining feature on the phone is the display. This is Huawei’s first phone to feature the taller 18:9 aspect ratio. The company has chosen a 5.9-inch IPS LCD display for the job, which gets the job done. It has decent colour saturation and even on this large screen size, its 2160 x 1080p resolution seems to be doing justice to the UI as well as the content. However, the unorthodox screen size means the UI often prompts the user to turn on fit to size. , , You can choose between warmer or cooler tones if you don’t like the default colour fidelity. We did not observe any light bleed on the display though the brightness is quite low. We recorded max luminance of just 385 lux, which is much lower than any other phone in its price category. This also affects the sunlight visibility of the device, which is average at best., Running the show on the software front is EMUI 5.1, which is layered on top of Android Nougat. The UI feels refined and it seems like Huawei has been taking user feedback into account, thus making the whole UX simpler. By default, you get the normal interface without an app drawer, but you can switch to an app drawer style interface from settings. The notifications and quick toggle menu can be called using a dedicated software button on the bottom navigation panel. This is a good trick, as you don’t have to shuffle the phone in your hand to reach the top of the display. Although, to reach the topmost quick toggles, you would have to eventually move the phone. You also get a version of “spotlight search” feature, which does not work as seamlessly. The service does manage to find keywords among contacts and SMS, but fails to consistently provide the right results for linked google services., , Another thing worth pointing out is that Huawei is still not cutting down on useless apps, such as Mirror and Torch, which can easily be replaced by the front facing camera and a quick toggle. You still get a dedicated mail app, two Honor store apps and a Honor forum web shortcut, which are not really required. It’s good that Honor is providing a gallery app, UC browser, Videos app, weather app, a sound recorder app and more, but all this can easily be replaced by third party apps. Thankfully, some of these apps can be uninstalled, while others have to be disabled., Performance
With the Honor 9i, Huawei is also debuting its Kirin 659 chipset in India. This is an octa-core SoC, comprising of eight ARM Cortex A53 cores. It is made using the 16nm manufacturing process and from the synthetic benchmarks we ran, it looks at par with competition. Even in real life day-to-day performance with no gaming involved, the Honor 9i felt just as smooth and efficient as any other device in the same price bracket. However, as soon as you bring gaming into the picture, the Honor 9i begins to stutter. Its stuttering and occasional lags are not really a deal-breaker and you won’t notice them unless you have a used a better phone before. , , Overall, the performance of the device is not groundbreaking, but it is has just enough to get the job done. Moreover, there are no heating issues on the phone. It does get a tad warm while using the camera or playing a game, but it never became uncomfortable., The cell reception on the phone was good as well and we didn't observe any anomalies in terms of 4G speeds or VoLTE calling., On the audio side, we should mention that the single bottom mounted speaker is decently loud, but it is not very accurate. However, as soon as you attach a headphone to the phone, Huawei’s Histen sound effects are enabled, giving the user equaliser settings. There is a 3D audio sound setting as well, which when turned cancels out the equaliser settings. It does improve your listening experience, and is as good as competing Dolby Atmos enabled devices. , Battery life
Using the phone for more than a week, we have observed that its performance is balanced out to provide better battery life. So, in default mode with brightness on auto, the phone provided an entire 24 hours of battery life with some minor gaming (30 minutes). It loses less than 3 percent of charge when kept on standby for almost 10 hours, which is quite good. This battery life can be further elongated by using the extra power saving modes available in the settings. However, if you are gamer at heart, you would need to carry a power bank as the phone eats up battery very quickly while gaming. The same is true with the camera app. The sad part is that the phone does not support fast charging, nor does it use a Type-C port., , Bottomline
The Honor 9i is amongst the best phones in the sub-20k category, but it’s not perfect. It has well built, has a decent display, but its performance should have been better. Also, the camera needs some tuning so as to be more consistent. It can last you all day on a single charge, but only if you’re not playing games., , All that said, the Honor 9i is certainly amongst our recommended devices, but it’s not the most value for money device. The new FHD+ display along with the 2 + 2 camera setup does add some value to the phone, but it still does not make the best buy in the category., How it compares
The Honor 9i goes up against the likes of the Moto G5s Plus, Xiaomi Mi A1 and Samsung Galaxy On Max. While the performance of the Honor 9i is almost at par with its competitors, it is better built than any of them. The 9i also has the best selfie camera among sub-20K smartphones, and offers bokeh from both front and rear shooters. Its battery life needs work, but it is not bad in any way and is definitely dependable., The Moto G5 Plus remains the better buy in this segment, but the Honor 9i is certainly one you can consider, especially if you want a better front camera."
2282,42,huawei-honor-9n-review-134316,0,0,2019-05-22,134316,Swapnil Mathur,Huawei Honor 9N Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/huawei-honor-9n-review-134316.html,"The Honor 9N is a well-built device for its price range and offers good colour options in the sub-15K price bracket. However, it uses a dated Kirin 659 chipset and does not offer fast charging. The camera can deliver nice photos in good lighting conditons, but falters badly in low light. Overall, the Honor 9N fails to stand out from the competition when it comes to overall performance. If good overall performance is what you are looking for, then you can't go wrong with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro in this price segment., , Honor has been on a roll over the last few months, launching phones across price brackets and feature sets. The Honor 10 was this year’s flagship which was supposed to go head-to-head with the OnePlus 6, and now, we have the Honor 9n, which is supposed to be the company’s budget segment offering. The Honor 9N comes with a modest specification set, the promise of GPU Turbo, and a rather neat build & design. However, the question remains, is the Honor 9N worth the money you’re going to be shelling out for it? We find out., Huawei Honor 8C 64GB Review, Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Huawei Honor 10 Lite Review, Huawei Honor View 20 Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, Build and Design
The Honor 9N is made of 12-layered glass which follows a very similar design language to the Honor 10. Our review unit is the Sapphire Blue version, although Honor also has a Midnight Black (mirror finish), Lavender Purple and an oddly named Robin Egg Blue, which is a gorgeous shade of sea green. Unlike the Honor 10 which had a very seamless blend of the back with the metal frame, the Honor 9N feels like three distinct layers; the glass back and the glass front held together by the metal frame. The glass back feels more like polycarbonate, and the only thing wrong with it is that you might think the phone is sturdier than it actually is. I’ve had a bad experience with phones which have a glass back, so the included case in the box is a welcome addition. Honestly, the use of glass on smartphones which don’t have wireless charging makes little sense since it makes the phone more prone to damage than their metal counterparts. The fingerprint sensor sits on the back of the device instead of being on the front chin. The placement of the fingerprint sensor is a very personal choice, as I prefer it on the front, while many prefer it to be on the back. Either way, it isn’t difficult to reach for one-handed operation., , The front of the phone has a 19:9 display and there’s not much else going on here in terms of design. The side frame has rounded edges with the volume rocker and power button on one side, and the SIM tray on the other. The headphone jack, speaker grille and MicroUSB charging port are all at the bottom., , Overall, it is nice to see Honor take design cues from the Honor 10 and bring them to a cheaper smartphone. The phone feels very light to hold, the glass back feels more like polycarbonate, but is extremely glossy and hence prone to fingerprints. This is again where the included case comes in handy. The case has a frosted finish and will hide the colour of your phone. Overall, the Honor 9N is a well-built device for its price., Display
The Honor 9N comes with an FHD+ 19:9 display. The 2280x1080 pixels are fit into a 5.8-inch display, giving it an effective pixel density of roughly 432ppi, a sufficiently high number by most standards. The smartphone has an IPS-LCD display which means excellent colour reproduction and very impressive viewing angles. The notch is supposed to offer more real estate but still remains a hotly debated design choice, as it seems to take away just as much as it offers. The phone isn’t bezel-less as it has very miniscule bezels on the side, and a notable chin at the bottom used for branding., In my use, I found the Honor 9N’s display to be rather impressive. The Full HD resolution obviously makes things look good. A peak brightness of 184 nits (631 lux) makes the display very legible. Outdoors, the display retains its saturation, but the reflective display does make it difficult to watch movies, although you should be able to browse the web and respond to texts without much trouble., , At night time while reading a book on the phone, it was nice to be able to turn the brightness down to 1 nit, a very comfortable level of illumination for reading in pitch darkness. While there is a blue light filter, the display settings also give users the ability to tune the colour tint manually, alongside a standard “warm” and “cool” display setting. Unfortunately, there is no way to tune the saturation of the display., Overall, the display of the Honor 9N is extremely functional, with good saturation levels right out of the box. The ability to tune the white balance of the display is nice, but a lack of saturation control could be bothersome. While the Honor 9N’s display is well balanced, those who like their display saturation to be higher than normal would not be pleased with the lack of an ability to fine tune this aspect of the display. The whole point of the new 19:9 aspect ratio is to be able to offer bezel-less displays, however, the Honor 9N keeps the bezels, no matter how narrow they may be., Performance
The Honor 9N is powered by the Kirin 695 chipset and our review unit is the 4GB RAM variant with 64GB storage. Huawei, Honor’s parent company, recently announced GPU Turbo, a feature that the company will roll out through a software update to boost the performance pushed out by the GPU while gaming. This feature is coming to many Huawei and Honor phones and is currently not available for the Honor 9N. It is, however, expected later this year via a software update. As of now, we’ve got the Kirin 659 which is a Snapdragon 625-grade SoC and 4GB of RAM to power the phone., In our benchmarks, the phone does not fare very well. It scored 184 in the GFX Bench Car Chase test and 936 in the Geekbench Single Core test. The Honor 9N’s 3DMark Sling Shot score was 284 while the 3D Mark Ice Storm score was 12500. These numbers show that the Honor 9N isn’t exactly the gaming beast you would want it to be. We explored this further in our gaming sessions with the phone., , I played four games on the phone; Asphalt Extreme, Shadowgun Legends, PUBG and Subway Surfers. Asphalt Extreme plays smooth, but there is a visibly lower number of particle effects. While driving through dirt or water, you will notice the water (or the dirt) that is kicked up by the tyres look more like square blobs than the real thing. When playing the same game on higher-end devices, these textures are much nicer and much more well defined. The gameplay itself isn’t too problematic, with everything working smoothly. Playing PUBG on the phone, the load times were noticeably slow and the textures weren’t as visually appealing, then again, the gameplay was pretty smooth. Taking aim with and without the sights was once again stutter-free. Shadowgun Legends is where I found the most lag, both during missions and in the lobby. The stutters weren’t excessive for the most part, but at times when the map had too many opponents, things became very slow and hence, the game became too slow to play properly., , Moving onto day-to-day performance, the phone manages to do fairly well. Between the 15+ tabs in Google Chrome, Play Store, Gmail, navigation and the handful of messaging apps, the Honor 9N manages to deliver a decent experience. When there was a game left running in the background, the phone tended to stutter a little while switching windows, but a quick clearing of background apps fixes that. For those who want to buy this phone for casual multimedia consumption, day-to-day social media use and messaging, the Honor 9N will not disappoint., Camera
The Honor 9N comes with dual cameras on the back, with a 13+2 Megapixel configuration. The secondary camera is a depth-sensing unit with an aperture of f/0.95 to aid in portrait-mode shots and as it turns out, Honor has really been refining this technology over every iteration. In my use, I found the portrait mode shots to be rather well processed. I could adjust the “virtual aperture” which would determine the intensity of the bokeh effect. While f/0.95 made things look a little too artificial, aperture values between f/1.8 and f2.8 gave the best results., For using the camera in the daytime, there’s little to complain. The colours are rich, the focus is surprisingly quick, and there’s no shutter lag. There is, however, a fraction of a second’s gap before you can take the second photo. The colours and contrast are good, and the dynamic range is fairly okay, but don’t expect wonders. The highlights blow out quickly when shooting in harsh lighting. I ended up testing the camera while it was mostly cloudy, with occasional sun, so the samples I ended up getting are on the much nicer side. There is no OIS however, the EIS does manage to help a little in getting the perfect shot. The one fault with the Honor 9N’s camera would be the aggressive JPG compression algorithm which saves space by sacrificing detail. It is difficult to get a texture-rich image due to the way the camera processes the image. However, this is a consistent problem with most smartphones, even most of the high-end ones., , In low light, the camera does rather poorly. The ISO tops out at ISO 2500 and the f/2.2 aperture on the secondary lens makes the camera hit its limits very quickly. I noticed that while taking a photo of a flower lit by street lights, the camera was just not able to push the exposure any higher and all I could get was an underexposed photo. In this shot, not only are the details completely missing, but noise is visible as well. I ventured out and took some more night time photos (and selfies) and noted that the low light performance of the Honor 9N is just barely passable, at best., , I shot my bookcase in both good light and poor light to see how the camera sensor recreates colour, noise and just how much dynamic range its able to capture. While the good light photo was predictably good, the low light shot showed a significantly reduced dynamic range, but also a loss in sharpness and colour accuracy. The sensor in the Honor 9N is just not able to keep up with low light situations., 
Go to our Flickr Gallery here to see the full-res image, Now let’s move over to the16-megapixel front-facing camera. In good light and in portrait mode (yes, there is one), the Honor 9N produces photos that I wouldn’t actually mind using as my profile photo (IF I was on Facebook, which I am not). They are fairly impressive, with the same kind of contrast and colour reproduction as seen on the primary camera. A few people who I sent the selfie to asked me if I had shot it on my Google Pixel 2 XL (for fairness sake, these people are not tech-savvy at all). The low light performance of the camera, however, isn’t stellar. Selfies quickly develop noise and once again, the ISO tops out at ISO 2500. Using the screen-simulated flash does help a little, but I wouldn’t say that it’s the best solution out there, especially if you’re taking a group selfie., , Overall, the Honor 9N offers decent day-time camera performance but as a low light shooter, does disappoint because it is not able to push the exposure any farther than ISO 2500 and shutter speed of 1/12th of a second, which is weird because if you switch over to the Pro Mode, the camera supports a shutterspeed of up to 8 seconds. Hopefully, Honor can address this issue with a software update in the future, along with adding RAW capture., You can view all the full resolution images from the Honor 9N in my flickr gallery here., Battery Life
The Honor 9N comes packing a 3000mAh battery and a standard 10watt (5V, 2A) charger. The phone ran for about four and a half hours before PCMark crashed (this was towards the end of the test) and keeps crashing since. In my day to day usage, I am just barely squeezing out a day’s use. I take the phone off charge at 8 a.m. and have to plug it back in by 10 p.m. or put it on battery saver mode in case I’ve been out longer. My usage involves listening to about 3 hours of music, watching 2 episodes of my favourite show on Amazon Prime (the show is House, for whoever is interested) and juggling two email and Instagram accounts. Typically, I have got better battery life from phones with a similar battery capacity, so I was a little letdown. Plus, the lack of fast charging does pinch a little as the phone takes about 110 minutes to go from 0 to 100 percent charge. I do tend to leave both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on at all times, so you may be able to get a whole day’s worth of use out of the phone, but I wasn’t able to do that., Bottomline
The Honor 9N brings the Honor 10’s elegant design to a sub 15K price point, but the corners that have had to be cut are obvious. The build feels nice and light and while the back is made of glass, it feels more like clear plastic. The phone uses an older Kirin 659 chipset that just barely managed to deliver decent performance. Honor would have to work hard at ensuring that every system update rolled out from here on is focused on performance optimization. For the asking price of Rs. 13,999, the phone does offer good value when considering the full HD IPS LCD display and the camera. The other reason to consider buying the Honor 9N would be the selection of colours, which most other brands selling in this price bracket don’t offer, which is as far as this phone’s USPs go."

Unlike the Honor 10 which had a very seamless blend of the back with the metal frame, the Honor 9N feels like three distinct layers; the glass back and the glass front held together by the metal frame. The glass back feels more like polycarbonate, and the only thing wrong with it is that you might think the phone is sturdier than it actually is. I’ve had a bad experience with phones which have a glass back, so the included case in the box is a welcome addition. Honestly, the use of glass on smartphones which don’t have wireless charging makes little sense since it makes the phone more prone to damage than their metal counterparts. The fingerprint sensor sits on the back of the device instead of being on the front chin. The placement of the fingerprint sensor is a very personal choice, as I prefer it on the front, while many prefer it to be on the back. Either way, it isn’t difficult to reach for one-handed operation., , The front of the phone has a 19:9 display and there’s not much else going on here in terms of design. The side frame has rounded edges with the volume rocker and power button on one side, and the SIM tray on the other. The headphone jack, speaker grille and MicroUSB charging port are all at the bottom., , Overall, it is nice to see Honor take design cues from the Honor 10 and bring them to a cheaper smartphone. The phone feels very light to hold, the glass back feels more like polycarbonate, but is extremely glossy and hence prone to fingerprints. This is again where the included case comes in handy. The case has a frosted finish and will hide the colour of your phone. Overall, the Honor 9N is a well-built device for its price., Display
The Honor 9N comes with an FHD+ 19:9 display. The 2280x1080 pixels are fit into a 5.8-inch display, giving it an effective pixel density of roughly 432ppi, a sufficiently high number by most standards. The smartphone has an IPS-LCD display which means excellent colour reproduction and very impressive viewing angles. The notch is supposed to offer more real estate but still remains a hotly debated design choice, as it seems to take away just as much as it offers. The phone isn’t bezel-less as it has very miniscule bezels on the side, and a notable chin at the bottom used for branding., In my use, I found the Honor 9N’s display to be rather impressive. The Full HD resolution obviously makes things look good. A peak brightness of 184 nits (631 lux) makes the display very legible. Outdoors, the display retains its saturation, but the reflective display does make it difficult to watch movies, although you should be able to browse the web and respond to texts without much trouble., , At night time while reading a book on the phone, it was nice to be able to turn the brightness down to 1 nit, a very comfortable level of illumination for reading in pitch darkness. While there is a blue light filter, the display settings also give users the ability to tune the colour tint manually, alongside a standard “warm” and “cool” display setting. Unfortunately, there is no way to tune the saturation of the display., Overall, the display of the Honor 9N is extremely functional, with good saturation levels right out of the box. The ability to tune the white balance of the display is nice, but a lack of saturation control could be bothersome. While the Honor 9N’s display is well balanced, those who like their display saturation to be higher than normal would not be pleased with the lack of an ability to fine tune this aspect of the display. The whole point of the new 19:9 aspect ratio is to be able to offer bezel-less displays, however, the Honor 9N keeps the bezels, no matter how narrow they may be., Performance
The Honor 9N is powered by the Kirin 695 chipset and our review unit is the 4GB RAM variant with 64GB storage. Huawei, Honor’s parent company, recently announced GPU Turbo, a feature that the company will roll out through a software update to boost the performance pushed out by the GPU while gaming. This feature is coming to many Huawei and Honor phones and is currently not available for the Honor 9N. It is, however, expected later this year via a software update. As of now, we’ve got the Kirin 659 which is a Snapdragon 625-grade SoC and 4GB of RAM to power the phone., In our benchmarks, the phone does not fare very well. It scored 184 in the GFX Bench Car Chase test and 936 in the Geekbench Single Core test. The Honor 9N’s 3DMark Sling Shot score was 284 while the 3D Mark Ice Storm score was 12500. These numbers show that the Honor 9N isn’t exactly the gaming beast you would want it to be. We explored this further in our gaming sessions with the phone., , I played four games on the phone; Asphalt Extreme, Shadowgun Legends, PUBG and Subway Surfers. Asphalt Extreme plays smooth, but there is a visibly lower number of particle effects. While driving through dirt or water, you will notice the water (or the dirt) that is kicked up by the tyres look more like square blobs than the real thing. When playing the same game on higher-end devices, these textures are much nicer and much more well defined. The gameplay itself isn’t too problematic, with everything working smoothly. Playing PUBG on the phone, the load times were noticeably slow and the textures weren’t as visually appealing, then again, the gameplay was pretty smooth. Taking aim with and without the sights was once again stutter-free. Shadowgun Legends is where I found the most lag, both during missions and in the lobby. The stutters weren’t excessive for the most part, but at times when the map had too many opponents, things became very slow and hence, the game became too slow to play properly., , Moving onto day-to-day performance, the phone manages to do fairly well. Between the 15+ tabs in Google Chrome, Play Store, Gmail, navigation and the handful of messaging apps, the Honor 9N manages to deliver a decent experience. When there was a game left running in the background, the phone tended to stutter a little while switching windows, but a quick clearing of background apps fixes that. For those who want to buy this phone for casual multimedia consumption, day-to-day social media use and messaging, the Honor 9N will not disappoint., Camera
The Honor 9N comes with dual cameras on the back, with a 13+2 Megapixel configuration. The secondary camera is a depth-sensing unit with an aperture of f/0.95 to aid in portrait-mode shots and as it turns out, Honor has really been refining this technology over every iteration. In my use, I found the portrait mode shots to be rather well processed. I could adjust the “virtual aperture” which would determine the intensity of the bokeh effect. While f/0.95 made things look a little too artificial, aperture values between f/1.8 and f2.8 gave the best results., For using the camera in the daytime, there’s little to complain. The colours are rich, the focus is surprisingly quick, and there’s no shutter lag. There is, however, a fraction of a second’s gap before you can take the second photo. The colours and contrast are good, and the dynamic range is fairly okay, but don’t expect wonders. The highlights blow out quickly when shooting in harsh lighting. I ended up testing the camera while it was mostly cloudy, with occasional sun, so the samples I ended up getting are on the much nicer side. There is no OIS however, the EIS does manage to help a little in getting the perfect shot. The one fault with the Honor 9N’s camera would be the aggressive JPG compression algorithm which saves space by sacrificing detail. It is difficult to get a texture-rich image due to the way the camera processes the image. However, this is a consistent problem with most smartphones, even most of the high-end ones., , In low light, the camera does rather poorly. The ISO tops out at ISO 2500 and the f/2.2 aperture on the secondary lens makes the camera hit its limits very quickly. I noticed that while taking a photo of a flower lit by street lights, the camera was just not able to push the exposure any higher and all I could get was an underexposed photo. In this shot, not only are the details completely missing, but noise is visible as well. I ventured out and took some more night time photos (and selfies) and noted that the low light performance of the Honor 9N is just barely passable, at best., , I shot my bookcase in both good light and poor light to see how the camera sensor recreates colour, noise and just how much dynamic range its able to capture. While the good light photo was predictably good, the low light shot showed a significantly reduced dynamic range, but also a loss in sharpness and colour accuracy. The sensor in the Honor 9N is just not able to keep up with low light situations., 
Go to our Flickr Gallery here to see the full-res image, Now let’s move over to the16-megapixel front-facing camera. In good light and in portrait mode (yes, there is one), the Honor 9N produces photos that I wouldn’t actually mind using as my profile photo (IF I was on Facebook, which I am not). They are fairly impressive, with the same kind of contrast and colour reproduction as seen on the primary camera. A few people who I sent the selfie to asked me if I had shot it on my Google Pixel 2 XL (for fairness sake, these people are not tech-savvy at all). The low light performance of the camera, however, isn’t stellar. Selfies quickly develop noise and once again, the ISO tops out at ISO 2500. Using the screen-simulated flash does help a little, but I wouldn’t say that it’s the best solution out there, especially if you’re taking a group selfie., , Overall, the Honor 9N offers decent day-time camera performance but as a low light shooter, does disappoint because it is not able to push the exposure any farther than ISO 2500 and shutter speed of 1/12th of a second, which is weird because if you switch over to the Pro Mode, the camera supports a shutterspeed of up to 8 seconds. Hopefully, Honor can address this issue with a software update in the future, along with adding RAW capture., You can view all the full resolution images from the Honor 9N in my flickr gallery here., Battery Life
The Honor 9N comes packing a 3000mAh battery and a standard 10watt (5V, 2A) charger. The phone ran for about four and a half hours before PCMark crashed (this was towards the end of the test) and keeps crashing since. In my day to day usage, I am just barely squeezing out a day’s use. I take the phone off charge at 8 a.m. and have to plug it back in by 10 p.m. or put it on battery saver mode in case I’ve been out longer. My usage involves listening to about 3 hours of music, watching 2 episodes of my favourite show on Amazon Prime (the show is House, for whoever is interested) and juggling two email and Instagram accounts. Typically, I have got better battery life from phones with a similar battery capacity, so I was a little letdown. Plus, the lack of fast charging does pinch a little as the phone takes about 110 minutes to go from 0 to 100 percent charge. I do tend to leave both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on at all times, so you may be able to get a whole day’s worth of use out of the phone, but I wasn’t able to do that., Bottomline
The Honor 9N brings the Honor 10’s elegant design to a sub 15K price point, but the corners that have had to be cut are obvious. The build feels nice and light and while the back is made of glass, it feels more like clear plastic. The phone uses an older Kirin 659 chipset that just barely managed to deliver decent performance. Honor would have to work hard at ensuring that every system update rolled out from here on is focused on performance optimization. For the asking price of Rs. 13,999, the phone does offer good value when considering the full HD IPS LCD display and the camera. The other reason to consider buying the Honor 9N would be the selection of colours, which most other brands selling in this price bracket don’t offer, which is as far as this phone’s USPs go."

It comes at a higher price, but that’s how the offline market usually goes. , , Build and Design, For the most part, this is the K6 Power with a new name. It’s slightly thinner, but heavier. It also has a larger screen that makes it slightly bigger. Aesthetically, though, the Lenovo K6 Note is exactly the same as the K6 Power., , , The round camera module and fingerprint sensor look the same. It has the same metal finish on the body. We got the grey variants of both the devices and they’re practically the same., The K6 Note is wider. That makes it less suitable for single-handed usage. Adding 6mm to the width feels like more than it sounds. Your thumb won’t really reach the other side of the screen. However, the power button and volume rocker rest comfortably beneath your thumb. You will also feel the added 14 grams in weight. The K6 Note weighs 169 grams, to the Power’s 145 grams., , Display, As mentioned above, the K6 Note has a larger display, but with the same resolution. The 5.5 inch 1080p display looks decent for a budget device. Considering the phones you buy offline otherwise, this is a good deal. In the larger scheme of things, however, including phones found online, there are loopholes., For example, while 401 ppi is sharp enough, this display is dimmer than ideal. Maximum luminance comes to 573 Lux and sunlight visibility is not the best. Colours look reasonably pleasant, but not punchy or vibrant. There also seems to be some light leak near the edges, which is disappointing from a phone in this day and age., Performance, As with its predecessor, the K6 Note runs on the Snapdragon 430. The eight Cortex A53 cores makes for a efficient, but not very powerful combination. Needless to say, the Lenovo K6 Note is more focused on battery life than raw power., , , In practice, this makes it feel somewhat sluggish. Navigating around the UI or multi-tasking feel a little slow. The K6 Note isn’t as snappy as you would like. Yet, it’s able enough to manage regular tasks, like social networking and IMs., That said, it all felt snappier on the K6 Power. There are slight stutters after extended usage. After filling the phone up and putting it through long periods of gaming and video recording, it showed some noticeable frame drops., , , As with most Snapdragon 430-powered phones, temperatures on the body remain reasonable. It tops out at 37 degrees after 15 minutes of gaming, but Lenovo limits the video recording capabilities to 1080p, perhaps because the SD430 isn’t powerful enough to manage good 4k recording. We tried other apps for 4K recording too, but the right APIs aren’t supported on this phone. It’s disappointing, but not unacceptable., When the K6 Note was announced, the fact that it was more accessible (being sold offline) would have made all this reasonable. However, the Coolpad Cool 1, launched recently, does everything this one does, only better. And that phone is also available offline., Camera, The K6 Note has a 16MP camera, but it is disappointing. Noise levels are high, irrespective of the light. It doesn’t do very well with  white balance either, and under low light, details are hardly worth writing home about. The biggest problem with the K6 Note is that the camera depends on the user's judgement. If you don't focus on the most balanced area on the scene, your photos will almost always be blow out. Highlights are clipped 90% of the time and that too really badly. Images are never really usable, be it for social media sharing, or otherwise. On our tests, this is one of the weakest cameras that we've seen over all of 2016., Overall, the 16MP camera is not satisfactory and nowhere close to the Nubia Z11 Mini, Coolpad Cool 1 or Honor 6X., Battery, We mentioned in the performance section that the K6 Note is a battery-focused phone. It has a 4000 mAh battery, and combined with the Snapdragon 430, it lasts quite long., Idle battery life is quite decent, while the phone easily manages 14 odd hours of regular usage. That makes for just over a work day’s worth of battery life. With 100% charge at 11am, the phone got us through till 1am, with 5% battery left. That includes lots of social networking and IMs, about half an hour playing Asphalt 8, 20 minutes playing Amazing Spiderman 2, and some shots using the camera., Bottomline, The Lenovo K6 Note is not the best smartphone out there. With devices like the Coolpad Cool 1 available, it makes little sense to buy the K6 Note, even if you need something from the offline market. Most manufacturers are taking note of the offline space now, and while the Coolpad Cool 1 is already a much better device available offline, you could even wait a few months for more options to make it to the market., If you’re hard pressed for a phone and can’t get your hands on the Cool 1, Honor 6X, Redmi Note 3 or Le 2, you could still buy this. You will compromise on the camera, though, even if you consider the other aspects reasonable."

However, it lacks performance, camera, and even the battery life expected from such a smartphone. It's not a recommendable smartphone., , They started at 2-2.5, but smartphone screens today are 5-inch or more. Some, like the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus blur the lines between phones and tablets. Companies are betting that you want a bigger screen. And on some level, it does make sense, because of apps like Netflix, Hotstar, YouTube and more., Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Interestingly, a big screen comes with baggage. Bigger screens are tougher on battery lives, they make rendering graphics more difficult, and create a need for higher resolution. Most importantly, a big screen needs to be impeccable, leaving little room for error., With that in mind, let’s consider the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus, and its gigantic 6.4-inch display., Display, There are some similarities between the Phab 2 Plus and Xiaomi Mi Max. Both these screens are dim, but the Phab 2 Plus is dimmer, with luminance readings of 469 Lux. While the Phab 2 Plus’ isn’t the brightest out there, its dimness also affects sunlight visibility. It also seems to have some light bleed issues near the edges, which further reduces the screen's attractiveness., , Interestingly, colour reproduction is quite respectable, as is 344 ppi pixel density. Black levels are good, and the display can produce a decently wide colour gamut., If this were a flagship we could perhaps demand a QHD screen, but 1080p works at this price. To the naked eye, it seems sharp enough as well. Viewing angles are also decent., But that’s just where the problem is. The decent display is easier to swallow when it isn’t this size. At 6.4-inch, the Phab 2 Plus’ screen feels underwhelming and plain. It’s not really what we want a from a phone with so much screen., Audio Quality, Dolby Atmos audio has been part of almost every Lenovo presentation recently. However, 360 degree surround sound seems to far fetched for smartphones, and the results speak for themselves. Confoundingly, the Phab 2 Plus has a single mono-speaker, which means you’re not even going to get stereo effects., , In the end, the Phab 2 Plus is incredibly loud, but doesn’t offer much by way of audio quality. Headphones are still your best friends for good audio quality on smartphones. In the case of the Phab 2 Plus, the in-box JBL earphones would work for casual listeners, unless you’re looking for good noise cancellation. Audiophiles, or those with more tuned ears will need to buy third-party headphones., Performance, In our in-depth overview of the Phab 2 Plus earlier, we found the phone to be slow. That remains the same after further testing. The MediaTek MT8783 SoC feels sluggish on regular performance, as well as gaming and multi-tasking.,  , , , , , The Phab 2 Plus is slow, doesn’t do well even under moderate loads and lags while gaming. The processor isn’t well suited for FHD gaming, with low frame rates. It is no match for the Snapdragon 650 and 652 in the Mi Max., Camera, Another important thing about the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus is its camera. The phone is the newest amongst a line of dual-camera devices being sold in India., It combines two 13MP camera sensors, and both laser and phase detection autofocus, to shoot photos. The second camera is used for depth perception, and some post processing., , In reality, though, there’s little to speak of here. The Phab 2 Plus is amongst the weakest camera phones we’ve reviewed this year. The dual-camera mode is turned off in auto mode, but even when using them, shots are below average. It doesn't create a true bokeh. Rather, the camera artificially blurs the background, and the results aren't anywhere close to ideal. In fact, we often preferred the background blue created without the dual-camera mode. The camera does perform better on close-up photos (minus the blur), though., , Close up photo with (above) and without (below) dual-camera., , Images, irrespective of what lights they’re clicked in, look dull and low on details. It doesn’t seem to make the best use of the depth information, either. When clicking indoors, fluorescent lights flare up and ruin photos. Under low light, the white balance is loft, creating a blue-ish hue on images., The phone focuses reasonably fast, but that too can slow down in unevenly lit conditions and low light. Processing can often be longer than ideal as well., Further, the Phab 2 Plus has an AR camera mode as well, but without the benefits of Google Tango. This AR camera is pretty much a gimmick. It allows you to put an animated dog, dragon, fairy or cat in a photo. While that can make for some fun photos, we see absolutely no practical benefits or value addition., Battery, Phone as big as the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus, usually have really long battery life. That’s because companies can pack a big battery pack within the device, and sure enough, Lenovo packs a 4050 mAh battery inside the Phab 2 Plus, although it’s big enough to hold an even bigger battery. And we can’t say that that wouldn’t have been a better idea., While PC Mark’s simulated battery test records 7 hours 45 minutes to bring the battery down from 80 percent to 20 percent, real world performance is not quite the same. On a single charge, the Phab 2 Plus got us through a work day, which is about 10-12 hours, but that’s about it. You would ideally need to charge this phone twice every day, with one full charge and one more to get you by. In the long run, this might reduce battery life even more since incomplete charges will eat up cycles., Build and Design, The only part of the Phab 2 Plus that we enjoyed is its build quality and design. The dual rear cameras are placed vertically on the back, with the flash and laser AF between them. With this, the Phab 2 Plus looks really unique, and combined with a golden unibody metallic finish, it feels solid and sturdy. The big screen also comes with really big bezels, which some may not like, but it doesn’t really hamper the looks, in our opinion., , , Of course, no one expects ergonomics at this size, and the Phab 2 Plus is both big and really heavy. However, for those looking for a phone this size, this works. The slight chamfers on the edges don’t dig into your hands, and the capacitive buttons on the front are backlit., Overall, the Phab 2 Plus makes for a pretty unique looking phone, thanks to its gigantic presence, and dual-cameras. , Bottomline, It’s disappointing that Lenovo hasn’t brought the Google Tango driven Phab 2 Pro to India. The Lenovo Phab 2 Plus is a device that needs a lot of work. It’s surpassed soundly, by the Xiaomi Mi Max, which incidentally is its chief and only real competitor as well. The Phab 2 Plus is slow, doesn’t have a display that a phone this size needs, and its battery life is decent at best."
2132,42,lg-q6-review-63781,0,0,2019-05-22,63781,Hardik Singh,LG Q6 Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/lg-q6-review-63781.html,"The LG Q6 is a phone with the Redmi 4’s hardware inside the LG G6’s body. It’s meant for those who put more stock in design than internal hardware specs., , The Indian smartphone market largely comprises of phones under the budget of Rs 15,000, and one doesn’t need to really explain why. The competition in this segment is fierce. The phones available in this segment offer everything one might ask for, including metal body, dual cameras, large battery packs, 4G VoLTE, 1080p displays, copious amount of RAM and storage, you name it. However, most reviewers (me included) agree that phone makers are not playing enough attention to design. In fact, I would say that all these budget smartphones look rather dull and boring. The reasons for that can be many but the fact of the matter is, all phones majorly look the same. , LG V40 ThinQ Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Amidst this horde of identicals LG has brought the Q6 to India, which I believe is amongst the best looking budget smartphone of all time. It carries the same Full Vision display we enjoyed on the LG G6, that made it a conversation starter every time I took the phone out of my pocket. However, as they say, “looks aren't everything”. To find out more about the phone, I dug deeper and here is what I found., , Display and Design
First and foremost I must address the display on this device. I believe most of you would agree with me that the LG Q6 is a looker. Kudos to LG for bringing their flagship tech to the budget segment, reaching a wider audience range than flagships do. As you must have heard, LG calls this a Full Vision display. Essentially, the display is a little taller than the standard 1080p resolution. It rocks a 2160 x 1080p resolution, which takes the aspect ratio from the standard 16:9 to 18:9. In tandem, the top and bottom bezels have been drastically minimised, which adds to the phone’s unique look. Moreover, the Full Vision display not only makes the phone look good, but makes the whole footprint smaller. This means, the LG Q6 with its 5.5-inch display, is just a hair bigger than the 5-inch Lenovo Z2 Plus., , (L-R) OnePlus 5, LG Q6 - both have 5.5-inch displays, As for the display quality, it is a top notch panel and can easily be regarded as one of the best in the category. Viewing angles are very good and the colour saturation, though a bit warm, is favourable for viewing all kinds of content. It is easily viewable outdoors and under direct sunlight, and with luminance readings of 605 lux, offers ample brightness as well. The display has Gorilla Glass 3 protection on top for scratch protection and the touch response is quite good., , What I did find a little disappointing is the fact that not a lot of apps can make use of the extra screen space made available on this phone. However, LG is a still an early adopter of the screen resolution and as more phones join the bunch, developers will also start implementing the screen resolution in their respective apps., Complementing the display is the overall design of the device, which makes the Q6 look like a miniaturised version of the G6. the metal side rails, along with the glossy plastic back give the phone an upmarket look. It is well weighted and quite ergonomic for the screen size it offers., Build quality
While the display makes the phone enticing, it also adds a sense of fragility. LG claims that its H-beam chassis is more than capable of handling those occasional bumps and drops. The frame itself is made out of 7000 series aluminium, which marketing jargon will tell you is an aerospace grade material. Although, to put it relatively, that has been used in smartphones for ages., , Claims aside, I have been using the phone for a few days now and it does feel quite sturdy in hand. The edges are metallic and rounded, which makes the phone easier to grip. While Gorilla Glass 3 protects the display from scratches, the plastic back gets scratched quite easily. The Gorilla Glass 3 display is also flat and not curved. LG says that it has done so to “reduce annoying accidental touches”, you get in a phone with a curved display. However, I don't agree with that argument., UI and features
LG hasn't changed its UI significantly in terms of design and functionality since the LG G6. So, you still get a very colourful interface with no app drawer. LG tries to ease the user into the UI from the very beginning, with tutorials and pop-cards for almost all aspects and functions of the device. It will give you pop-ups to explain what you should do if your phone becomes unresponsive by chance or how you can add a fourth shortcut in the navigation panel at the bottom. , , In addition, LG has duplicate apps for almost all Google apps, which seems unnecessary. These apps not only take up space, but will slow down the update process in the long run. This is due to the fact that like any other company, LG will bring Android O to its flagships first and then to other phones., Coming back to the phone at hand, I am disappointed to see that the device does not feature a fingerprint scanner. However, the Q6 comes with a “face unlock” feature, that works, but is a little slow for my liking. , Performance
While the face unlock is slow, the performance of the phone itself is slower. Powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 SoC and 3GB of RAM, the LG Q6 can barely keep up with the competition on synthetic benchmarks. That being said, if you are not into heavy gaming or don’t use processor intensive tasks, such as video editing apps, then you would find the overall experience of the phone good enough. You can have multiple (more than 20) apps in the task manager, download videos on Amazon Prime in the background and watch or stream YouTube videos at the same time, without the phone stuttering. , , , , The only time I had issues with the performance was when I played games like Injustice 2 and Vainglory on it. The phone kept stuttering and one could see noticeable frame drops throughout the gameplay. At the same time, you can try games like Daddy Long Legs and Card Thief, which just about work fine., 4G connectivity is also good and the Q6 supports dual VoLTE SIM cards slots. It also features a dedicated external memory card slot in extension to the 32GB internal storage. The speaker on the back side could have been louder, but I do find the audio quality via headphones decent., Battery life
The LG Q6 brings a 3000mAh battery to the table, which is good enough for normal users. Using the phone as a daily driver I found that its battery is highly efficient and maintains its battery life quite well, even if you indulge in watching YouTube videos a lot. There is even a “game battery saver” mode, which adjusts the battery consumption and extend battery life. Although, that is something you won't need, as you can’t really game on the phone. The device scored 5 hours and 1 minutes on the PCMark benchmark, which isn't exceptional, but still workable, as the phone lasts a day easily even if you’re a heavy user., , Camera
Like the battery life, the rear 13MP camera on the LG Q6 is also just about good enough. Images taken in all lighting conditions look rather subdued, but have ample details and sharpness. Images do tend to be grainy, as you move to low light settings, but most images do look usable. I believe the camera could have achieved more with a manual mode, but LG has kept the camera app very lackluster. Apart from panorama and food mode, the phone doesn't really let you tweak settings further. , , , , There are the usual filters and you can switch between auto mode or LG’s own square mode, which it introduced with the G6. The front facing 5MP camera also has the wide angle and normal selfie camera modes, taken from the G6. The image quality here is again just good enough, with softer focus, cleaning blemishes and dark spots. There is a skin tone slider as well, but unless you are outside in ample light conditions, the camera won’t do justice to your face or skin tone in selfies. Needless to say, selfies in low light or even under incandescent light are just not good enough., Bottomline
This brings us to our conclusion of the LG Q6 review, which makes me both happy and sad. I am happy that LG finally took it upon itself to change how budget segment smartphones should look. The Q6 now sets the precedent for how a sub-15K smartphone or anything around this price should be designed. At the same time, I am somewhat disappointed that the performance of the Q6 is somewhat disappointing and sub-par compared to our recommended choices. The phones especially lacks the gaming prowess we have now accustomed ourselves to in the sub-15K smartphone category., As to answer the burning question, yes, the LG Q6 is recommendable phone if and only if you are not a very heavy user. The phone offers a brilliant display, a usable camera, is well built and has decent battery life as well., How it compares?
The LG Q6 goes against the likes of Moto G5 Plus, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, Honor 6X, Samsung Galaxy On Max and more. All these smartphones offer better gaming performance, but offers pretty much the same day-to-day performance. At the same time, the Q6 is also not pushing any boundaries when it comes to camera quality or battery life. All things considered, the LG Q6 is an all rounder. It a jack of all trades, but master of none. It’s better designed than any sub-20k smartphone though."
2267,42,nokia-6-1-review-131171,0,0,2019-05-22,131171,Subhrojit Mallick,Nokia 6.1 Plus Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/nokia-6-1-review-131171.html,"The Nokia 6.1 Plus is a capable mid-ranger that ticks all the boxes when it comes to the trending features in smartphones of 2018. It’s closest rival is the Redmi Note 5 Pro which also runs on the same hardware. The choice comes down to whether you prefer a stock Android interface or custom MIUI. However, an underwhelming camera makes it difficult to recommend this phone over other more capable devices in that price range. The 6.1 Plus is a performance enthusiast’s phone of choice, one who wants a no-nonsense offering that gets the job done. If you have a knack for photography though, the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Xiaomi Mi A2 are what you should be looking at., , HMD Global’s Nokia may be just two years into its reawakening, but it’s already embracing the latest trends like a bezel-less display and dual cameras. Take the new Nokia 6.1 Plus that launched today in India for instance. It’s the first Nokia phone with a notched display, marking a departure from the design cues seen in its predecessors. There’s also a capable mid-range chipset, Android One certification, dual cameras and a compact form factor, that makes it all the more interesting. However, with stalwarts like the Redmi Note 5 Pro ruling the market in that price range, will the Nokia 6.1 Plus be worth your money? Let’s find out., Nokia 7.1 64GB Review, Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, The Nokia 6.1 Plus is a departure from the design philosophy Nokia settled into with the previous offerings in the mid-range segment. Gone is the copper lining and the sturdy metal build. Instead, the 6.1 Plus takes inspiration from the Nokia 8 Sirocco to offer a glass sandwich design housed within a thick, sturdy aluminum frame. It isn’t the slimmest phone out there, but it’s comfortably compact. I could almost reach the other end of the display with just one hand, so someone with larger hands will have no problem using it single-handedly. The glass on the back and the front is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3. Despite that, I would still recommend a case as glass bodies generally tend to crack easily., On the back, the dual camera unit is centrally placed and has raised contours around it, much like the Nokia 8 Sirocco. The fingerprint sensor is placed right below and I had no problems locating it with my finger. We received the black variant of the phone for review which has stainless steel accents around the camera and the buttons. That renders a premium feel to it., , Up front is an all new notched display. New for Nokia, that is. This is the first time the company is trying out the in-vogue design and depending on which side of the notch debate you are in, you either like it or hate it. The size of the notch is relatively smaller than what other phones have. It houses only the front camera and the ear-piece, which makes me wonder perhaps the notch was simply about trying something new. It doesn’t serve a specific purpose other than allowing a 5.8-inch panel fit into a 5.8-inch body. There are also significant bezels on the bottom and thin ones on the sides. I wouldn’t call it the most immersive display by any means., , The panel on the Nokia 6.1 Plus seems functional at best. The extra 0.3-inch space is taken by the notched area that houses the notifications icons, clock and the likes. You can, of course, hide the notch in the Settings but that takes away the extra real estate. However, while playing videos on YouTube and Netflix, the content adapted itself to the notch, using only 5.5-inch of space leaving the rest darkened. Since this is an LCD panel, the blacking out of the notch isn’t as prominent as phones with AMOLED panels and is quite visible., The content on the screen is quite bright and vibrant. In fact, that’s almost the same with every phone in that price range these days. I streamed a few episodes of the Crown on Netflix and was quite impressed by the colours. While streaming, I realised this isn’t a video-consumer’s phone. The real estate is just too small to enjoy an action-packed episode fully. Although, if you have to watch something on the metro during rush hour, it’s compact size gives you a good grip., Nokia gives you the option to turn on night light and adaptive brightness. There’s also the option to turn on ‘ambient display’, that discreetly lights up the screen when there’s a new notification., The display is the highlight of the Nokia 6.1 Plus’ design and while it definitely looks good, the compact size of it may not be up to everyone’s taste., The earlier Nokia 6 phones were criticised for lacking horsepower in the performance segment. The first Nokia 6 came with an entry-level 4-series Snapdragon processor, while the Nokia 6.1 came with a Snapdragon 630 that was easily outperformed by the Snapdragon 636 in the Redmi Note 5 Pro. The Nokia 6.1 Plus, thus, takes no chances. It is also powered by the Snapdragon 636 that uses Kryo cores clocked at 1.8GHz coupled with an Adreno 509 GPU and 4GB of RAM. There’s 64GB of storage to go along with it, with the option to expand it via a microSD card. Although, you have to choose between an expandable storage and a second SIM card., The point to note in this case is that even though the Nokia 6.1 Plus runs on the Snapdragon 636 which was so far the fastest chipset in the mid-range segment, the Mi A2 and the Honor Play with the top-of-the-line Snapdragon 660 and flagship Kirin 970 SoC sort of spoil the party for Nokia. But that’s something only speed enthusiasts will look into. For an average user, the Snapdragon 636 is perfectly capable in handling day-to-day tasks. The benchmark reports confirm that., , , On AnTuTu, the Nokia 6.1 Plus scored 116079 against Redmi Note 5 Pro’s 112652, while on Geekbench Single and Multi Core tests, it received 1330 and 4920 respectively, as against RN5 Pro’s 1326 and 4971. As for Graphics, the 3D Mark Slingshot test gives a score of 1466. All this show that the Nokia 6.1 Plus is right up there with the best-selling phone in that segment., Add to that the simplicity of pure, stock Android and the Nokia 6.1 Plus becomes a good alternative to those who don’t prefer MIUI. In real world usage, the 6.1 Plus is fast and snappy. There weren’t any noticeable lags or slowdowns and apps launched with the expected waiting time of around 2-3 seconds. This is an Android One Certified phone which means you will receive regular security updates along with a promised upgrade to Android 9 Pie when it becomes available., While day-to-day tasks like browsing, shooting, social media and the likes performed without much of a hitch, gaming isn’t all that good on this phone. High-end games like PubG Mobile ran on medium graphics with some frame-drops. For a casual gamer though, this shouldn’t be a problem., The Nokia 6.1 Plus comes across as a phone not for enthusiasts, but for those looking for a reliable performer. It certainly won’t thrill the speed-seeker, but if you are looking for a well-rounded, dependable, compact performer, the 6.1 is a good option., The Nokia 6.1 Plus comes with a dual camera unit at the back. The primary 12MP sensor has an aperture of f/2.0, 1um pixel pitch and PDAF while the secondary 5MP sensor with aperture f/2.4 is used for depth-sensing. Up front is a 16MP camera with f/2.0 aperture for selfies., , Feature wise, the 6.1 Plus can take portrait shots, bothies (of course!), UHD 4K videos and more. However, this does not use the Pro Camera app like the Nokia 6.1 and the 7 Plus does. The camera app on the Nokia 6.1 Plus is quite cluttered as a result, with big icons taking up space in the viewfinder. The options are also quite confusing to search as you only see the icons and no text whatsoever. It has in-built beauty effects powered by machine learning, something that most OEMs have been dabbling with for some time., Daylight, , With ample light, the camera of the Nokia 6.1 Plus gives good results. It focuses quickly but there is a slight shutter lag, which means you have to keep your hands steady. The results come off sharp and saturated. It’s not clear whether the AI imaging is working because there’s no way to turn it on or off. Like most phones, the Nokia 6.1 Plus is quite capable of shooting pleasing daylight shots., Indoors, , When focus was on the books, , When focus was on the light, The weakness becomes apparent when shooting indoors. The camera takes some time to focus and there is significant shutter lag, which combined with a lack of stabilisation, means one needs to have very steady hands. Furthermore, focusing on a source of light will darken the entire frame almost completely. The resulting shot when the exposure is just about right isn’t all that desirable though. It’s hazy and lacks sharpness., Low Light, , Low-light photography is the most difficult aspect for OEMs to nail and the Nokia 6.1 Plus seems to be no different. An aperture of f/2.0 means the shutter needs to be open for longer and that calls for steady hands again. There’s lesser noise though, but parts of the frame which are dark don’t have any detail at all., Portrait, , The portrait mode of the Nokia 6.1 Plus uses the secondary sensor for depth information. You can also control the amount of background blur in the frame while shooting. The camera could detect objects that are behind the object under focus and blur them out accordingly. The bokeh is not as aggressive as we have seen in Honor phones, but the resulting shot lacks the sharpness that one sees in the Redmi Note 5 Pro., Selfies, , The front camera of the phone is the same 16MP sensor at the back. It takes decently well-detailed selfies that are sharp and saturated. There’s a beauty mode that removes marks and blemishes from your face, but I would recommend shooting with that turned off for better results., , The Nokia 6.1 Plus comes with a 3,060mAh battery that is underwhelming, to say the least. In the mid-range segment, a powerful battery is a big factor in convincing buyers. It seems, in its bid to offer a compact design, Nokia had to sacrifice long battery life from the phone. In our PCMark Work 2.0 test, the phone received a rating of 5 hours 10 minutes, which is just about average. In real life, the phone will last just about a typical work day that starts at 9 AM till 7 PM. During my time with the phone, I used it to take photos, browse social media and play games (for about 30 minutes), after which I had to plug it in for charge., The Nokia 6.1 Plus comes off as a potential alternative to the best-selling Redmi Note 5 Pro. With similar hardware powering the two, the choice comes down to the software and user interface one is comfortable using. The Nokia 6.1 Plus is also more compact, making it easy to hold and use. It’s camera, however, is a tad underwhelming and cannot hold a candle to the likes of the Redmi Note 5 Pro or the Xiaomi Mi A2. The Xiaomi Mi A2, in fact, comes off as a better alternative for stock Android lovers. Get the Nokia 6.1 Plus if the Xiaomi Mi A2 is out of stock, which should happen often considering Xiaomi’s track record."

The benchmark reports confirm that., , , On AnTuTu, the Nokia 6.1 Plus scored 116079 against Redmi Note 5 Pro’s 112652, while on Geekbench Single and Multi Core tests, it received 1330 and 4920 respectively, as against RN5 Pro’s 1326 and 4971. As for Graphics, the 3D Mark Slingshot test gives a score of 1466. All this show that the Nokia 6.1 Plus is right up there with the best-selling phone in that segment., Add to that the simplicity of pure, stock Android and the Nokia 6.1 Plus becomes a good alternative to those who don’t prefer MIUI. In real world usage, the 6.1 Plus is fast and snappy. There weren’t any noticeable lags or slowdowns and apps launched with the expected waiting time of around 2-3 seconds. This is an Android One Certified phone which means you will receive regular security updates along with a promised upgrade to Android 9 Pie when it becomes available., While day-to-day tasks like browsing, shooting, social media and the likes performed without much of a hitch, gaming isn’t all that good on this phone. High-end games like PubG Mobile ran on medium graphics with some frame-drops. For a casual gamer though, this shouldn’t be a problem., The Nokia 6.1 Plus comes across as a phone not for enthusiasts, but for those looking for a reliable performer. It certainly won’t thrill the speed-seeker, but if you are looking for a well-rounded, dependable, compact performer, the 6.1 is a good option., The Nokia 6.1 Plus comes with a dual camera unit at the back. The primary 12MP sensor has an aperture of f/2.0, 1um pixel pitch and PDAF while the secondary 5MP sensor with aperture f/2.4 is used for depth-sensing. Up front is a 16MP camera with f/2.0 aperture for selfies., , Feature wise, the 6.1 Plus can take portrait shots, bothies (of course!), UHD 4K videos and more. However, this does not use the Pro Camera app like the Nokia 6.1 and the 7 Plus does. The camera app on the Nokia 6.1 Plus is quite cluttered as a result, with big icons taking up space in the viewfinder. The options are also quite confusing to search as you only see the icons and no text whatsoever. It has in-built beauty effects powered by machine learning, something that most OEMs have been dabbling with for some time., Daylight, , With ample light, the camera of the Nokia 6.1 Plus gives good results. It focuses quickly but there is a slight shutter lag, which means you have to keep your hands steady. The results come off sharp and saturated. It’s not clear whether the AI imaging is working because there’s no way to turn it on or off. Like most phones, the Nokia 6.1 Plus is quite capable of shooting pleasing daylight shots., Indoors, , When focus was on the books, , When focus was on the light, The weakness becomes apparent when shooting indoors. The camera takes some time to focus and there is significant shutter lag, which combined with a lack of stabilisation, means one needs to have very steady hands. Furthermore, focusing on a source of light will darken the entire frame almost completely. The resulting shot when the exposure is just about right isn’t all that desirable though. It’s hazy and lacks sharpness., Low Light, , Low-light photography is the most difficult aspect for OEMs to nail and the Nokia 6.1 Plus seems to be no different. An aperture of f/2.0 means the shutter needs to be open for longer and that calls for steady hands again. There’s lesser noise though, but parts of the frame which are dark don’t have any detail at all., Portrait, , The portrait mode of the Nokia 6.1 Plus uses the secondary sensor for depth information. You can also control the amount of background blur in the frame while shooting. The camera could detect objects that are behind the object under focus and blur them out accordingly. The bokeh is not as aggressive as we have seen in Honor phones, but the resulting shot lacks the sharpness that one sees in the Redmi Note 5 Pro., Selfies, , The front camera of the phone is the same 16MP sensor at the back. It takes decently well-detailed selfies that are sharp and saturated. There’s a beauty mode that removes marks and blemishes from your face, but I would recommend shooting with that turned off for better results., , The Nokia 6.1 Plus comes with a 3,060mAh battery that is underwhelming, to say the least. In the mid-range segment, a powerful battery is a big factor in convincing buyers. It seems, in its bid to offer a compact design, Nokia had to sacrifice long battery life from the phone. In our PCMark Work 2.0 test, the phone received a rating of 5 hours 10 minutes, which is just about average. In real life, the phone will last just about a typical work day that starts at 9 AM till 7 PM. During my time with the phone, I used it to take photos, browse social media and play games (for about 30 minutes), after which I had to plug it in for charge., The Nokia 6.1 Plus comes off as a potential alternative to the best-selling Redmi Note 5 Pro. With similar hardware powering the two, the choice comes down to the software and user interface one is comfortable using. The Nokia 6.1 Plus is also more compact, making it easy to hold and use. It’s camera, however, is a tad underwhelming and cannot hold a candle to the likes of the Redmi Note 5 Pro or the Xiaomi Mi A2. The Xiaomi Mi A2, in fact, comes off as a better alternative for stock Android lovers. Get the Nokia 6.1 Plus if the Xiaomi Mi A2 is out of stock, which should happen often considering Xiaomi’s track record."
,,nokia-x5-review-134400,0,0,2019-05-22,134400,Vignesh Giridharan,Nokia 5.1 Plus (Nokia X5) Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/nokia-x5-review-134400.html,"The Nokia 5.1 Plus is an acceptable substitute for those who don’t want to spend those few extra thousands on the Nokia 6.1 Plus. It offers the right stuff: an above-average display, camera, performance, and battery life. It’s definitely worth the money., , The average 2018 smartphone of today in the Rs 10,000–15,000 range ostensibly possesses the following keywords in its description or advertisement: high screen-to-body ratio, high-gloss finish, 18:9 aspect ratio, notch, dual camera, fast charging, and AI-assisted camera. The Nokia 5.1 Plus also has all these keywords., Nokia 7.1 64GB Review, Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Apart from those, there are two other keywords that captured my attention: Android One, which means you’re assured of major software updates for two years on Android’s stock, bloatware-free version, and USB Type-C, which means the progressive new connector is finally making it to more affordable models. USB Type-C has hitherto been the preserve of more expensive smartphones, you see. Let’s explore these keywords in this review., The Nokia 5.1 Plus sports a neat, glossy look in my opinion. It comes covered in 2.5D curved glass on both the front and the back. The corners are curved smoothly. At about 8 millimetres of thickness, the phone is quite slim to look at. On the back, the rear camera area is raised and does not sit flush with the rear surface but that’s all right because you can barely notice or feel the projection. A circular, borderless fingerprint scanner sits beneath the camera setup., Lifting the Nokia 5.1 Plus is a bit of a slippery affair. Its glass back and smooth sides do little to offer sufficient grip and you’re often left pinching the sides of a resting phone to no avail. It’s the same story when holding the device in your hand. Changing hands and orientation is tricky as the phone threatens to slip unless held very tightly. I’d suggest getting a grippy case for this electronic slab of glass. It’s otherwise aesthetically pleasing enough to draw eyes towards it., , Let’s go around the sides of the phone. The top side contains a 3.5mm jack for headsets (bless Nokia) and a microphone hole. The left side is bare but for the SIM card tray. The right side bears a volume rocker and a power button beneath it. The bottom side has a speaker grille, a microphone hole, and—wait for it—a USB Type-C port. I was truly surprised to see a phone of this price sport USB-C. While it means investing in a new cable for some, it means another step taken in the direction of standardisation for the industry., , The buttons on the Nokia 5.1 Plus’ right side are easy to press and offer sufficient feedback. The rounded corners on the phone’s body ensure it’s always easy to hold and shift between fingers. The glassy front and back attract fingerprints and smudges like a powerful magnet and the phone demands constant Colin wipes to look tip-top. All things considered, the Nokia 5.1 Plus scores top marks in the build and design department, especially given its kind-hearted price tag., , Much of the Nokia 5.1 Plus’ front face is eaten up by the 5.8-inch display that has an aspect ratio of 19:9 and a resolution of 720 x 1520 pixels. The display has rounded corners that match those of the phone’s body, giving the face of the phone a more pleasing look. A thick notch measuring over 50 percent of the display’s width sits on top of the display to house the front camera, ambient light and proximity sensors, and the earpiece. The notch seems particularly thick and wide when compared with that on the Nokia 6.1 Plus. It also leaves very little space for icons on the left and right. Personally, I detest the notch as it comes in the way of essential information and makes the phone look odd. I detest it all the more on this particular device because the software has no option to blacken the sides of the notch., The HD+ display is capable of showing colours quite accurately; colours appear neither too light nor too saturated. At around 133 nits, screen brightness is sufficient for most indoor and outdoor spots. However, the surface of the screen can get very reflective in some angles. Touch sensitivity is good and almost every touch is registered at the first go. If anything, I think the resolution of display is a tad low. Even then, it doesn’t really show while watching 720p videos on YouTube. The + in the HD+ resolution takes care of that, I reckon., , Audio through the one-sided speaker is clear but not very loud. It’s loud enough to play that new song you’re really stuck with in a quiet, medium-size bedroom, but underwhelming when you want to show it to your colleagues in a noisy office space. There’s also ample opportunity to block the speaker grille with your finger when you’re holding the phone in landscape mode.  The volume and clarity of sound offered by the earpiece during calls on a JIO network seemed to be plenty., Unlike its more expensive brother, the Nokia 6.1 Plus, which uses a Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 chipset, the Nokia 5.1 Plus employs a MediaTek Helio P60 chipset. There’s 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage for apps to play around with. Luckily, the Nokia supports expandable storage up to 400GB. Graphics is taken care of by a Mali-G72 MP3 GPU. On benchmark tests, the Nokia 5.1 Plus bagged scores very close to our ideal scores. For instance, it scored 1,18,884 on AnTuTu 7.0 and 17,292 on 3DMark’s Ice Storm Unlimited test. On paper, these numbers seem healthy enough, but how do they translate to everyday real-world performance?, , Honor 9N is dearer by a few more thousands and runs a dated Kirin 659 chipset, , I was able to switch between half a dozen applications without any trouble. Chrome handled over thirty-two tabs without any lag or stutter. It would, naturally, refresh the tabs that were visited less frequently. I was even able to switch between three games with minimal reloading. I’m happy to report that the phone showed no stutters in animation while switching between apps or playing games like Air Force: Joint Combat. However, processing itself wasn’t all that quick. For example, when opened, the items in the Settings screen would take time to populate the screen. While trying to search for items quickly, the keyboard would pop up a second later than expected. Apart from these tiny niggles, the Nokia 5.1 Plus performed pretty well for its price. The fingerprint scanner took less than half a second to authenticate and unlock the phone, which is good. Finding it on the back side was a little hard though, given there’s no tactile border around the scanner., , Space around notches is wasted, I sorely wish Nokia hadn’t implemented a notch design in the display, like every other phone maker out there because I could tell the rework to make the status bar look and function right was shabby. The display area on either side of the notch is wasted when the phone is used in landscape mode. This is particularly noticeable while watching YouTube videos and playing games. What’s more, I saw occasional glitches in the UI—instances where the navigation bar and status bar didn’t align properly in landscape mode. Also, the search function in Settings showed the option to display battery percentage in the status bar when in reality it was removed completely for the notch modification. In short, Nokia could’ve either done a better job of cleaning up or not given into the whole notch trend altogether. Personally, I’d have preferred the latter because I’m just not a fan of this abhorrent design modification on phones., The stock Android UI was otherwise a pleasure to use. It came of free of bloatware that many other phone makers decide to include in the phone. The Nokia 5.1 Plus updated to the latet available build of Android 8.1 Oreo when it got access to the internet., , Navigation and status bar alignment glitches occur in landscape mode, The Nokia 5.1 Plus sports a dual camera setup on the back: a 13-megapixel sensor with an aperture of f/2.0, combined with a 5-megapixel depth sensor. Below it sits a single LED flash. On the front, it’s got an 8-megapixel shooter with an aperture of f/2.2. The real-world output from all these numbers is actually quite agreeable. Photos taken indoors and in daylight with the Nokia’s primary camera have accurate colours and ample brightness, although they tend to get grainy easily. Photos from the Nokia’s front camera too are colourful but miss the subject during auto-focus easily. They’re wide enough for taking photos with friends and family but show no depth of field. In low light, the rear camera manages to capture photos without too many grains but the same cannot be said of the front camera, which takes photos that are quite grainy. Luckily they’re  not too pixelated., , , , Subjects in selfies still a little out of focus, , Is it a ghost? Low-light photography not recommended., , Nope, it's a Funko Sotrmtrooper. Shot with flash turned on., , More grains than a bag of rice, The default camera app is easy enough to use but is slow to react. The phone hesitates for almost up to a second to work the shutter when the soft shutter button is pressed for the first time but speeds up with subsequent presses. This lazy reaction time doesn’t work in the phone’s favour because it’s the first shot that usually matters for most users., The default camera app has a Live Bokeh mode, with which you can take Bokeh-style shots while seeing the output realtime. What you see in the viewfinder screen and in the captured photo still differ though. The app gives you an option to adjust the level of Bokeh effect either before taking the shot or after taking it. The shutter button response gets slower still in this Live Bokeh mode., , Live Bokeh mode with the adjustable effect slider turned down to minimum, , Live Bokeh mode with the adjustable effect slider turned up halfway, , Live Bokeh mode with the adjustable effect slider turned up to maximum, Additionally, the camera app has a Manual mode for those who wish to play around with focal length, metering modes, white balance, and exposure compensation. The option to switch between the front and back cameras is tucked away along with the rest of the photo options on the top. I wish the button were larger and more conspicuously placed so taking selfies with the app would be a quicker affair. All things considered, the camera setup on the Nokia 5.1 Plus is not bad at all. It’s good enough for everyday photos even if it’s not particularly great for photography enthusiasts., The integrated 3,060mAh battery on the Nokia 5.1 Plus is a fighter. It goes a whole day with enough to spare on a single charge with mixed usage that involves a little bit of calling, some browsing, and some gaming and video playback (at least half an hour of it). In the GPS navigation test, the Nokia 5.1 Plus’ battery dropped from 57 to 40 percent after running Google Maps in 100-percent screen brightness for 40 minutes straight. On our standard benchmark test, the Nokia 5.1 Plus lasted 7 hours, 52 minutes., , Settings search says 'Battery Percentage in Status Bar' is available when it doesn't actually exist, Charging, or ‘fast charging’ as Nokia likes to call it, happened from 10 to 100 percent with the screen mostly in 1 hour, 57 minutes. The front and back sides of the phone do not get hot while charging or playing games on battery, which is a big relief for me and you. The USB Type-C compatibility makes plugging in easy because the connector is reversible., The Nokia 5.1 Plus is the first smartphone in its price range to feature a USB Type-C port, which already makes it a little progressive in design. Additionally, it offers an upmarket glassy body that’s sure enough to grab eyes or at the least look clean and classy in its users’ hands. It has an above-average display, camera, and battery, which gives potential customers enough reason to consider the Nokia seriously., , In addition to all these acceptable qualities, the Nokia 5.1 Plus warms the user’s insides by subscribing to Google’s Android One programme. This means the user is assured of two years of major software updates on Android’s bloatware-free version. Everything considered, I believe the Nokia 5.1 Plus is well worth its price tag of Rs 10,999."
2337,,oppo-f3-review-58377,0,0,2019-05-22,58377,Hardik Singh,OPPO F3 Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/oppo-f3-review-58377.html,"The Oppo F3 is an average smartphone, except in terms of selfies, where it excels. It’s not the best phone overall, with the Moto G5 Plus, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and some others being better overall performers., , Oppo is increasing investments in India compared to what it was doing two or three years back. The company laid out big expansion plans back in 2016, and was reportedly investing $216 million in manufacturing facilities in India. Oppo wanted to eventually produce 100 million units in the country. In addition, the company has put its foot on the gas, advertising its new selfie centric phones on all kinds of platforms. Oppo even sponsors the Indian cricket team, starting next month. , Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, All this is done on the back of a few phones, of which, the Oppo F3 and F3 Plus seem to be the forerunners. There are other phones in the company’s arsenal as well, but at the moment the company’s focus seems to be on selfies. Not just Oppo, other Chinese OEMs such as Gionee and Vivo are also ringing the same selfie bell at the moment, with large and wide advertising campaigns. Now, whether you want a selfie centric phone is up to you, but in our books, a phone should be more than just selfies, and while the Oppo F3 Plus did impress us, we are yet to see whether the smaller Oppo F3 can retain the same charm., , Selfies: Dual-camera, doubly good?
The Oppo F3 Plus was the best selfie centric smartphone we tested this year and the Oppo F3 tries to imitate it. There is a similar 16MP + 8MP dual camera setup at the front for solo and group selfies respectively. Like the F3 Plus, the 16MP camera here has 76.4 degree FOV and the 8MP camera has 120 degree FOV. Even the f/2.0 aperture is kept the same. That said, there are differences in the camera quality. The F3 tends to shoot slightly oversaturated colours, whereas the colour captured by the F3 Plus are nearer to being neutral. However, quality of overall images, including details, dynamic range and depth of field, remains almost at par, with the F3 Plus edging ahead in some pictures.,  , On its own, the Oppo F3 has good details, colours are pleasantly oversaturated, and noise is kept to acceptable levels. Photos are slightly soft, to remove skin blemishes and make selfies look better, but whether you like that will be a subjective opinion., , Compared to the Gionee A1, which has been the best phone for selfie aficionados available under 20K, the F3 is better. The Oppo F3 not only captures better details and colours in normal lighting conditions, but does a better job overall in low light as well. Photography enthusiasts may still find images lacking proper details and softer focus is somewhat annoying. But, at the end of the day, the Oppo F3 is now best selfie smartphone in the sub-20K range. There are some niggles, like the camera occasionally takes a little time in post processing when you are taking bokeh images or when switching between various filters, but these things are not really deal breakers., Primary camera: Good, not great
At the back, the Oppo F3 uses a tried and tested 13MP sensor, which takes good pictures for the most part. I observed decent colour reproduction and dynamic range, but softer photos, that seem to be produced by the same algorithm as the selfies. In the case of the rear camera, it’s more of an issue though., , This also means that while images look fine on the phone or even on a laptop display, one can easily see noise at native resolution (4160 x 3120). The noise levels rise further in low light, but images are good enough to share on Facebook. Yes, there are phones with better rear cameras at the same price, but this is amongst the better ones too. , , Images taken by the Oppo F3, Build and Design: Smaller, yet the same
Oppo has always followed a pretty decent design language and build quality, and that doesn't change with the Oppo F3. However, compared to the F3 Plus, the build quality does feel a bit inferior. The F3 Plus was built with more finesse and polish., , That being said, in the sub-20K smartphone bracket, there are only a few phones that are better built better, with the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, Gionee A1 and Nubia M2 Lite being perfect examples. The Oppo F3 is slimmer and lighter than the older Oppo F1s, putting it at par with most selfie phones it competes with. Now, one may complain that the phone looks like the old F1s or like any other phone in the market, and they won’t be wrong. Unfortunately, Oppo seems to be unwilling to innovate on its design. The Oppo F3 is good looking, but not new., Display: Nice!
The Oppo F3’s display is truly nice, and that’s about as vague as you can get about it. The fact is there’s nothing really special to be written about this display, but it’s not something to be trifled with either. In practical terms it has has vibrant colours, good touch response and very good viewing angles. If you want to go into numbers, it is a 1080p in-cell IPS panel, and it’s one of the best in the business. , , That being said, it could have been better too. The colours are not as vibrant as the Gionee A1’s AMOLED display, although it has higher resolution and at 765 Lux, feels brighter. I would also like to point out that the auto-brightness is well calibrated and there is a blue light filter as well for people who read or browse at night. , UI: iOS inspired
Nothing has changed from the last time we saw this UI. It is the same ColorOS 3.0 as the one we saw on the Oppo F3 Plus. Layered on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which is the first misstep anyway. After all, why is a phone in 2017 still using a two-year-old OS? Yes, the industry at large is doing it, but that’s only a sign of OEMs taking advantage of lack of consumer awareness.,   , Other than that, ColourOS looks and tries to function like iOS. It’s easy to understand and quite colourful. For the convenience of familiarity, the icons designs and the settings layout is very similar to iOS. However, the quick toggle menu is still a drop down from the top. Oppo has also included gestures and things like app cloning so that one can easily make use of dual SIMs to use dual Whatsapp accounts for example. There is a theme manager, a RAM booster app, lock-screen magazine feature, cloud backup and a secondary app store. The UI also offers a set of simple yet good looking apps for music, videos, clock, photos, weather, file manager and even email., Performance: Lacking the punch
Under the hood, the phone is powered by a MediaTek MT6750T SoC, which is paired with 4GB of RAM. Now, this SoC has been around for more than two years and has been used by more than a dozen smartphones, some of which are as inexpensive as Rs. 8,000. The point is, it is not a very performance oriented SoC and that shows here. While the phone can handle almost all kinds of apps, one notices occasional stutters and sluggishness. This became quite apparent when I tried gaming on the phone. Games like Asphalt 8 ran at below 30 fps, while those that weren’t capped to 30fps, were usually getting as far as 40-45fps. It’s not particularly unplayable, but the experience is sub-par to say the least. You see lags and frame drops often. , , , , There were also occasional app crashes and the camera app sometimes takes a little more time to take a selfie, which is supposed to be the prime feature of this phone., On the other hand, call quality is decent and audio volume via the single speaker at the bottom is adequate. But, like every other smartphone in the same price bracket, audio quality is nothing worth writing home about. Via headphones, the phone really shines and offers good overall output., Battery: Just enough
The 3200mAh battery on the phone can keep up with even the heaviest users and would last a normal work day easily, with at max 30 minutes of gaming. If you are not into gaming or don’t use navigation that often, the phone will definitely last you more than 12-15 hours in a day. Once you put it on charge, the phone gets fully charged under two hours and does not support any kind of fast charging, including Oppo’s own VOOC charging technology. It seems VOOC is another feature the company is reserving for its flagship devices., Bottomline: For selfies only
To sum it all, the Oppo F3 takes the best selfies of any phone under Rs. 20,000. However, it’s not a very good overall performer. Consider it for selfies, but the Moto G5 Plus, Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 and the Coolpad Cool 1 are better overall performers. "
2342,,oppo-f9-pro-review-134946,0,0,2019-05-09,134946,Subhrojit Mallick,Oppo F9 Pro Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/oppo-f9-pro-review-134946.html,"The Oppo F9  Pro certainly looks stunning. The design including the gradient glass back and the water drop notch does make the phone stand out. The new UI also helps make the phone look more premium. But it’s performance leaves a lot to be desired, especially considering the price it’s offered at and the competition. The Snapdragon 845-powered Poco F1 is available at a lower price point while the Nokia 7 Plus is an all-rounder in terms of performance and imaging. The primary (if not the only one) reason to get the Oppo F9 Pro is for its selfie camera that relies on extensive AI algorithms to deliver results that are both eye-pleasing and well-detailed. The VOOC charging tech is also nullified somewhat by a poor battery life. Get this only if you are a selfie enthusiast and consider your smartphone to be a fashion statement., , In 2018, there’s a thin line between a fashion statement and a smartphone for daily use. With how the designs are evolving, the line is only going to get murkier. Take the Oppo F9 Pro for instance. The company calls it a work of art. And for the most part, it is. Oppo clearly has spent a lot of time refining the design of the phone. You get a whole new notch on top of the display and gradient colour patterns. It clearly looks different and in the price range it launched at, the Oppo F9 Pro does have a lot of competition. It’s new from the inside as well with an updated version of ColorOS based on Android 8.1 Oreo and super-fast VOOC charging. It also happens to be the first phone in Oppo’s F-series to feature a dual rear camera. That’s a lot of new things for the Chinese upstart, but how do they add up in the larger scheme of things? Let’s find out., Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, , The Oppo F9 Pro does look like a work of art. The phone is offered in Sunrise Red, Twilight Blue and Starry Purple. Each variant has a gradient of colours based on red, blue and purple, respectively. We received the Twilight Blue variant for the review but my eyes were on the Starry Purple. The first two variants take the diamond-shaped pattern from the Oppo F7 and refine it further, making it look ever so subtle. The colour also changes from royal blue to a darker shade as you go upwards. Even the metal rim holding the glass-sandwich design has the same gradient colours. The dual camera unit has silver accents around it. The design is possible because of a glass-back and since Oppo didn’t advertise about a protective layer, it’s safer to put a case on it. Up front, there’s a new notch. Well, a new shape that is. Depending on what you think about the notch, it could be annoying as hell or you’ll be indifferent to it. The notch on the Oppo F9 Pro is shaped like a water-drop. The top of the screen dips slightly from the middle. It’s no longer a long black bar on top, and that provides the screen more real-estate. As a result, the Oppo F9 Pro’s screen takes up 90.8 percent of the body. There are minimal bezels all around, making the screen really immersive. The keys on the edges are slightly wobbly and feels plasticky. Also, despite having a slim 8mm body, the F9 Pro finds space for a 3.5mm headphone jack. The Oppo F9 Pro’s design is most definitely one of the reasons to buy the phone, but can’t be the only reason to buy it., , The Oppo F9 Pro’s new water-drop notch makes the 6.3-inch panel look a lot more immersive. It uses an LTPS IPS LCD display and there’s no noticeable difference from the usual IPS LCD panels. The screen has an aspect ratio of 19.5:9 and FullHD+ resolution. The colours come out nice and vibrant with a cool blueish tint on top. It’s quite bright too and is perfectly visible outdoors under direct sunlight. There is a distinct black border at the bottom that sort of eats away from the real estate. Furthermore, because of the new notch, it may seem like you’ll get a bigger display, but in reality, the content will be cropped in the shape of the notch from the side. So, if you’re watching a video, it won’t be seamless and will have a waterdrop-shaped interruption in the middle. And if you’re playing games like PubG Mobile, high chances the controls will be cropped partly too. In my opinion, the new notch doesn’t really solve the problem notches inherently have. It does add to the design of the phone, I’ll give you that., , , While the design and the display are certainly new, the chipset powering the Oppo F9 Pro is MediaTek’s top-of-the-line Helio P20 SoC. The chipset has been used in devices in the budget segment as well in high-end phones, and has been there for sometime. It’s a 64-bit octa-core chipset based on TSMC’s 16nm process and can clock all the way up to 2.3GHz. There’s a Mali-T880 GPU and a dedicated co-processor for handling machine-learning tasks. It’s performance is at par with what you would get from last year’s Qualcomm mid-ranger chipsets like the Snapdragon 625, and doesn’t really compare well with the Snapdragon 660-powered phones like the Nokia 7 Plus and even the Poco F1. The benchmark results show just that., On AnTuTu, the F9 Pro scored 137153 while on Geekbench Single and Multi Core tests, the F9 Pro scored 1485 and 5716 respectively. That puts the F9 Pro at par with other mid-rangers like the Xiaomi Redmi 5 and the Xiaomi Mi A2 beat the phone hands down. In terms of graphical prowess, the F9 Pro scored 1697 in 3D Mark’s Slingshot test., In real-life, the F9 Pro is capable enough in handling day-to-day tasks like browsing, taking photos and checking social media. There’s 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage with a dedicated slot for expandable memory. Even after intensive use, you still have around 1.5GB of RAM available all the time. That allows the phone some breathing space when you are using it intensively. Games like PubG Mobile and Asphalt 9 run without much of a hitch, although the popular battle royale game runs on medium graphics settings to begin with. Gaming also drains the battery much faster and I could play only two sessions of PubG Mobile with 40 percent charge., The F9 Pro also ushers in a new version of Oppo’s UI called ColorOS 5.2. It’s a lot more refined and looks more mature. Gone are the cartoonish icons, but the app drawer is still missing. There’s new gesture-based navigation and some interesting security features like a fraud-filter (that lets you block phone numbers), fake base station blocking (to prevent fraudulent messages), and caller ID. Furthermore, you can have floating windows, dual apps, private space and more. Overall, the UI is quite feature-rich and now looks a lot more polished., , The Oppo F9 Pro touts a dual camera unit at the back and a single 25MP front camera. On the back, there’s a primary 16MP sensor and a 2MP secondary sensor for depth-sensing. Quite expectedly, it uses the chipset’s NPU to deliver AI-based enhancements to the photos. Oppo claims the phone can detect 16 scenes and apply the relevant settings. Up front, there’s sensor-based HDR and AI Beautification 2.0. The focus, as with most Oppo devices is on taking good selfies. And in that regard, the F9 Pro can make you look a lot better than you usually look. It uses AI algorithms to control the backlight, enhance the facial features and what not. The rear camera also has iPhone X-like portrait lighting effects, but they hardly work as advertised., , In daylight, the photos come out fairly sharp and vibrant. The HDR works to increase details in the shadows and the resulting images are at par with most high-end photos when the light is optimal. It also focuses quite fast thanks to PDAF., , Indoors, the camera does take a little time to focus, but there’s no shutter lag meaning you can quickly take a snap. The details are also quite well-preserved with little to no noise. It’s difficult to know whether the AI is working because there’s no way to turn the feature off., , , As for low-light, the camera can reproduce the scene quite well using aggressive noise-reduction algorithms. There’s heavy softening in the dark, shadowy regions because of this, but the overall photo gives a pleasing effect. It’s not the best low-light camera in that price range, but you can work with it., , Vivid Selfie Mode, , Portrait Selfie , Selfies are the biggest part of the package. The F9 Pro can take well-detailed selfies in which you do look much better than you actually are. The HDR function works to recover details from harsh light, but more importantly, the software algorithms make your face the center of attention. The algorithms can also detect your arms and neck to apply the effects consistently in the photo. If you like to take a lot of selfies, the F9 Pro is the device to go for at the moment in that price range., The Oppo F9 Pro brings back the company’s proprietary VOOC charging technology to the F-series. It was seen in the first F-series phone a couple of years back and then it just disappeared. It’s supremely useful and offers and experience similar to what OnePlus users get. It relies on low-voltage fast charging to top up the 3,500mAh battery in a little over an hour. Furthermore, Oppo offers a five-layer protection right from the charging unit to the cable to the phone itself. This includes a voltage tester in the adapter and the phone, fuse and VOOC identification firmware to prevent excess current draw., During my usage, the VOOC charge really helped. I could plug in the phone for 15 minutes and get around two hours of controlled usage, gaming excluded. In our PC Mark Work 2.0 Battery test, the Oppo F9 Pro lasted 4 hours 25 minutes. That’s comparatively much less than what phones like the Nokia 7 Plus and even the Poco F1 offers. If not for the fast charging tech, the F9 Pro’s battery life would be dismal., In real-life usage as well, the phone lasted the typical work day (10AM to 7PM) with moderate to heavy use. If you’re looking for a phone with a long battery life, this isn’t the best option to go for., The Oppo F9  Pro certainly looks stunning. The design including the gradient glass back and the water drop notch does make the phone stand out. The new UI also helps make the phone look more premium. But it’s performance leaves a lot to be desired, especially considering the price it’s offered at and the competition. The Snapdragon 845-powered Poco F1 is available at a lower price point while the Nokia 7 Plus is an all-rounder in terms of performance and imaging. The primary (if not the only one) reason to get the Oppo F9 Pro is for its selfie camera that relies on extensive AI algorithms to deliver results that are both eye-pleasing and well-detailed. The VOOC charging tech is also nullified somewhat by a poor battery life. Get this only if you are a selfie enthusiast and consider your smartphone to be a fashion statement."
2426,,oppo-realme-u1-review-173427,0,0,2019-05-22,173427,Swapnil Mathur,Realme U1 Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/oppo-realme-u1-review-173427.html,"The Realme U1 is a real mixed bag of a smartphone. While the MediaTek Helio P70 chipset that powers it allows the phone to breeeze through most daily tasks, it does falter when it comes to heavy gaming. The camera performance is impressive, but does not offer any customisation options. The battery life is good enough to get you through the day. The Realme U1 is a decent phone, but the 4GB variant will struggle eventually., , Ever since Realme broke up with Oppo, the company has been on a launch spree, releasing devices across the entry level and mid-range price segments. Their main USP so far has been the use of a unique design language for a phone that offered fairly standard feature set. Now, we have the Realme U1, the company’s budget device with a design similar to what we’ve seen on Honor phones, but this is the first smartphone with a Helio P70 processor. Priced at Rs 11,999, does the Realme U1 offer enough of a performance and style quotient to take on the heavy weights of the mid-range segment? Let’s find out., Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, The Realme U1 could just as easily be an Honor phone. No joke. The company has not used the diamond cut finish and instead, has gone for a plain look on the back. The uniqueness is in the colour treatment. We received the “Fiery Gold” variant and the back reflects light in a way that it appears to be a multi-coloured surface. Honestly, it doesn’t matter if Honor did it first, Realme U1 does it well too. The gold variant is personally not a favourite, but there are people out there who will like the gold-pink tones with a silver lining around the fingerprint sensor and the camera module., 
The Realme U1 has a glass-sandwich design, The frame of the U1 is painted a slightly darker shade of gold in comparison to the back. The frame itself isn’t made of metal, and instead feels more like a polycarbonate shell. The display on the front doesn’t sit flush with the frame and instead, sticks out just a little. This makes us wary of its durability, because in the event of a drop, the edge of the display is likely to make contact with the hard surface. Thankfully, there is a screen protector pre-applied on the display but cannot stress on the importance of using this phone in the provided case. , , Overall, the build quality of the Realme U1 looks premium, but feels just a smidge above average. It’s a light smartphone that uses glass and polycarbonate to keep the weight down, which takes a few points away from the construction quality., The Realme U1 sports a 6.3-inch IPS display with a resolution of 2340x1080, pegging its pixel density at roughly 409ppi. The display features a teardrop notch that houses the 25-megapixel front facing camera and honestly, does not so much get in the way of things. At first sight, the display looks like a solid panel, until we actually started testing it., Our lux meter pegged the maximum brightness of the panel at a paltry 120 lux, far below what we expected. Realme 2Pro had also clocked a peak brightness of 512 lux in our review, but the 115-lux value was sorely disappointing. Additionally, the illumination of the panel is uneven, with the top of the display clocking 112 lux of brightness and the bottom clocking 120 lux. It is possible that this is an isolated issue with the review unit we received, but the very low maximum brightness is definitely a concern., 
The Realme U1's FHD+ display has poor maximum brightness, The low peak brightness also causes a problem when it comes to using the phone under bright daylight. While text is easy to read for the most part, watching content is a little hard especially when videos have dark scenes. The screen protector also adds to the reflectiveness, causing obstructions on the display. This is all outdoors. Indoors, however, things are pleasantly good. Using this phone indoors in the office feels adequately good for any and all needs. For the course of this review, we had the phone’s brightness set on auto and did not face issues with it, except for the occasional instance when using the phone outdoors in bright light. The third situation for our testing involved using the phone in bed, in pitch dark. The phone’s display can dim down all the way to 2 lux, meaning you can easily use it in bed and we found it to be a good device for bed-time reading., Lastly, despite a fullHD display, the Realme U1 can only stream FullHD content from YouTube and other open services due to a Widevine L3 certification. This means that you will not be able to stream FullHD content from Netflix or Amazon Prime Videos. , The display on the Realme U1 is a somewhat underwhelming experience. It is okay that it can’t stream FullHD content from Netflix and Prime Videos, but the 120 lux peak brightness is definitely an issue that limits its usability outdoors. Thankfully, this is a feature that can be fixed to a degree by means of software updates, but it remains to be seen whether Realme would actually do that., The Realme U1 sports the MediaTek Helio P70 manufactured on the 12nm fabrication process. The FinFET design allows the chip to consume 15 percent less power than the 14nm counterparts. The Helio P70 comprises of 4 Cortex A73 cores clocked at 2100MHz and 4 Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1989MHz. Our review unit came with 4GB RAM and 64GB of on-board storage. According to AIDA64, the Realme U1 is running on an Oppo branded logic board., We first ran our standard suite of benchmark tests to see just how well the P70 chipset with 4GB RAM can perform. Interestingly, the numbers were somewhat impressive. We also ran a CPU/GPU profiler to monitor CPU clock speeds in relation to the load each core was under so as to determine if there was unwarranted boosting of the CPU core clocks. We found that during an AnTuTu run, the Cortex A53 clocks did ramp up to their 1.9GHz speeds, but the Cortex A73 cores only modestly clocked their top speed. This is a promising change from what we’ve seen previously on Realme phones, where the CPU was always at its peak clockspeed while benchmarks would run. This time around, this behavior did not present itself during our benchmark runs. What we did notice was the Helio P70 powered Realme U1 score higher than even the Redmi Note 6 Pro in some benchmarks. On AnTuTu, the Realme U1 scored 143431 while the Redmi Note 6 Pro scored 116046. Even on Geekbench single and multi-core tests, the Realme U1 scored 1560 and 5994 against 1332 and 4861 scored by Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro respectively. , , , In real life, this performance is reflected in the smooth operating of the UI elements of ColorOS. The phone is very smooth to use and switching between apps is also a stutter free process. Where we did see a small performance drop while trying to scroll through a page in Chrome. In the phone’s defence, there were 19 tabs loaded in Chrome already and we were trying to browse the fifth, a text heavy website. Scrolling up and down showed a very slight delay, but it wasn’t consistent. Gaming was another avenue where the phone barely managed to scrape through. While playing Asphalt 9, the load times were rather long for the menu screen and the races themselves. Once the level loaded, the gameplay was mostly smooth, with frame drops being noticeable only once in a while. With PubG, the game did show some. Stutter was evident especially when using a scope and the game in general ran at medium graphic settings. You could get away with a decent round in Pochinki if you close all background processes, which is the best you can get on an Android phone with 4GB RAM. Casual gaming on the other hand would be absolutely fine, as we have experienced from hours of playing Bouncing Hoops, Subway Surfer etc., When it comes to performance, the ground reality is that for most uses, the Realme U1 manages to maintain a smooth user experience. For example, as a student, you will be able to browse and research your topics of study with ease. You will also be able to relax with a casual gaming session, and edit photos using Snapseed. However, if you’re going to rely on this phone for heavy gaming like playing PubG, you may want to invest a little more for the 6GB variant., The Realme U1 sports a dual camera assembly on the back which includes a 12-megapixel camera shooting through a lens with an f/2.2 aperture and a secondary 2 megapixel depth camera. The aperture on the depth camera is f/2.4. While testing the camera of the Realme U1, the first thing that stands out is the good shutter response. There is little to no lag here, which is good. However, there are times when the camera is still looking for the right object to focus on, causing a just barely noticeable delay in taking the shot., The daylight performance of the camera was surprisingly good. The detail retention was surprisingly good, although not quiet at a level where we would be blown away. What is evident is though is that the horrible JPG compression isn’t prevalent., , , Shooting photos indoors in semi-low light are also surprisingly decent for a phone in this price segment. While there is noticeable loss in detail in indoor shots, the photos do present themselves without any noise. The dynamic range in all photos also presents at an adequate level. The portrait also does a decent job of subject separation and the amount of background separation, although, the amount of background blur cannot be adjusted.,  The highlight of the Realme U1 is the selfie camera, which is a 25-megapixel Sony IMX 576 unit. Realme is betting on the U1 to be a selfie-centric smartphone and as such, does offer the usual slew of features such as a user-definable beauty mode. The optics are also designed rather well, being resistant to significant flaring when shooting against bright light. Skin detail is obviously lost with or without beautification filters. , , What was interesting to note in the camera app was the lack of access to settings. There is no way to select what aspect ratio you want to shoot photos in and neither is there any ability to change video resolution or frame rates. Even the slow-motion setting is fixed and you won’t really know what fps or resolution its shooting at. This, in our opinion, is a massive omission. Even if there are no settings to change, it would have been nice to know the resolutions and aspect ratios the photos and videos are being shot at. The only tweakable setting is the ability to turn Beauty AI on/off and the ability to apply a filter effect to photos. , You can see more image samples in our FLICKR gallery here., Overall, while quality of the photos produced by the front and rear camera are decent, a lack of settings means there is no flexibility in the output. Most smartphones in this price bracket offer a more loaded and flexible camera app, with varying degrees of output quality., The Realme U1 is powered by a 3500mAh battery which does not support fast charging. On regular use, the phone gives a little over a day’s use, but does not hit the day and a half mark. For our peace of mind, we eventually had to charge the phone every night. The phone would be pulled off the charger at 8am and by midnight, the battery would drop to 25-30 percent. By the next morning, there would still be enough charge to make it to work, but since the first half of the day involves plenty of calls and emails, having a larger reserve of battery is of utmost importance. If you’re okay with charging the phone every night, there is seldom a situation where you’ll find yourself running out of juice., The Realme U1 powered by the MediaTek Helio P70 chipset finally delivers a good degree of performance without artificially boosting numbers. The camera is decent for the price, but the display is a big let-down. While we won’t criticize the phone for not having L1 certification, we did not expect that a display on a smartphone could have such a low level of brightness. This is a major issue that needs fixing on Realme’s part as it hampers outdoor usability of the phone. Other than that, it is a fairly good phone by itself but those looking for smooth gaming experiences especially in PubG, you’d be better off with the 6GB variant of the phone or another device which is more power packed altogether. "

Thankfully, there is a screen protector pre-applied on the display but cannot stress on the importance of using this phone in the provided case. , , Overall, the build quality of the Realme U1 looks premium, but feels just a smidge above average. It’s a light smartphone that uses glass and polycarbonate to keep the weight down, which takes a few points away from the construction quality., The Realme U1 sports a 6.3-inch IPS display with a resolution of 2340x1080, pegging its pixel density at roughly 409ppi. The display features a teardrop notch that houses the 25-megapixel front facing camera and honestly, does not so much get in the way of things. At first sight, the display looks like a solid panel, until we actually started testing it., Our lux meter pegged the maximum brightness of the panel at a paltry 120 lux, far below what we expected. Realme 2Pro had also clocked a peak brightness of 512 lux in our review, but the 115-lux value was sorely disappointing. Additionally, the illumination of the panel is uneven, with the top of the display clocking 112 lux of brightness and the bottom clocking 120 lux. It is possible that this is an isolated issue with the review unit we received, but the very low maximum brightness is definitely a concern., 
The Realme U1's FHD+ display has poor maximum brightness, The low peak brightness also causes a problem when it comes to using the phone under bright daylight. While text is easy to read for the most part, watching content is a little hard especially when videos have dark scenes. The screen protector also adds to the reflectiveness, causing obstructions on the display. This is all outdoors. Indoors, however, things are pleasantly good. Using this phone indoors in the office feels adequately good for any and all needs. For the course of this review, we had the phone’s brightness set on auto and did not face issues with it, except for the occasional instance when using the phone outdoors in bright light. The third situation for our testing involved using the phone in bed, in pitch dark. The phone’s display can dim down all the way to 2 lux, meaning you can easily use it in bed and we found it to be a good device for bed-time reading., Lastly, despite a fullHD display, the Realme U1 can only stream FullHD content from YouTube and other open services due to a Widevine L3 certification. This means that you will not be able to stream FullHD content from Netflix or Amazon Prime Videos. , The display on the Realme U1 is a somewhat underwhelming experience. It is okay that it can’t stream FullHD content from Netflix and Prime Videos, but the 120 lux peak brightness is definitely an issue that limits its usability outdoors. Thankfully, this is a feature that can be fixed to a degree by means of software updates, but it remains to be seen whether Realme would actually do that., The Realme U1 sports the MediaTek Helio P70 manufactured on the 12nm fabrication process. The FinFET design allows the chip to consume 15 percent less power than the 14nm counterparts. The Helio P70 comprises of 4 Cortex A73 cores clocked at 2100MHz and 4 Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1989MHz. Our review unit came with 4GB RAM and 64GB of on-board storage. According to AIDA64, the Realme U1 is running on an Oppo branded logic board., We first ran our standard suite of benchmark tests to see just how well the P70 chipset with 4GB RAM can perform. Interestingly, the numbers were somewhat impressive. We also ran a CPU/GPU profiler to monitor CPU clock speeds in relation to the load each core was under so as to determine if there was unwarranted boosting of the CPU core clocks. We found that during an AnTuTu run, the Cortex A53 clocks did ramp up to their 1.9GHz speeds, but the Cortex A73 cores only modestly clocked their top speed. This is a promising change from what we’ve seen previously on Realme phones, where the CPU was always at its peak clockspeed while benchmarks would run. This time around, this behavior did not present itself during our benchmark runs. What we did notice was the Helio P70 powered Realme U1 score higher than even the Redmi Note 6 Pro in some benchmarks. On AnTuTu, the Realme U1 scored 143431 while the Redmi Note 6 Pro scored 116046. Even on Geekbench single and multi-core tests, the Realme U1 scored 1560 and 5994 against 1332 and 4861 scored by Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro respectively. , , , In real life, this performance is reflected in the smooth operating of the UI elements of ColorOS. The phone is very smooth to use and switching between apps is also a stutter free process. Where we did see a small performance drop while trying to scroll through a page in Chrome. In the phone’s defence, there were 19 tabs loaded in Chrome already and we were trying to browse the fifth, a text heavy website. Scrolling up and down showed a very slight delay, but it wasn’t consistent. Gaming was another avenue where the phone barely managed to scrape through. While playing Asphalt 9, the load times were rather long for the menu screen and the races themselves. Once the level loaded, the gameplay was mostly smooth, with frame drops being noticeable only once in a while. With PubG, the game did show some. Stutter was evident especially when using a scope and the game in general ran at medium graphic settings. You could get away with a decent round in Pochinki if you close all background processes, which is the best you can get on an Android phone with 4GB RAM. Casual gaming on the other hand would be absolutely fine, as we have experienced from hours of playing Bouncing Hoops, Subway Surfer etc., When it comes to performance, the ground reality is that for most uses, the Realme U1 manages to maintain a smooth user experience. For example, as a student, you will be able to browse and research your topics of study with ease. You will also be able to relax with a casual gaming session, and edit photos using Snapseed. However, if you’re going to rely on this phone for heavy gaming like playing PubG, you may want to invest a little more for the 6GB variant., The Realme U1 sports a dual camera assembly on the back which includes a 12-megapixel camera shooting through a lens with an f/2.2 aperture and a secondary 2 megapixel depth camera. The aperture on the depth camera is f/2.4. While testing the camera of the Realme U1, the first thing that stands out is the good shutter response. There is little to no lag here, which is good. However, there are times when the camera is still looking for the right object to focus on, causing a just barely noticeable delay in taking the shot., The daylight performance of the camera was surprisingly good. The detail retention was surprisingly good, although not quiet at a level where we would be blown away. What is evident is though is that the horrible JPG compression isn’t prevalent., , , Shooting photos indoors in semi-low light are also surprisingly decent for a phone in this price segment. While there is noticeable loss in detail in indoor shots, the photos do present themselves without any noise. The dynamic range in all photos also presents at an adequate level. The portrait also does a decent job of subject separation and the amount of background separation, although, the amount of background blur cannot be adjusted.,  The highlight of the Realme U1 is the selfie camera, which is a 25-megapixel Sony IMX 576 unit. Realme is betting on the U1 to be a selfie-centric smartphone and as such, does offer the usual slew of features such as a user-definable beauty mode. The optics are also designed rather well, being resistant to significant flaring when shooting against bright light. Skin detail is obviously lost with or without beautification filters. , , What was interesting to note in the camera app was the lack of access to settings. There is no way to select what aspect ratio you want to shoot photos in and neither is there any ability to change video resolution or frame rates. Even the slow-motion setting is fixed and you won’t really know what fps or resolution its shooting at. This, in our opinion, is a massive omission. Even if there are no settings to change, it would have been nice to know the resolutions and aspect ratios the photos and videos are being shot at. The only tweakable setting is the ability to turn Beauty AI on/off and the ability to apply a filter effect to photos. , You can see more image samples in our FLICKR gallery here., Overall, while quality of the photos produced by the front and rear camera are decent, a lack of settings means there is no flexibility in the output. Most smartphones in this price bracket offer a more loaded and flexible camera app, with varying degrees of output quality., The Realme U1 is powered by a 3500mAh battery which does not support fast charging. On regular use, the phone gives a little over a day’s use, but does not hit the day and a half mark. For our peace of mind, we eventually had to charge the phone every night. The phone would be pulled off the charger at 8am and by midnight, the battery would drop to 25-30 percent. By the next morning, there would still be enough charge to make it to work, but since the first half of the day involves plenty of calls and emails, having a larger reserve of battery is of utmost importance. If you’re okay with charging the phone every night, there is seldom a situation where you’ll find yourself running out of juice., The Realme U1 powered by the MediaTek Helio P70 chipset finally delivers a good degree of performance without artificially boosting numbers. The camera is decent for the price, but the display is a big let-down. While we won’t criticize the phone for not having L1 certification, we did not expect that a display on a smartphone could have such a low level of brightness. This is a major issue that needs fixing on Realme’s part as it hampers outdoor usability of the phone. Other than that, it is a fairly good phone by itself but those looking for smooth gaming experiences especially in PubG, you’d be better off with the 6GB variant of the phone or another device which is more power packed altogether. "

While the MediaTek Helio P70 chipset that powers it allows the phone to breeeze through most daily tasks, it does falter when it comes to heavy gaming. The camera performance is impressive, but does not offer any customisation options. The battery life is good enough to get you through the day. The Realme U1 is a decent phone, but the 4GB variant will struggle eventually., , Ever since Realme broke up with Oppo, the company has been on a launch spree, releasing devices across the entry level and mid-range price segments. Their main USP so far has been the use of a unique design language for a phone that offered fairly standard feature set. Now, we have the Realme U1, the company’s budget device with a design similar to what we’ve seen on Honor phones, but this is the first smartphone with a Helio P70 processor. Priced at Rs 11,999, does the Realme U1 offer enough of a performance and style quotient to take on the heavy weights of the mid-range segment? Let’s find out., Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, The Realme U1 could just as easily be an Honor phone. No joke. The company has not used the diamond cut finish and instead, has gone for a plain look on the back. The uniqueness is in the colour treatment. We received the “Fiery Gold” variant and the back reflects light in a way that it appears to be a multi-coloured surface. Honestly, it doesn’t matter if Honor did it first, Realme U1 does it well too. The gold variant is personally not a favourite, but there are people out there who will like the gold-pink tones with a silver lining around the fingerprint sensor and the camera module., 
The Realme U1 has a glass-sandwich design, The frame of the U1 is painted a slightly darker shade of gold in comparison to the back. The frame itself isn’t made of metal, and instead feels more like a polycarbonate shell. The display on the front doesn’t sit flush with the frame and instead, sticks out just a little. This makes us wary of its durability, because in the event of a drop, the edge of the display is likely to make contact with the hard surface.

While the MediaTek Helio P70 chipset that powers it allows the phone to breeeze through most daily tasks, it does falter when it comes to heavy gaming. The camera performance is impressive, but does not offer any customisation options. The battery life is good enough to get you through the day. The Realme U1 is a decent phone, but the 4GB variant will struggle eventually., , Ever since Realme broke up with Oppo, the company has been on a launch spree, releasing devices across the entry level and mid-range price segments. Their main USP so far has been the use of a unique design language for a phone that offered fairly standard feature set. Now, we have the Realme U1, the company’s budget device with a design similar to what we’ve seen on Honor phones, but this is the first smartphone with a Helio P70 processor. Priced at Rs 11,999, does the Realme U1 offer enough of a performance and style quotient to take on the heavy weights of the mid-range segment? Let’s find out., Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, The Realme U1 could just as easily be an Honor phone. No joke. The company has not used the diamond cut finish and instead, has gone for a plain look on the back. The uniqueness is in the colour treatment. We received the “Fiery Gold” variant and the back reflects light in a way that it appears to be a multi-coloured surface. Honestly, it doesn’t matter if Honor did it first, Realme U1 does it well too. The gold variant is personally not a favourite, but there are people out there who will like the gold-pink tones with a silver lining around the fingerprint sensor and the camera module., 
The Realme U1 has a glass-sandwich design, The frame of the U1 is painted a slightly darker shade of gold in comparison to the back. The frame itself isn’t made of metal, and instead feels more like a polycarbonate shell. The display on the front doesn’t sit flush with the frame and instead, sticks out just a little. This makes us wary of its durability, because in the event of a drop, the edge of the display is likely to make contact with the hard surface. Thankfully, there is a screen protector pre-applied on the display but cannot stress on the importance of using this phone in the provided case. , , Overall, the build quality of the Realme U1 looks premium, but feels just a smidge above average. It’s a light smartphone that uses glass and polycarbonate to keep the weight down, which takes a few points away from the construction quality., The Realme U1 sports a 6.3-inch IPS display with a resolution of 2340x1080, pegging its pixel density at roughly 409ppi. The display features a teardrop notch that houses the 25-megapixel front facing camera and honestly, does not so much get in the way of things. At first sight, the display looks like a solid panel, until we actually started testing it., Our lux meter pegged the maximum brightness of the panel at a paltry 120 lux, far below what we expected. Realme 2Pro had also clocked a peak brightness of 512 lux in our review, but the 115-lux value was sorely disappointing. Additionally, the illumination of the panel is uneven, with the top of the display clocking 112 lux of brightness and the bottom clocking 120 lux. It is possible that this is an isolated issue with the review unit we received, but the very low maximum brightness is definitely a concern., 
The Realme U1's FHD+ display has poor maximum brightness, The low peak brightness also causes a problem when it comes to using the phone under bright daylight. While text is easy to read for the most part, watching content is a little hard especially when videos have dark scenes. The screen protector also adds to the reflectiveness, causing obstructions on the display. This is all outdoors. Indoors, however, things are pleasantly good. Using this phone indoors in the office feels adequately good for any and all needs. For the course of this review, we had the phone’s brightness set on auto and did not face issues with it, except for the occasional instance when using the phone outdoors in bright light. The third situation for our testing involved using the phone in bed, in pitch dark. The phone’s display can dim down all the way to 2 lux, meaning you can easily use it in bed and we found it to be a good device for bed-time reading., Lastly, despite a fullHD display, the Realme U1 can only stream FullHD content from YouTube and other open services due to a Widevine L3 certification. This means that you will not be able to stream FullHD content from Netflix or Amazon Prime Videos. , The display on the Realme U1 is a somewhat underwhelming experience. It is okay that it can’t stream FullHD content from Netflix and Prime Videos, but the 120 lux peak brightness is definitely an issue that limits its usability outdoors. Thankfully, this is a feature that can be fixed to a degree by means of software updates, but it remains to be seen whether Realme would actually do that., The Realme U1 sports the MediaTek Helio P70 manufactured on the 12nm fabrication process. The FinFET design allows the chip to consume 15 percent less power than the 14nm counterparts. The Helio P70 comprises of 4 Cortex A73 cores clocked at 2100MHz and 4 Cortex A53 cores clocked at 1989MHz. Our review unit came with 4GB RAM and 64GB of on-board storage. According to AIDA64, the Realme U1 is running on an Oppo branded logic board., We first ran our standard suite of benchmark tests to see just how well the P70 chipset with 4GB RAM can perform. Interestingly, the numbers were somewhat impressive. We also ran a CPU/GPU profiler to monitor CPU clock speeds in relation to the load each core was under so as to determine if there was unwarranted boosting of the CPU core clocks. We found that during an AnTuTu run, the Cortex A53 clocks did ramp up to their 1.9GHz speeds, but the Cortex A73 cores only modestly clocked their top speed. This is a promising change from what we’ve seen previously on Realme phones, where the CPU was always at its peak clockspeed while benchmarks would run. This time around, this behavior did not present itself during our benchmark runs. What we did notice was the Helio P70 powered Realme U1 score higher than even the Redmi Note 6 Pro in some benchmarks. On AnTuTu, the Realme U1 scored 143431 while the Redmi Note 6 Pro scored 116046. Even on Geekbench single and multi-core tests, the Realme U1 scored 1560 and 5994 against 1332 and 4861 scored by Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro respectively. , , , In real life, this performance is reflected in the smooth operating of the UI elements of ColorOS. The phone is very smooth to use and switching between apps is also a stutter free process. Where we did see a small performance drop while trying to scroll through a page in Chrome. In the phone’s defence, there were 19 tabs loaded in Chrome already and we were trying to browse the fifth, a text heavy website. Scrolling up and down showed a very slight delay, but it wasn’t consistent. Gaming was another avenue where the phone barely managed to scrape through. While playing Asphalt 9, the load times were rather long for the menu screen and the races themselves. Once the level loaded, the gameplay was mostly smooth, with frame drops being noticeable only once in a while. With PubG, the game did show some. Stutter was evident especially when using a scope and the game in general ran at medium graphic settings. You could get away with a decent round in Pochinki if you close all background processes, which is the best you can get on an Android phone with 4GB RAM. Casual gaming on the other hand would be absolutely fine, as we have experienced from hours of playing Bouncing Hoops, Subway Surfer etc., When it comes to performance, the ground reality is that for most uses, the Realme U1 manages to maintain a smooth user experience. For example, as a student, you will be able to browse and research your topics of study with ease. You will also be able to relax with a casual gaming session, and edit photos using Snapseed. However, if you’re going to rely on this phone for heavy gaming like playing PubG, you may want to invest a little more for the 6GB variant., The Realme U1 sports a dual camera assembly on the back which includes a 12-megapixel camera shooting through a lens with an f/2.2 aperture and a secondary 2 megapixel depth camera. The aperture on the depth camera is f/2.4. While testing the camera of the Realme U1, the first thing that stands out is the good shutter response. There is little to no lag here, which is good. However, there are times when the camera is still looking for the right object to focus on, causing a just barely noticeable delay in taking the shot., The daylight performance of the camera was surprisingly good. The detail retention was surprisingly good, although not quiet at a level where we would be blown away. What is evident is though is that the horrible JPG compression isn’t prevalent., , , Shooting photos indoors in semi-low light are also surprisingly decent for a phone in this price segment. While there is noticeable loss in detail in indoor shots, the photos do present themselves without any noise. The dynamic range in all photos also presents at an adequate level. The portrait also does a decent job of subject separation and the amount of background separation, although, the amount of background blur cannot be adjusted.,  The highlight of the Realme U1 is the selfie camera, which is a 25-megapixel Sony IMX 576 unit. Realme is betting on the U1 to be a selfie-centric smartphone and as such, does offer the usual slew of features such as a user-definable beauty mode. The optics are also designed rather well, being resistant to significant flaring when shooting against bright light. Skin detail is obviously lost with or without beautification filters. , , What was interesting to note in the camera app was the lack of access to settings. There is no way to select what aspect ratio you want to shoot photos in and neither is there any ability to change video resolution or frame rates. Even the slow-motion setting is fixed and you won’t really know what fps or resolution its shooting at. This, in our opinion, is a massive omission. Even if there are no settings to change, it would have been nice to know the resolutions and aspect ratios the photos and videos are being shot at. The only tweakable setting is the ability to turn Beauty AI on/off and the ability to apply a filter effect to photos. , You can see more image samples in our FLICKR gallery here., Overall, while quality of the photos produced by the front and rear camera are decent, a lack of settings means there is no flexibility in the output.

2355,,realme-1-128gb-review-131185,0,0,2019-05-22,131185,Subhrojit Mallick,RealMe 1 128GB Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/realme-1-128gb-review-131185.html,"The good looks of the Realme 1 hides the inconsistencies of the phone. It tries to get ahead of the game by gaming the synthetic benchmarks but falls flat in real world performance. It positions itself as a selfie-centric phone but the selfies from the phone comes off as artificial and puffed up., , Oppo has been a player in the Indian smartphone market for quite some time now. The China-based company, owned by BBK Electronics has positioned itself more as a premium brand in the country. Most of Oppo’s offerings have been more or less expensive with a strong emphasis on selfies. One could say Oppo’s offerings are more of a lifestyle device than just a piece of technology. However, the highest demand in the smartphone market in India is for mid-range phones that are low on price and high on features. Oppo wanted a piece of the mid-range cake, but being a premium brand, it can’t just come out with a cheap phone. Hence the brand, Realme. Just like what Xiaomi did with the Redmi brand, Realme wants to do the same for Oppo., Realme U1 Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, But whether the bet of introducing a new brand will pay off for Oppo or not is fodder for another discussion. The focus right now is whether Realme 1, the first phone under the new sub-brand is an attractive proposition. The phone certainly look different and the diamond black flair adds to the premium charm of it., The Realme 1 launched in India exclusively to take on the Redmi Note 5 Pro, but how far does it go to settle the argument? We find out., Design, The Realme 1 looks distinctly different from all other phones at its price, thanks to the diamond-like reflective body. The phone is housed inside a fibre-glass casing that has been cut at different angles such that each section of the glass back turns to a different shade of black when light is reflecting off it. It does look a lot like a diamond. If you like your gadgets shiny and glossy, this phone will catch your eye. The same glossy finish runs along the edges as well., , The front is all screen. There are no capacitive navigation button on the front. Even the fingerprint sensor is missing. The Realme 1 relies only on facial recognition for authentication.  It’s a brave move by a brand that’s taking its first plunge in a highly competitive market, and other than just being perceived as future forward, it’s actually detrimental to the experience. The user loses out on the reliability of the fingerprint when authenticating purchases. The face unlock is quick, but isn’t reliable enough to keep user’s data secure. You can use facial authentication to access the private space (where you can store apps and data securely), and private apps (that are password-locked). In a practical scenario, the phone was unlocked by a colleague by simply pointing it at my face from a distance., Apart from the diamond-black finish, it’s a pretty straightforward phone. It rocks the in-vogue univisium form factor and is just 7.8mm thick. There’s an ugly bulge along the edge of the phone that messes with the grip. The screen takes up most of the real-estate up front. The screen-to-body ratio is around 84 percent, which Realme managed to do by fitting the usual 6-inch display in a smaller 6.14-inch frame. The phone is offered in two more colours — Red and silver, but that will be available later in June., Display, The Realme 1 sports a standard-issue 6-inch Full HD+ display of 18:9 aspect ratio. The panel is just about average with decent colour reproduction. The colour tones are slightly on the cooler side and brightness isn’t high enough to be visible properly when outdoors. In fact, there’s some colour loss at peak brightness and texts appear faded under direct sunlight. The panel quiet reflective too. You get the usual blue-light filters and options to tweak the colour temperature., , The good part about the panel is that it takes up most of the real estate up front with minimal bezels on the top and the bottom. The sides are also quite thin, which gives off an immersive feel to the content., Performance and UI, The Realme 1 wants to be the phone of choice for mid-range buyers. The undercutting price point is one instance where it shows. But more than that, it’s the brand’s attempt to beat the best in its maiden attempt that brings out the competitive attitude of the company., The Realme 1 is powered by the MediaTek Helio P60 SoC which is MediaTek’s most advanced chipset. It comes with an AI chip inside that can compute machine learning tasks on the device itself. It is what powers the facial recognition and the battery efficiency, apart from other things. It’s an octa-core chipset built on a 12nm FinFET process with four Cortex A53 and four Cortex A73 cores, all clocked at 2GHz frequency. On paper it’s faster than its Qualcomm counterpart, as the benchmark results from AnTuTu 7.0 and Geekbench will state. However, when I monitored how the chipset was being used, I observed some anomaly. It seemed for both the benchmark tests, which is comprised of multiple small tasks that stress the CPU to measure performance, the chipset was running at a constant 2.0GHz, irrespective whether the load on the CPU was minimal or at its peak. It could either be an anomaly with the unit I received or Realme is gaming a popular benchmark tests. In a more real world scenario, when the performance was measured while playing the new PubG Mobile game, the CPU speed matched the load put on it. The AnTuTu score for the Realme 1 was 138260 against the Redmi Note 5 Pro’s 112652. The Geekbench Single Core and Multi Core scores are also higher at 1490 and 5682 respectively. But in both cases, the CPU was artificially plonked up to eke out a better score., , We performed a similar analysis on the Redmi Note 5 Pro which proved to be more consistent in responding to CPU load both during synthetic benchmark tests and real world scenarios. The Realme 1’s anomaly seems a little too deliberative. Nevertheless, there’s 6GB RAM and 128GB storage on the unit we re. It leaves enough resources free despite a heavy user interface. It also support dual VoLTE which is useful in the Indian context., The Realme 1 relies on Oppo’s Colour OS. It’s definitely functional like all Android-layered user interfaces these days, but I wouldn’t call it particularly appealing. It lacks the attention to detail that MIUI is known or the simplicity of stock Android. Instead, the UI seems cluttered with disproportional icons and overall looks quite cartoonish. It does come with a game mode, a private space and the usual bells and whistles of Android Oreo, but that doesn’t take away the fact how uninviting the UI looks for a nitpicking user., Camera, The fate of smartphones these days is decided by how good the camera is. The Realme 1, in that section, is quite underwhelming in comparison to the competition. It has a single 13-megapixel sensor at the back while on the front is an 8-megapixel shooter. The focus, unsurprisingly, is on selfies and portrait shots. The phone relies on Oppo’s AI algorithms to fine-tune the photos which the company claims works by analysing 296 recognition points to understand the skin tone, age, gender, etc. Based on that analysis, the phone applies one of 8 million ‘beauty solutions’ to the image., , The end result is simply a photo with extreme layers of softening, so much so, that all spots and blemishes are hidden. It was a tad difficult for me to accept the effects, but I suppose there’s a demand for them in a country where fairness creams are one of the highest selling products. If beautification is what you’re seeking from a smartphone camera, the Realme 1 will be a pure delight. But if you’re a little more serious about taking good photos, the phone might leave you hanging., , In daylight, the photos have ample highlight clipping. There’s practically no detail in the bright sky in the photo below. Furthermore, the camera tends to saturate the colours more than they are in reality. It also lacks the desired dynamic range., , Indoor shots are a little more polished. The controlled light brings out the good side of the camera. There’s more controlled AI enhancement and the little that it does, it makes objects look much better than they are in real. You get good sharp images with a slightly warmer white balance. There’s some glare off the source of light though, which might be a lens issue., Under low light, the camera fails to show much promise. Grains show up if you try to dial the exposure higher to take an image under poor lighting, with little to no detail. The shutter speed is actually dialled up when there’s less light which demands a steady hand and if the object is moving, you get a blurred photo., The portrait mode is present both on the front and the back camera. The Realme 1 relies on software to simulate the depth-of-field effect. It’s nowhere as consistent as the Redmi Note 5 Pro, but it does the job as far as blurring the background is concerned., , Battery, The Realme 1 is powered by a 3410mAh battery. For those comparing, that’s a hairline more than what Xiaomi’s best mid-range phone offers, and the battery life of the phone is more or less at par. The phone managed to run for 6 hours on the PCMark Battery 2.0 Test which should easily convert to over a day’s usage for an average user. For the review, I used the phone to browse the internet, play games, take photos and use social media. It did last me for a typical work day and then some more. The Helio P60 chipset seems to be quite energy-efficient and based on the battery life, Realme seems to be delivering on its promise of using machine learning to manage resources. The battery section in the Settings app gives some insight in how much juice each app takes and apart from the resource-intensive game I was playing, the UI sucked up most of the battery. When you are running out of power on this phone, you know what to blame., , Bottomline, The debutante Realme 1’s ambition to compete with the likes of Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro is quite apparent. It looks boldly different from the rest, but a good design will only take it so far. The performance is nowhere near the best in the market, despite the benchmark results telling you so. The camera which is propped up by on-device machine learning ends up delivering unnaturally softened photos while the UI comes off quite amateurish.  The battery life is the only saving grace, but overall this phone isn’t what it advertises to be. Oppo’s decision to come out with a new sub-brand to cater to the highly competitive mid-range market may be driven by consumer demand, but there’s little in the phone to entice buyers, apart from a good looking device."
2355,,realme-1-128gb-review-131185,0,0,2019-05-22,131185,Subhrojit Mallick,RealMe 1 128GB Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/realme-1-128gb-review-131185.html,"The good looks of the Realme 1 hides the inconsistencies of the phone. It tries to get ahead of the game by gaming the synthetic benchmarks but falls flat in real world performance. It positions itself as a selfie-centric phone but the selfies from the phone comes off as artificial and puffed up., , Oppo has been a player in the Indian smartphone market for quite some time now. The China-based company, owned by BBK Electronics has positioned itself more as a premium brand in the country. Most of Oppo’s offerings have been more or less expensive with a strong emphasis on selfies. One could say Oppo’s offerings are more of a lifestyle device than just a piece of technology. However, the highest demand in the smartphone market in India is for mid-range phones that are low on price and high on features. Oppo wanted a piece of the mid-range cake, but being a premium brand, it can’t just come out with a cheap phone. Hence the brand, Realme. Just like what Xiaomi did with the Redmi brand, Realme wants to do the same for Oppo., Realme U1 Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, But whether the bet of introducing a new brand will pay off for Oppo or not is fodder for another discussion. The focus right now is whether Realme 1, the first phone under the new sub-brand is an attractive proposition. The phone certainly look different and the diamond black flair adds to the premium charm of it., The Realme 1 launched in India exclusively to take on the Redmi Note 5 Pro, but how far does it go to settle the argument? We find out., Design, The Realme 1 looks distinctly different from all other phones at its price, thanks to the diamond-like reflective body. The phone is housed inside a fibre-glass casing that has been cut at different angles such that each section of the glass back turns to a different shade of black when light is reflecting off it. It does look a lot like a diamond. If you like your gadgets shiny and glossy, this phone will catch your eye. The same glossy finish runs along the edges as well., , The front is all screen. There are no capacitive navigation button on the front. Even the fingerprint sensor is missing. The Realme 1 relies only on facial recognition for authentication.  It’s a brave move by a brand that’s taking its first plunge in a highly competitive market, and other than just being perceived as future forward, it’s actually detrimental to the experience. The user loses out on the reliability of the fingerprint when authenticating purchases. The face unlock is quick, but isn’t reliable enough to keep user’s data secure. You can use facial authentication to access the private space (where you can store apps and data securely), and private apps (that are password-locked). In a practical scenario, the phone was unlocked by a colleague by simply pointing it at my face from a distance., Apart from the diamond-black finish, it’s a pretty straightforward phone. It rocks the in-vogue univisium form factor and is just 7.8mm thick. There’s an ugly bulge along the edge of the phone that messes with the grip. The screen takes up most of the real-estate up front. The screen-to-body ratio is around 84 percent, which Realme managed to do by fitting the usual 6-inch display in a smaller 6.14-inch frame. The phone is offered in two more colours — Red and silver, but that will be available later in June., Display, The Realme 1 sports a standard-issue 6-inch Full HD+ display of 18:9 aspect ratio. The panel is just about average with decent colour reproduction. The colour tones are slightly on the cooler side and brightness isn’t high enough to be visible properly when outdoors. In fact, there’s some colour loss at peak brightness and texts appear faded under direct sunlight. The panel quiet reflective too. You get the usual blue-light filters and options to tweak the colour temperature., , The good part about the panel is that it takes up most of the real estate up front with minimal bezels on the top and the bottom. The sides are also quite thin, which gives off an immersive feel to the content., Performance and UI, The Realme 1 wants to be the phone of choice for mid-range buyers. The undercutting price point is one instance where it shows. But more than that, it’s the brand’s attempt to beat the best in its maiden attempt that brings out the competitive attitude of the company., The Realme 1 is powered by the MediaTek Helio P60 SoC which is MediaTek’s most advanced chipset. It comes with an AI chip inside that can compute machine learning tasks on the device itself. It is what powers the facial recognition and the battery efficiency, apart from other things. It’s an octa-core chipset built on a 12nm FinFET process with four Cortex A53 and four Cortex A73 cores, all clocked at 2GHz frequency. On paper it’s faster than its Qualcomm counterpart, as the benchmark results from AnTuTu 7.0 and Geekbench will state. However, when I monitored how the chipset was being used, I observed some anomaly. It seemed for both the benchmark tests, which is comprised of multiple small tasks that stress the CPU to measure performance, the chipset was running at a constant 2.0GHz, irrespective whether the load on the CPU was minimal or at its peak. It could either be an anomaly with the unit I received or Realme is gaming a popular benchmark tests. In a more real world scenario, when the performance was measured while playing the new PubG Mobile game, the CPU speed matched the load put on it. The AnTuTu score for the Realme 1 was 138260 against the Redmi Note 5 Pro’s 112652. The Geekbench Single Core and Multi Core scores are also higher at 1490 and 5682 respectively. But in both cases, the CPU was artificially plonked up to eke out a better score., , We performed a similar analysis on the Redmi Note 5 Pro which proved to be more consistent in responding to CPU load both during synthetic benchmark tests and real world scenarios. The Realme 1’s anomaly seems a little too deliberative. Nevertheless, there’s 6GB RAM and 128GB storage on the unit we re. It leaves enough resources free despite a heavy user interface. It also support dual VoLTE which is useful in the Indian context., The Realme 1 relies on Oppo’s Colour OS. It’s definitely functional like all Android-layered user interfaces these days, but I wouldn’t call it particularly appealing. It lacks the attention to detail that MIUI is known or the simplicity of stock Android. Instead, the UI seems cluttered with disproportional icons and overall looks quite cartoonish. It does come with a game mode, a private space and the usual bells and whistles of Android Oreo, but that doesn’t take away the fact how uninviting the UI looks for a nitpicking user., Camera, The fate of smartphones these days is decided by how good the camera is. The Realme 1, in that section, is quite underwhelming in comparison to the competition. It has a single 13-megapixel sensor at the back while on the front is an 8-megapixel shooter.

2357,,realme-2-pro-128gb-review-161608,0,0,2019-05-22,161608,Subhrojit Mallick,Realme 2 Pro 128GB Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/realme-2-pro-128gb-review-161608.html,"The Realme 2 Pro undercuts its rivals by introducing a top-of-the-line mid-range chipset from Qualcomm at a price never before seen. Further, it also sports the latest notched design and a laminated glass body. In comparison to many other phones, the Realme 2 Pro certainly looks enticing, but like everything else, it's not perfect either. Read the full review to find out., , The mid-range segment is rarely about design. Even rarer is the combination of high performance and good looks. It’s usually either of the two, but not in the Realme 2 Pro. The newly formed brand by Oppo has had a good run this year, launching devices for all the high-volume segments. The Realme 1 set the pace for the brand and the Realme 2 capitalised on it, but it’s the Realme 2 Pro that the brand has been building up to this year, and it’s easily enticing. The Realme 2 Pro packs a top-of-the-line mid-range Qualcomm chipset for as low as Rs 13,990 replete with a next-generation notched display and a laminated glass design. Such features are usually restricted for the more expensive offerings, but Realme has managed to bring it down to the thrifty folks., Realme 3 Pro Review, Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, The Realme 2 Pro punches way above its belt considering the features on paper. But with established incumbents like the Xiaomi Mi A2, Honor Play and convincing new entrants like the Moto One Power on the prowl, does it have enough for the feature-hungry Indian smartphone buyer to be satisfied? Let’s find out., , Realme, as a brand, is quite focussed on making the latest design innovations more affordable. It started with a diamond-cut glass design with the Realme 1, followed by the notch on the Realme 2. Now on the Realme 2 Pro, it implements the valley-shaped notch which the company calls ‘Dewdrop notch’. It’s shaped like a water droplet, much like the Oppo F9 Pro and the Vivo V11 Pro, both of which are ultimately owned by the same parent company — BBK Electronics. It’s easy to see how the achievements of design R&D is trickling down to all the brands under the parent company. As a result of the tiny cutout on the screen, the screen real estate is now much more than usual, a whopping 90.8 percent of the body. The phone also shaves off the bezels to a minimum from all sides making the panel feel truly immersive., The rear part of the phone is laminated in multiple layers giving it a glass-like surface. The underlying material seems to be toughened polycarbonate. Realme claims it offers resistance to heat and scratches, but is quite the smudge magnet. You do get a case that has flaps to protect the USB port and the headphone jack. The phone is also quite thick at 8.5mm and bulky at 174 grams, but not as unweildy as the Moto One Power. It’s easy to hold although the laminated layers don’t stretch to the edges leaving them quite rough. The display is also a bit raised from the body and I have doubts it can take the damage from a full-frontal drop. Realme, however, claims the display is protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 panel on top. The dual camera unit at the back is also a bit raised from the body leaving it exposed to damage in case of a fall. Realme does claim to have performed a range of durability tests, but they are all lab-simulated and may not be reflective of real world abuse., The Realme 2 Pro, overall, looks much more refined than the average Xiaomi phone or even the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1. Between this and the Nokia 6.1 Plus though, I prefer the latter for its seamless, compact design., Update: We had earlier mentioned the Realme 2 Pro has the Widevine L1 certification required to stream Netflix content in HD. It actually has L3 certification. We regret the inconvinience caused. , , The Realme 2 Pro features a 6.3 -inch IPS LCD fullHD+ display. Thanks to the new notch, it’s also quite big and offers a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. The smaller notch makes more space for the status bar icons, but all apps aren’t optimised for the new size. It’s only a matter of time as more phones are expected to sport a similar design. The Realme 2 Pro is also Widevine L3 certified and can't stream Netflix and Amazon Prime Video content in high definition, similar to other Xiaomi and Honor devices. The panel is also quite bright and vibrant and watching movies is a pleasurable experience. The recorded brightness of the panel came to be around 512 lux which is enough to make the content legible under direct sunlight., Realme offers options to adjust the colour temperature, which is on the cooler side by default, along with turning on the blue light filter. Now that the notch has shrunk in size, Realme has removed the option to hide it which could be a bummer for some. The notched area does house extra information like shortcuts to pre-fixed apps while watching a video or playing a game., The extra screen space comes handy when you’re playing a game, although games like PubG Mobile are not yet adapted to it and a tiny portion of the screen gets cropped out (including the controls by default). YouTube and Netflix  too aren’t optimised and the video wraps around the notch., The Realme 2 Pro’s display is one of the highlights of the phone, and if you’re annoyed by the notched displays available in that price range, this is a good option to go for., The Realme 2 Pro manages to bring the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 chipset down to the under-15k price range. It was earlier reserved for more expensive phones with the likes of the Nokia 7.1 Plus, Vivo V11 Pro and the Xiaomi Mi A2. The base variant’s competition are mostly powered by the Snapdragon 636, and it is in this segment, that the Realme 2 Pro topples the rest in terms of performance. That certainly would have been a commendable achievement, but just like the Realme 1, the Realme 2 Pro also cheats on benchmarks by running the chipset at its max clock speed at all times while running a benchmark app., , , We found the Realme 2 Pro performs abnormally fast for all the benchmark apps we use to grade smartphones — Geekbench, AnTuTu, 3DMark and GFX Bench. In all of them, the Snapdragon 660 was programmed to run on peak clock speed even when the load on the processor was lesser. It’s exactly what we had seen back in the Realme 1. A recent investigation also revealed the Realme 2 and other phones from Oppo are also doing the same. The investigation was based on a private app provided by UL, the company behind popular benchmarking app 3D Mark. We haven’t managed to get our hands on the privately signed app yet. Once we do, we will perform the same tests to see if the results corroborate. Now, it’s true that benchmark numbers don’t really convert to stable real-world usage, but companies like Realme, Oppo and Huawei rely on these numbers heavily to market their devices. Being lied to is never a good thing, and despite being a high-performing phone for the price range it’s offered at, the Realme 2 Pro seems untrustworthy. If the company isn’t confident about it’s own performance, who knows what else they are hiding under the shiny exterior?, The Snapdragon 660 has proven to be quite a powerful performer though. It can handle most of tasks a phone will perform on a daily basis — social media browsing, taking photos, high-speed LTE connectivity, multi-tasking and more. The  Realme 2 Pro too can grind through most of these tasks without a hitch. The polished ColosOS 5.2 UI, despite being on the heavier side, doesn’t slow down the phone. I had multiple apps launched in the background, and still the phone performed fine., Games like PubG Mobile, Asphalt 9 and Injustice 2, all ran smoothly. PubG Mobile ran on medium graphics but there wasn’t a noticeable drop in frame-rates. The phone also supports Dual 4G and Dual Standby which means you can keep playing  on your data connection, even when you receive a call., , The Realme 2 Pro runs on ColorOS 5.2. It’s Oppo’s latest version of its user interface and looks quite different from stock Android. It’s far more polished though from the previous versions and houses a lot of customisable features that will keep an enthusiast busy for months. There’s still no app drawer though, and the icons are rather large. Installing too many clutters the homescreen to the point that the wallpaper in the background is barely legible. Some argue that the apps are  easily accessible, but try finding that one app you’re looking for among a bunch of other similarly looking icons and you’ll understand my frustration., The Realme 2 Pro offers a dedicated gaming mode that disables alerts and boosts the performance. There’s face unlock that also works quite fast (no idea how secure it is though), there’s a sidebar housing customisable shortcuts and gesture-based actions. All of these features are not found in a phone powered by stock Android and is a strong argument in favour of custom ROMs., , The Realme 2 Pro also managed to impress with its camera capabilities at its grand launch. Like most mid-rangers, it also sports dual cameras on the back. The primary camera has a Sony IMX398 16MP sensor which Sony developed in collaboration with Oppo. This sensor powers quite a few selfie-centric Oppo phones and the older OnePlus 5 and the OnePlus 5T. The lens has f/1.7 aperture while the sensor size is 1/2.8"" with 1.12um pixels. It’s quite capable in producing good shots, but I wasn’t a fan of Realme’s beautifying filters on portraits. There’s also a secondary 2MP depth sensor along with the primary sensor to produce bokeh shots. Up front is another 16MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture., , , The Realme 2 Pro can take bright and vibrant photos with ample sunlight. The colours like red and blue pop out of the frame with high contrast and high saturation, while details on far-away buildings can be made out easily. The dynamic range, like most other phones in its segment, leaves a lot to be desired., , , The Realme 2 Pro is also quite capable in taking good photos indoors. The colour saturation and contrast is also higher in this and that helps in making the photos look more palatable. You can see the results for yourself., , Surprisingly, the Realme 2 Pro is quite capable in taking low-light shots. There’s lesser grains as compared to other phones in that price range, while the colours are preserved to a certain degree. There’s lesser details in the shadows though, but that is expected for a phone in this price range., The Realme 2 Pro carries Oppo’s DNA of taking good selfies. By good, I mean the smoothened beauty effects that Oppo’s algorithms apply to make your face glow and look more vibrant. While that does make you look good to a certain extent, most of the facial details are lost in the process. It’s good for social media traction, but not much for smartphone photography enthusiasts., , The Realme 2 Pro, thanks to the energy-efficient processor and a 3,500mAh battery last well over a day. In our PCMark Work 2.0 battery test, the Realme 2 Pro lasted 9 hours 29 minutes. That’s surprisingly a lot as compared to other phones with similar battery sizes. However, the Realme 2 with a larger 4,230mAh battery outlasts the Realme 2 Pro., I used the phone to take photos, browse the web and social media, watch a few episodes and more, and managed to make it last well over a day. The phone charges using a regular 5V/2A charger that can charge the phone to 15 percent in around 15 minutes. There’s no support fast charging even though the Snapdragon 660 comes with support for Quick Charge 4.0., The Realme 2 Pro is certainly powerful. It also looks different from the usual crop of metal-body phones. But the company doesn’t seem to be confident enough in its performance as showed by the fudged benchmark scores. It runs almost everything you throw at it without much of a hitch and the refined UI adds to the polished experience of the phone. But if you ask me, the 8GB RAM and  128GB storage variant doesn’t seem all that enticing considering the restraints put forth by the processor. Further, with a dedicated slot to expand storage by upto 256GB, there really is no need to get the top most variant here. Instead, if you have a budget of around Rs 14,000, this phone is a no-brainer."
2490,,realme-3-pro-review-181343,0,0,2019-05-22,181343,Subhrojit Mallick,Realme 3 Pro Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/realme-3-pro-review-181343.html,"The Realme 3 Pro certainly lives up to the “Pro” moniker. It’s significantly more powerful and faster than the regular Realme 3, but that’s not its competition. The Realme  3 Pro’s closest rival is the Redmi Note 7 Pro and the company CEO Madhav Seth left no stone unturned to compare the device to Xiaomi’s best-seller. To be fair, both phones are incredible close in terms of both performance and camera. The UI is vastly different and while the Redmi Note 7 Pro offers ads on the homescreen, the Realme 3 Pro has greatly improved UI aesthetics. Finally, the Realme 3 Pro is perhaps the best gaming phone under Rs 15,000, and as a result, it is the perfect alternative to the Redmi Note 7 Pro which is focused on more on the camera., , Just a year back, Realme was announced as a sub-brand of Oppo in India, and ever since then, the now-independent brand has not looked back. In 2019, Realme announced new phones every two months or so, and the Realme 3 Pro is the latest offering. There’s already a Realme 3 in the market, so what makes this one a ‘pro?’. For one, it introduces the Snapdragon 710 in the mid-range segment. It also uses the same camera as that of the OnePlus 6T (priced over Rs 35,000), and offers a high-capacity battery with support for super-fast charging. All that combined certainly makes the Realme 3 Pro an enticing option to look out for when buying a new phone, but is it really the best mid-ranger available right now? Read on to find out., Realme U1 Review, Huawei Mate 20 Pro 128GB Review, Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, , The Realme 3 Pro stresses heavily on speed, so much so, that the rear panel is designed with an S-curve which is apparently a tribute to the S-shaped track of Le Mans, the legendary Grand Prix circuit. The pattern is evident in the blue gradient shades that the phone emanates when held against light. Personally, I felt the design comes off a little too gaudy and isn’t quite something I’d spend money on. The more demure purple and grey variant look much better though., , The phone is also surprisingly slim considering it packs a 4,000mAh battery. The rear panel which seems to be made of resin, curves gently around the edges to reduce the thickness,  offering a tighter grip. The form-factor makes it just enough for my thumb to reach the other end of the display, so I wouldn’t rule out one-handed use for people with larger hands. The fingerprint sensor is fairly responsive and is mounted on the back along the center while the camera unit is arranged vertically on the top left corner. Thankfully, there’s no significant camera bump as the module is encased inside a silver-coloured enclosure., The Realme 3 Pro certainly looks good from the back. From the front however, it’s identical to its predecessor with a waterdrop notch and a nearly bezel-less display. The screen-to-body ratio is also similar to the Realme 2 Pro and so is the micro-USB for charging. There’s also a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio. There is a single speaker grill on the bottom while the earpiece is placed right above the notch., , What’s worrying is that the frame of the phone is not quite robust. A single tumble from my hand was enough to leave ugly scars on the frame from  where it hit the ground and the colours chipped away. The display was saved though, thanks to the presence of Gorilla Glass 5. Realme does bundle a case in the box which will render further protection from drops., , The Realme 3 Pro essentially has the same waterdrop notched IPS LCD display as its predecessor. It stretches to 6.3-inches diagonally and offers decent viewability. It’s certainly not the best display that’s on offer in the sub-15,000 range. That accolade goes to the Samsung Galaxy M30 with its Super AMOLED panel. The one on the Realme 3 Pro, however, is perfectly usable., , The panel takes up most of the real-estate up front but there are distinct bezels on the bottom. The shrunken notch also helps free up space for content. Effectively, thanks to a smaller notch, the display can now fit more icons on the status bar than before., Despite a FullHD display, The Realme 3 Pro unit we received had Widevine L3 DRM rating which means you won’t be able to stream content from Netflix,  Hotstar and other streaming services in HD. Realme said the DRM rating will be upgraded via an OTA update. However, that doesn’t mean you will be able to stream DRM-protected content in full HD as the streaming services have to manually enable support for the device to let it stream in higher resolution. The Poco F1 which went through a similar OTA update for its Widevine certification still hasn’t been certified by many streaming services., , , While streaming content on the Realme 3 Pro is a bummer, gaming is what this phone is really made for. The expansive display is perfect for a round of PUBG Mobile as the entire panel is used up, giving a lot more space for moving your fingers. It’s also sufficiently bright at 457 lux at peak brightness. The brightness rating is slightly lower than the Realme 2 Pro, even though this seems to be the same display and we’re not quite sure why that’s the case., , The display also has a slightly colder white-balance, making most content appear just a smidge bluer than normal. The phone gives the option to tweak the colour-temperature from cooler to warmer, but these are preset settings and fudges up the colour temperature even more. You do get the option to turn on Night Mode and change font sizes. The colours come out  slightly boosted and the blacks seem to look darker on the Realme 3 Pro than in the Redmi Note 7 Pro., Overall, the Realme 3 Pro has a perfectly usable display, but it’s certainly not the best in its segment., , It’s what’s under the hood that makes Realme 3 Pro earn the ‘Pro’ moniker. The device introduces the Snapdragon 710 to the mid-range segment, which supposedly bridges the gap between mid-range and high-end chipsets. By doing so, the Realme 3 Pro certainly manages to make heads turn even while the Redmi Note 7 Pro has been topping performance charts everywhere. It certainly sounds powerful, but is it the fastest phone around in that segment?, CPU Benchmarks, , , On AnTuTu, the Realme 3 Pro scored 154810, which is significantly lesser than what the Redmi Note 7 Pro achieved. Corroborating the results, the Realme 3 Pro also scored lower on Geekbench Single Core and Multi Core as compared to the Redmi Note 7 Pro. Clearly, the Snapdragon 675 on the Redmi Note 7 Pro has a faster CPU than the Realme 3 Pro. This checks out once again in our Mobile Xprt 2015 scores where the Redmi Note 7 Pro was faster in finishing up all the tasks as compared to the Realme 3 Pro. Finally, PCMark Work 2.0 scores confirmed the Realme 3 Pro is not as fast as the Redmi Note 7 Pro., This, we believe, is because the Snapdragon 675 on the Redmi Note 7 Pro more advanced CPU custom cores based on  ARM Cortex-A76 which also powers the flagship Snapdragon 855.

GPU Benchmarks, , On GPU benchmarks, however, the Realme 3 Pro proved to be an outright winner. On 3DMark Slingshot the Realme 3 Pro scored 2653, as opposed to 1836 by Redmi Note 7 Pro. In the GFXBench tests, the Realme 3 Pro was able to render more frames than the Redmi Note 7 Pro., The Realme 3 Pro’s superiority in GPU benchmarks is primarily due to the fact that the Snapdragon 710 has a more powerful Adreno 616 GPU as compared to the Adreno 612 on the Snapdragon 675 that powers the Redmi Note 7 Pro. This is ironic considering the Snapdragon 675 is advertised as a SoC tuned for gaming., On GPU benchmarks, however, the Realme 3 Pro proved to be an outright winner.

This is ironic considering the Snapdragon 675 is advertised as a SoC tuned for gaming., Gaming, , The GPU benchmark results was an early indication, but on our Gamebench analysis of PUBG Mobile and Asphalt 9, it became clear that the Realme 3 Pro is a better device for gaming, if not the best at its price range. The Realme 3 Pro managed to offer 30 FPS on PUBG Mobile with High graphics and anti-aliasing on. It managed to do so with 99 percent stability. On the other hand, the Redmi Note 7 Pro also managed 30 FPS, but with 96 percent stability., On Asphalt 9, the Realme 3 Pro was more consistent with 29FPS and 88 percent frame rate stability while the Redmi Note 7 Pro’s results were quite disappointing with 18FPS and 50 percent frame-rate stability. We believe the Redmi Note 7 Pro is specifically optimised to handle PUBG Mobile better while other games like Asphalt 9 isn’t quite tuned to make the most of the performance., The Realme 3 Pro doesn’t have any such issues. It managed to run both games almost equally well with PUBG Mobile running particularly smoother. You can reduce the quality of graphics further to get frame rates up to 40 FPS on the device.
Furthermore, when gaming on the Realme 3 Pro, you will not be distracted by incoming notifications. However, if you do have to reply to a text, there’s an option to do so without exiting the game by swiping in from the edges to bring up a quick-launch menu of frequently-used messaging apps. These apps open in a small pop-up that lets you reply without getting out of the game. Cool feature, this.  , Daily Usage, The Snapdragon 710 ensures the Realme 3 Pro doesn’t slow down in daily usage. The phone is offered in three variants with a minimum of 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. The unit we reviewed had 6GB RAM and 128GB storage and there’s also another 6GB RAM with 64GB storage variant. The 6GB RAM variant posted no visible lag or slowdown in our daily usage which involved writing articles, shooting photos and editing them using Snapseed and Lightroom and some gaming and social media browsing. Apps also launched without any noticeable delay and the UI animations have been optimised to run better on the device., The Realme 3 Pro is satisfying to use in daily life with a strong focus on gaming. We also did an in-depth performance comparison of the Redmi Note 7 Pro and the Realme 3 Pro and our primary takeaway was just that. While the Redmi Note 7 Pro manages to do everything well enough, the Realme 3 Pro goes that extra mile to deliver better gaming performance. The company does have a strong fan following of college students and a gaming-optimised offering might just work in Realme’s favour., Software, Part of what made using the Realme 3 Pro a decent experience is the polished interface. It’s far out from the ugly UI of its predecessor. It was my biggest complaint against the Realme 2 Pro and I’m glad that the company has listened to feedback to improve the UI in a big way., , Homescreen, , Minus-1 screen, , App Drawer, The Realme 3 Pro runs on ColorOS 6 based on Android 9 Pie and there’s a marked change in visual aesthetics. For one, the app drawer is now a part of the UI. The icons look more polished and the system animations have been made faster. There’s also a minus-1 screen that houses essential information and it apparently adapts to your usage. But the most important thing that makes the Realme 3 Pro a viable choice is the lack of ads in the phone. Unlike Xiaomi, which has become notorious for popping ads randomly on MIUI, the Realme 3 Pro is devoid of any such thing. It does come with a few additional apps pre-installed like UC Browser, DailyHunt and ShareChat. Thankfully they can be uninstalled., , The Realme 3 Pro’s camera isn’t as feature-rich as that of the Redmi Note 7 Pro, but it’s perfectly usable. The phone pairs the same 16MP Sony IMX519 that’s there on the OnePlus 6T, with a 5MP depth sensor. The primary camera has an aperture of f/1.7 and is able to take fairly detailed shots in both day and night. There’s the usual AI scene recognition on this one too. We noted that the Realme 3 Pro was able to recognise scenes slightly faster than the Redmi Note 7 Pro, and the resulting effect is essentially adding more contrast and saturation to the photos. Then there’s Realme’s proprietary Chroma Boost feature that also increases the colour saturation and contrast to make them look more palatable. While both these features somewhat help enhance the photo quality, the UltraHD feature that combines four 16MP image to create a large-format 64MP photo is interesting, to say the least. It’s a way for Realme to counter the threat of 48MP camera phones without spending more or upgraded hardware. The feature is only available in pro-mode. There’s also Nightscape, that works to improve low-light photos by taking multiple photos in various exposure and merge them to create one photo., Here’s how the camera performs —, Daylight, Daytime images taken with the Realme 3 Pro doesn’t show any noticeable flaws. The photos come out well-exposed with good amount of detail and sharpness. The Realme 3 Pro’s images look slightly cooler though with the blues coming out more prominent. We noticed that the Realme 3 Pro’s images are brighter than the ones taken with the Redmi Note 7 Pro. We’re guessing this is because of the larger aperture., , , Indoors, When shooting indoors, the cooler colour bias becomes more apparent. The colours look significantly cooler. The photos are also enhanced with high contrast and sharpness, and for some, they might look aesthetically better but they’re far from being closer to source., , , Lowlight, Low-light photography has so far been a big differentiator between high-end and mid-range smartphones. The Realme 3 Pro closes the gap by offering decent low-light photos. We used the camera during a trip to Taipei where we shot a few photos in low-light and almost all of them look quite good., Even without using night mode, night scenes come out well-lit and have decent dynamic range. When using the nightmode, the colours and exposure are boosted, but it also brings in a lot more noise. The night mode is especially useful if you’re shooting a photo in low-light with backlit text in the frame., , , , Portrait, Thanks to a dedicated depth sensor, the Realme 3 Pro is quite capable of segregating the foreground from the background. The portrait mode on the phone works well enough to offer better consistency, but the quality of bokeh itself looks artificial. There is also the same boosted contrast effect in work here., , Selfies, Selfies taken with the 25MP front camera come out quite sharp and well-detailed. There’s also minimal highlight clipping. There are various AI effects that you can add to your selfies, each more controversial than the other. There are features like face thinning, reducing the size of your nose, eyes and the likes. Is Realme encouraging users to modify their facial features to feed social media frenzy?, , , UltraHD, While the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro uses an actual 48MP sensor to deliver large-format photos, the Realme 3 Pro also does something similar, albeit using software only. The Realme 3 Pro is capable of delivering 64MP photos, a good 16MP more than what Redmi offers. It does it by taking four 16MP photos in quick succession and merging the accumulated data to offer a 9216x6912 resolution image. Does it offer any significant improvement? Somewhat., , If you look at the sample below, the 64MP image managed to offer more details than the 16MP image could, although the threads around the branch does look quite oversharpened. You can look at the 100 percent crops of the photos to determine., , 100 percent crop (64MP Ultra HD mode), , 100 percent crop (Default 16MP mode),  , , The Pro moniker is given further justice thanks to a high-capacity battery and fast charging. The Realme 3 Pro sports a 4045mAh battery that also supports VOOC 3.0 charging. It’s quite difficult to drain the battery of the phone in a day no matter how extensively you end up using it. And even if you do, VOOC fast charging essentially ensures 50 percent of the battery gets topped up in less than an hour., , In our Geekbench battery test, the Realme 3 Pro took around 11 hours 51 minutes to drain the battery from full charge to two percent. That’s an impressive number and indicates that the phone has enough juice to get you through the day and then some. 30 minutes of streaming Sacred Games drained the battery by just 5 percent while a 15-minute PUBG Mobile session drained the battery from 68 percent to 65 percent. The battery performance is quite similar to what we saw on the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 pro., However, when it comes to charging the high-capacity battery, the Realme 3 Pro is perhaps the fastest of the lot. The phone supports VOOC 3.0 charging which tops up the battery using 25W power. The same tech is used in Oppo phones like the F11 Pro and it’s nice to see a much cheaper, mid-range device pay attention to the small details. The VOOC charger is a huge brick though, same as the Warp Charger that OnePlus bundles. It took approximately 90 minutes to top up the 4045mAh battery on the phone., Bottomline, The Realme 3 Pro certainly lives up to the “Pro” moniker. It’s significantly more powerful and faster than the regular Realme 3, but that’s not its competition. The Realme  3 Pro’s closest rival is the Redmi Note 7 Pro. To be fair, both phones are incredible close in terms of both performance and camera. The UI is vastly different and while the Redmi Note 7 Pro offers ads on the homescreen, the Realme 3 Pro has greatly improved UI aesthetics. Finally, the Realme 3 Pro is perhaps the best gaming phone under Rs 15,000, and as a result, it is the perfect alternative to the Redmi Note 7 Pro which is focused more on the camera.,  "
2484,,samsung-galaxy-a30-review-178963,0,0,2019-05-22,178963,Vignesh Giridharan,Samsung Galaxy A30 Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-a30-review-178963.html,"Despite the occasional performance hiccups, the Samsung Galaxy A30 offers good value overall and a pleasant widescreen video-watching experience for the Rs 16,990 it commands in the market., , For all of us in India summer may be fast approaching but in Samsung’s world, it’s pouring smartphones. The Korean electronics giant shot out within a short span of time its new Galaxy S10 flagship series phones (Galaxy S10, S10+, and S10e), Galaxy M phones (Galaxy M10, M20, and M30), and Galaxy A phones (Galaxy A10, A30, and A50) with signs of more to come., Samsung’s Galaxy A series continues to represent the brand’s mid-range line-up, with three new models ranging from Rs 8,490 to Rs 22,990. The Galaxy A30 positions itself comfortably in the middle at Rs 16,990. Maximising screen-to-body ratio has become a design trend of late and it doesn’t change with the new Galaxy A30., Like its brethren, the Galaxy A30 sports a tiny notch to accommodate only the selfie camera. The software is fully updated with Android 9 Pie running out of the box and Samsung’s new One UI slapped on top of it. Let’s see how the Samsung Galaxy A30 fared in our review., Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, Samsung Galaxy M20 64GB Review, Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Review, Samsung Galaxy S10 Review, , The design of the Samsung Galaxy A30 is nothing out of the ordinary, given its lightweight price tag. It’s got a tall form factor with rounded corners all around. The curved screen fits well around the body of the phone, making the beholder feel the borders around the screen aren’t too thick. The phone’s all-plastic body feels slippery in the hand unless the bundled TPU case is slapped on. Since it’s made of plastic, the rear panel of the phone sports a neat glossy finish, which gives the phone sufficient class. The rear panel is also home to a circular fingerprint scanner, which scans swiftly without missing a single read. In comparison, the more expensive Galaxy A50 comes with an in-display fingerprint scanner., , Unlike the Galaxy A50, the Galaxy A30 gets a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back, The sides of the Galaxy A30 are home to the SIM card/microSD card slot, primary and secondary mics, a 3.5mm audio jack, USB Type-C port, and a single speaker grille. The power key and the volume rocker are placed next to each other and could really use some tactility. Apart from pressing one key for the other by mistake one could also end up pressing the region between Volume Up and Volume Down in the rocker, which is also clickable (for some reason) but does nothing., , Plenty of curves, plent of gloss, , The display on the Samsung Galaxy A30 is the same as that on the more expensive Galaxy A50: a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED Infinity-U unit with a tall aspect ratio of 19.5:9. “Infinity-U” is Samsung-speak for a curved display with a U-shaped notch on top. The tiny notch houses the selfie camera and nothing else, giving the display an overall better look than those with a wide ugly notch on them. The screen resolution is 1080 x 2340 pixels, bringing the pixel density up to a healthy 403 pixels per inch. From the review unit, I could tell that the colours on the Galaxy A30’s display looked bright and vibrant. The screen was bright enough (616 LUX at max brightness) for use in daylight and dim enough (3 LUX at min brightness) for use in bed. Text and images on the AMOLED screen were quite legible even under direct sunlight., , Samsung calls it an ""Infinity-U"" display, Samsung’s software included an option to set the screen mode, which meant I could select between preset colour modes or set the RGB values myself along with the desired colour temperature. It also included One-handed mode, which programmatically reduced the screen size for easy reach of all the buttons. If you use your phone while riding the metro a lot, this will save your life. While YouTube videos zoomed in to fill the “notched” screen pretty well, some games like Ace Force could not, thereby missing out on the edge-to-edge design advantage. Still, I felt that rounding off the corners had made a positive difference to the viewing experience of the display. In summary, the Galaxy A30’s display is—I’m sorry for the pun—top-notch for its price., Audio is a bit of a weak point on the Galaxy A30. Sound from the single side-firing speaker on the phone’s body is loud but tinny. Try showing your friends an electronic song like deadmau5’ Phantoms Can’t Hang and you’ll observe that most of the frequencies jar on the ears, especially lows and mids. Then try playing something less bass-heavy like the acoustic version of Eric Clapton’s Layla, and you’ll realise that even vocals are screechy. The tiny driver on the Galaxy A30 is best reserved for loud and annoying alarms; get yourself a portable Bluetooth speaker if music on the go is your thing., , Audio department could have been stronger, , The Samsung Galaxy A30 is powered by Samsung’s Exynos 7904 chipset that’s built on a 14-nanometre process. The GPU accompanying it is a Mali-G71 MP2. The handset ships in only one variant and that has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage space. Luckily, a microSD card of up to 512GB capacity can be used in it to expand storage. As expected, the benchmark scores of the Galaxy A30 are similar to those of the Galaxy M30, a phone that’s powered by the same Exynos 7904 chipset., The review unit of the Galaxy A30 bagged a score of 94040 in AnTuTu 7.0, 1313 and 4054 in Geekbench’s single-core and multi-core tests respectively, which is only about fifty percent of the score of the ideal benchmark device. In comparison, its competitors like the recently launched Redmi Note 7 Pro, Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2, and Honor 10 Lite scored 179186, 129379, and 130849 respectively in AnTuTu. Their Geekbench scores too are higher. In terms of benchmark figures alone, the Galaxy A30’s closest competitor is the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2., , Everyday activities are handled quite well by the Exynos-powered Galaxy A30. On the review unit, I was able to browse on a dozen open tabs on Chrome while the phone was playing music in the background and installing new apps without too much fuss. Every now and then the animation slowed down and the phone made me wait before loading a screen fully but at no point did the phone freeze completely. During heavy background installations (or when the phone’s disk activity was high basically), even commonly used elements of the phone’s UI saw stutters in animation. For example, pulling the notification drawer down when the phone was downloading game files for Asphalt 8 caused visible stutters., Gaming on the Galaxy A30 review unit was a pleasing experience. There were no signs of lag while playing popular games like Asphalt 8 and PUBG Mobile even when the graphics was set to High. According to Gamebench, the median frame rate was 26 frames per second while playing PUBG Mobile and 30 frames per second while playing Asphalt. Touch response during action sequences remained consistent and natural. The gyros inside worked as expected while playing simulation games like Ace Force. The area around the cameras heated up after about ten minutes of gameplay but not to a point where I became conscious of the heat on the rear panel. In summary, the Galaxy A30 is fit enough to run modern games as long as there’s no other multitasking happening., In summary, the Samsung Galaxy A30 isn’t a dud for everyday activities like browsing, video playback, and some light gaming, but is no quick shooter either. Jitters seen during screen animations are the biggest turn-off about the phone’s performance., , The Samsung Galaxy A30, like all modern Samsung smartphones, runs Android 9 Pie with Samsung’s refreshed One UI thrown on top. Despite the changes made towards a more intuitive user experience, I don’t feel the new One UI on the Galaxy A30 is a big departure from the old TouchWiz. It has the same roundish app icons and rounded rectangles for every menu item, making it look still very much like a Samsung, which is great news for those who like it and not great news for those who expected a big change. The size of the icons and text on the display can be changed in Settings. , I, for one, am not a fan of Samsung software. The review unit booted up with an inundated notification drawer, which put me off instantly. One of the first notifications to pop up right after the first-time setup was, “2 rarely used apps detected”. In the following couple of days, I noticed all sorts of distracting notifications. “Install Samsung Widget. What if you lost your phone? Add your personal pictures to Lock Screen Stories”. Such were the messages I saw in the notification drawer during my few days with the Samsung Galaxy A30. To add to my woes, a certain Samsung Pay mini app kept launching itself automatically in the background from time to time., , Notifications galore on the Galaxy A30, Like I said earlier, if you already are a Samsung Galaxy owner and enjoy the Samsung UI, there’s a chance you’ll like the UI on the Galaxy A30 too. However, if you’ve always preferred stock Android UI, you might end up finding the Samsung UI loud and bloated. While some apps like Dailyhunt can be uninstalled completely, others like Samsung Max and My Galaxy can only be disabled at the risk of system instability., , While the Samsung Galaxy A50 comes equipped with a triple-camera setup, the Samsung Galaxy A30 settles for a dual-camera setup on the back. The dual-camera setup includes a 16-megapixel sensor with an f/1.7 aperture and a 5-megapixel sensor with an f/2.2 aperture. Of the two sensors, the smaller one is an ultra-wide unit with a claimed 123-degree field of view. The selfie camera is a 16-megapixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture. The camera system does not support video recording in 4K resolution but in 1080p at 30 frames per second., Photos of everyday objects like cars and buildings taken in daylight come out quite well on the Galaxy A30. The same photos taken in the ultra-wide mode display slightly blander colours but show a much wider angle. It even creates an obvious fish eye effect. Live Focus mode lets you adjust the level of blur for portrait shots even after the photo has been taken but demands that you focus on a face. “Find a face”, the review unit cried when I tried to focus on the snout of a little pup. Still, the final output from the Live Focus feature is pretty good; it’s hard to tell that the bokeh effect was made by software except in some rare shots. The selfie camera takes decent photos in daylight but attempts to polish (or “beautify”) faces even when the beauty level is set to minimum. There’s nothing very “pro” about the Pro mode except that it lets you adjust white balance, exposure value, and ISO. Photos taken in low light appear, expectedly, grainy and pixelated., , Normal Mode, , Ultra-Wide Mode, , Normal Mode, , Ultra-Wide Mode, , Normal Mode, Indoor, , Live Focus Mode in Low; the good Bokeh effect made Shubham happy, , Live Focus Mode in High; the low Bokeh quality made Shubham sad, , Pro mode lets you set ISO, white balance, and EV compensation, , The selfie camera is eager to ""beautify"" faces, , Indoor selfies are not bad at all, Most of the time, the default camera app on the Samsung Galaxy A30 is slow to react. The image in the viewfinder freezes for half a second every time you ask the phone to switch modes or focus or take a shot. Processing Live Focus shots takes between three and five seconds after the image is taken. In summary, it seems as if the camera app needs to be updated to work better with the hardware available. As it stands, the camera system on the Galaxy A30 is acceptable for the phone’s price but suffers from low reaction speed., The 4,000mAh battery on the Samsung Galaxy A30 gives the phone about one and a half days of life under medium to heavy use. During my time with the review unit, I played games, watched videos, and used common apps like Chrome, Hangouts, and TuneIn extensively. While navigating for thirty minutes (with the screen brightness set to max) the battery dropped only by five percent, which is a healthy rate of drain. Playing PUBG Mobile for about twenty minutes in high graphics settings made the battery drop by six percent, which is also a healthy rate of drain. Charging the handset from 7 to 100 percent took no more than 95 minutes using the bundled 15W quick charger. A long battery life is definitely one of this phone’s strong suits., The Galaxy A30 is Samsung’s honest attempt at a modern mid-range smartphone with all the stuff that clicks in the market right now: tall waterdrop notch display design, dual cameras, and a large battery. Samsung has its own secret ingredient too: it’s using a wide-angle sensor for its secondary rear camera to set itself apart, which works in the Korean electronics company’s favour because it’s been well executed., , There are, however, some things Samsung hasn’t managed to get right on the Galaxy A30, I feel. For example, its Exynos chipset visibly hiccups while multitasking, the audio through the loudspeaker is comparable to that from an old radio, and the UI may not be for everybody. Despite its shortcomings, the Samsung Galaxy A30 proves to be a good buy for the Rs 16,990 it commands.,  ,  ,  ,  ,  ,  "
2461,,samsung-galaxy-m30-review-177425,0,0,2019-05-22,177425,Vignesh Giridharan,Samsung Galaxy M30 Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-m30-review-177425.html,"The Samsung Galaxy M30 is similar to its cousin, the Galaxy A30, in a lot of ways, including performance and camera quality. Where it feels like a step up is exterior design and battery life. Where it feels like a step down is software. It’s still a pretty good buy for Rs 14,990., , In the last two or so months, Samsung has announced a whole bunch of smartphones in India, including refreshed models in the Galaxy S, Galaxy A, and Galaxy M series. While the Galaxy S series continues to represent the Korean electronics company’s flagship range, the Galaxy A and Galaxy M series are two very similar ranges that represent Samsung’s mid-range smartphone models. Understanding the difference between the updated Galaxy A and Galaxy M series can be tricky, considering the similarities in specs and model names, but the latter seems to be spelling “mid-range” more clearly these days, what with the Galaxy A80 now advancing towards pop-up and swiveling cameras., The Samsung Galaxy M30 was announced in India on February 27 with the #IM3XPOWERED hashtag pasted all over social media, indicating the presence of a triple camera setup on the back. The phone was launched in two variants: 4GB RAM + 64GB storage for Rs 14,990 and 6GB RAM + 128GB storage for Rs 17,990. Colour options included were Gradation Blue and Gradation Black. We got the 4GB RAM + 64GB storage variant on our testbed in Gradation BLue, and we got cracking with its tests. Read on to learn how it performed., Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, Samsung Galaxy M20 64GB Review, Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Review, Samsung Galaxy A30 Review, , The build of the Galaxy M30 is quite similar to that of its A-series cousin, the Galaxy A30. It has a smooth rounded finish on all four corners and a back panel that’s made completely of plastic. To add a touch of class to it, Samsung has thrown in a two-tone gradient finish on the back panel; the blue on the back of the phone fades from light to dark gradually along the length of the phone. The result is a phone that both looks and feels good in the hand. Even without any case or cover on, the Galaxy M30 feels grippy in the hands. What’s more, the back panel remains mostly free of smudges and fingerprint marks. That said, you wouldn’t want to hold this phone right after feasting on an oily samosa., , While the top side of the Galaxy M30 houses just the secondary microphone, the left side is home to the SIM and microSD card slot. The bottom side gets a 3.5mm audio jack, a USB Type-C port for charging and data transfer, and a single-grille loudspeaker. That leaves the right side of the phone to house the power button and volume rocker, which are well placed and comfortable to press. Those who aren’t a fan of Samsung’s proprietary virtual assistant Bixby will be happy to note that there’s no dedicated Bixby key on the Galaxy M30’s body. The back panel is home to a vertically aligned triple camera setup, a single LED flash, and a fingerprint scanner, which, in my opinion, is placed way too high up for easy reach. In summary, the Galaxy M30 is built and designed quite well for its price., , , Like the Galaxy A30, the Galaxy M30 has a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with an aspect ratio of 19.5:9 and a resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels. Like some of the other models in the Galaxy A and Galaxy M series, the Galaxy M30 is blessed with Samsung’s “Infinity-U” display, which means that it gets a high screen-to-body ratio of over 90 percent and a tiny U-shaped notch at the top to accommodate the single selfie camera. Pixel count on the display is approximately 400 pixels per inch, which is definitely healthy by today’s standards., , The colours on Galaxy M30’s display appear full and rich. In addition, the software allows the colours to be set to a cooler or warmer temperature. The screen is dim enough to be used in bed and bright enough to be used indoors. The minimum brightness is 3 LUX and the maximum brightness is 560 LUX. In comparison, the Galaxy A30 and Galaxy M20 have a maximum screen brightness of 616 LUX and 537 LUX respectively. Content on the Galaxy M30’s display isn’t viewable under direct sunlight but that’s forgiable, given that sunlight legibility is quite hard to achieve anyway. In summary, the Galaxy M30’s display is surely up to the mark, considering its price in the market. I just wish the software had an option to lower the screen resolution by just one notch (sorry for the unintended pun); that would have helped save more battery., , Sound from the Galaxy M30’s single down-firing loudspeaker is moderately loud. The driver inside is good enough for ringtones and alarm tones but not fit for high-quality music. At maximum volume, you can observe signs of tearing and distortion in high frequencies. Bass, on the other hand, is tinny, and therefore produces poor “thump” effect for songs like Starboy by The Weeknd. If you’re a fan of music on the go it’s worth getting a portable Bluetooth speaker along with the phone. On the other hand, the earpiece is loud and clear enough for calls even in noisy environments like a crowded canteen., , As you may have guessed by now, the Galaxy M30 shares its Exynos 7904 chipset with the Galaxy A30. The Exynos chipset, built on a 14-nanometre process, has an octa-core processor. There are two high-performance Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 1.8GHz and six high-efficiency Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.6GHz. The GPU is a Mali-G71 MP2, the same as that on the Galaxy A30. All this is combined with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM, depending on the variant you pick. The storage on board can be expanded to a maximum of up to 512GB using a microSD card, which gets a dedicated slot along with the two SIM cards., The Galaxy M30 review unit fared more or less as well as the Galaxy A30 and Galaxy M20 on our CPU and GPU benchmark tests. On AnTuTu 7.0, the Galaxy M30 trumped the Galaxy A30 by 13665 points but lost to the Galaxy M20 by 187 points. On PCMark Storage, the Galaxy M30 won over the two phones by scoring 6552, while the Galaxy A30 and Galaxy M20 scored 4266 and 5653 respectively. Surprisingly, the Galaxy M20 beat the other two in some more benchmark tests like Geekbench Single-Core. Heat, I felt, was one element not very well managed on the Galaxy M30. The front face of the phone heated up every now and then, especially when a background activity like new app installs was happening. This made placing the earpiece against the ear quite difficult., , Performance on the review unit of the Galaxy M30 can best be termed decent. It wasn’t underwhelming in that the phone was able to keep up while performing everyday tasks like calling, texting, browsing, online video playback, and some light gaming without any major struggle. That said, its performance wasn’t particularly laudable either. Though minor, there were noticeable stutters and lags in the animation while switching between apps and tabs inside Chrome. Luckily, they never felt like they were bringing the overall speed of the phone down by a great margin. For example, pulling the notification bar down while playing a game or video would often result in noticeable stutters in the animation. That aside, there was no major flaw in overall performance., Gaming too was decent on the Galaxy M30 review unit. According to our metrics analysis tool; Gamebench, Asphalt 9 ran at a median frame rate of 28 frames per second when the measurement was taken for about thirty minutes. PUBG Mobile, on the other hand, ran on Medium graphics settings at a median frame rate of 24 frames per second. Both scores are on the lower side even for mid-range models in the Rs 14,000+ price range. I faced no major lag while gaming on the Galaxy M30 save for a few occasional jerks while loading and during action sequences in the game. In other words, the Galaxy M30 is best bought by those who don’t play games heavily or care about gaming quality too much., , Finally, here’s a department in which the Galaxy M30 differs from the Galaxy A30. While the Galaxy A30 gets a dual camera setup with its primary sensor being a larger 16-megapixel unit, the Galaxy M30 gets a triple camera setup. The rear panel has three cameras stacked vertically. The first and primary camera is a 13-megapixel sensor with an aperture of f/1.9, equipped with phase-detection autofocus. The second camera is a 5-megapixel 12-millimetre “ultra-wide angle” sensor with an aperture of f/2.2, offering a 123-degree field of view. The third camera is a 5-megapixel depth sensor with an aperture of f/2.2. The front face has a single selfie shooter, which is a 16-megapixel sensor with an aperture of f/2.0. The selfie camera is used across the Galaxy M30 and Galaxy A30., , Before I go any further, I recommend that you check out this piece that’s dedicated to the Galaxy M30’s camera prowess, it was composed by my colleague Swapnil last month. You can find full-res camera samples taken by him here on our Flickr gallery. In my own experience with the Galaxy M30 review unit, I thought photos taken on the Galaxy M30 review unit’s primary camera displayed the right amount of colour and sharpness. Photos taken through the ultra-wide angle sensor display a considerable amount of barrel distortion, which becomes more apparent if the composition isn’t right. Photos taken through the Live Focus mode appear appropriately blurred when the camera is trained on faces but the system falters when the camera is focussed on other subjects like a small idol of Buddha., Photos taken indoors appear grainy and darker than usual. It’s the same case with videos shot indoors but the camera is quick to focus when the scene changes, which is good for panned takes. Selfies come out bright and colourful even when shot indoors but could do with more detail. Most faces appear just a bit distorted when zoomed in. Though the camera software is eager to add “Beauty” effects to any selfie, the option can be turned off completely. On the bright side, the default camera app is mostly quick to reach while taking photos and after taking photos. There’s no noticeable lag between daytime shots and while opening the gallery for previews., One area where the Samsung Galaxy M30 understandably suffers is in its lowlight capabilities. The primary camera, when shooting in low light, suffers from significant loss in detail because of aggressive noise reduction. There is also a minor but noticeable lag between focussing, tapping the shutter button, and the shot being taken. Suffice it to say you will not be taking in action shots during night time. Similarly, the ultra-wide angle camera in low light, without AF, suffers from poor exposure and plenty of noise. You’re better off avoiding using the ultra-wide angle camera in low light. In summary then, the camera on the Galaxy M30 has its share of weaknesses but comes out all right in the end for everyday photos, especially in the daytime. Just don’t count on it for lowlight shots., , Click on the images above to view their full-res version in Flickr, , Primary camera, , Ultra-wide angle camera, , Primary camera, Normal mode, , Primary camera, Live Focus mode, , Regular selfie, , While the Galaxy A30 gets Samsung’s latest software in the form of Samsung One UI layered on top of Android 9 Pie, the Galaxy M30 settles for Samsung’s older Experience 9.5 UI spread on top of Android 8.1 Oreo. The software makes for an overall pleasant experience while using the Galaxy M30. Users who like setting different wallpapers and themes will enjoy the many free and paid options Samsung’s UI has to offer. Users will also get the option of using Samsung’s gesture-based navigation, which, sadly, is not the same as the pill-type navigation offered on stock Android Pie. The icons and menus still resemble the old TouchWiz UI Samsung used to use on its older smartphones, which is good news for Samsung loyalists. All that said, Samsung should really work fast to roll out Android 9 Pie so it can keep up with the competition., While the Galaxy A30 stands proudly with its 4,000mAh battery, the Galaxy M30 quietly wields a larger 5,000mAh lithium polymer unit, which seems to make a world of difference to the phone’s battery life. On our standard battery benchmark test, the Galaxy M30 review unit scored an impressive 666 minutes (11 hours, 6 minutes). In comparison, the Galaxy A30 scored 512 minutes in the same test, and Galaxy M20, an even more impressive 834 minutes., , In everyday usage scenarios, the Galaxy M30 lasted well over one and a half days with about 20 percent charge to spare. During these test scenarios, I left the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on and set the screen brightness to over 60 percent. When I played a YouTube video in Full HD resolution for about forty minutes, the battery dropped only by 3 percent. When I played PUBG Mobile for about thirty minutes, the battery dropped only by 4 percent. On the whole, I got the impression that the phone was lasting over a day and a half on a single charge. Charging took close to two full hours, which is understandable, given the massive capacity of the battery inside., The Samsung Galaxy M30 seems to tick most of the right boxes for a mid-range Android smartphone at Rs 14,990. Two apparent areas of weakness, however, are performance and software. While performance on the Exynos 7904-powered Galaxy M30 isn’t bad, it isn’t particularly impressive either. The feeling that you’re using a mid-range smartphone with sub-par specs does seep in when you’re gaming or browsing heavily. Software too isn’t as updated as what’s available on the Galaxy A30, a phone that was launched around the same time as the Galaxy M30., , If, however, you’re buying a smartphone for light-to-moderate usage, involving messaging, calling, and some photography, the Galaxy M30 steps up to the plate. In addition, the Galaxy M30 has respectable build and a clean look all around. So, whether you’re taking the Samsung Galaxy M30 to college, work, or around the neighbourhood, you’re likely to catch a second glance from passers-by., Written with inputs on Camera from Swapnil Mathur"
2461,,samsung-galaxy-m30-review-177425,0,0,2019-05-22,177425,Vignesh Giridharan,Samsung Galaxy M30 Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-m30-review-177425.html,"The Samsung Galaxy M30 is similar to its cousin, the Galaxy A30, in a lot of ways, including performance and camera quality. Where it feels like a step up is exterior design and battery life. Where it feels like a step down is software. It’s still a pretty good buy for Rs 14,990., , In the last two or so months, Samsung has announced a whole bunch of smartphones in India, including refreshed models in the Galaxy S, Galaxy A, and Galaxy M series. While the Galaxy S series continues to represent the Korean electronics company’s flagship range, the Galaxy A and Galaxy M series are two very similar ranges that represent Samsung’s mid-range smartphone models. Understanding the difference between the updated Galaxy A and Galaxy M series can be tricky, considering the similarities in specs and model names, but the latter seems to be spelling “mid-range” more clearly these days, what with the Galaxy A80 now advancing towards pop-up and swiveling cameras., The Samsung Galaxy M30 was announced in India on February 27 with the #IM3XPOWERED hashtag pasted all over social media, indicating the presence of a triple camera setup on the back. The phone was launched in two variants: 4GB RAM + 64GB storage for Rs 14,990 and 6GB RAM + 128GB storage for Rs 17,990. Colour options included were Gradation Blue and Gradation Black. We got the 4GB RAM + 64GB storage variant on our testbed in Gradation BLue, and we got cracking with its tests. Read on to learn how it performed., Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, Samsung Galaxy M20 64GB Review, Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Review, Samsung Galaxy A30 Review, , The build of the Galaxy M30 is quite similar to that of its A-series cousin, the Galaxy A30. It has a smooth rounded finish on all four corners and a back panel that’s made completely of plastic. To add a touch of class to it, Samsung has thrown in a two-tone gradient finish on the back panel; the blue on the back of the phone fades from light to dark gradually along the length of the phone. The result is a phone that both looks and feels good in the hand. Even without any case or cover on, the Galaxy M30 feels grippy in the hands. What’s more, the back panel remains mostly free of smudges and fingerprint marks. That said, you wouldn’t want to hold this phone right after feasting on an oily samosa., , While the top side of the Galaxy M30 houses just the secondary microphone, the left side is home to the SIM and microSD card slot. The bottom side gets a 3.5mm audio jack, a USB Type-C port for charging and data transfer, and a single-grille loudspeaker. That leaves the right side of the phone to house the power button and volume rocker, which are well placed and comfortable to press. Those who aren’t a fan of Samsung’s proprietary virtual assistant Bixby will be happy to note that there’s no dedicated Bixby key on the Galaxy M30’s body. The back panel is home to a vertically aligned triple camera setup, a single LED flash, and a fingerprint scanner, which, in my opinion, is placed way too high up for easy reach. In summary, the Galaxy M30 is built and designed quite well for its price., , , Like the Galaxy A30, the Galaxy M30 has a 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with an aspect ratio of 19.5:9 and a resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels. Like some of the other models in the Galaxy A and Galaxy M series, the Galaxy M30 is blessed with Samsung’s “Infinity-U” display, which means that it gets a high screen-to-body ratio of over 90 percent and a tiny U-shaped notch at the top to accommodate the single selfie camera. Pixel count on the display is approximately 400 pixels per inch, which is definitely healthy by today’s standards., , The colours on Galaxy M30’s display appear full and rich. In addition, the software allows the colours to be set to a cooler or warmer temperature. The screen is dim enough to be used in bed and bright enough to be used indoors. The minimum brightness is 3 LUX and the maximum brightness is 560 LUX. In comparison, the Galaxy A30 and Galaxy M20 have a maximum screen brightness of 616 LUX and 537 LUX respectively. Content on the Galaxy M30’s display isn’t viewable under direct sunlight but that’s forgiable, given that sunlight legibility is quite hard to achieve anyway. In summary, the Galaxy M30’s display is surely up to the mark, considering its price in the market. I just wish the software had an option to lower the screen resolution by just one notch (sorry for the unintended pun); that would have helped save more battery., , Sound from the Galaxy M30’s single down-firing loudspeaker is moderately loud. The driver inside is good enough for ringtones and alarm tones but not fit for high-quality music. At maximum volume, you can observe signs of tearing and distortion in high frequencies. Bass, on the other hand, is tinny, and therefore produces poor “thump” effect for songs like Starboy by The Weeknd. If you’re a fan of music on the go it’s worth getting a portable Bluetooth speaker along with the phone. On the other hand, the earpiece is loud and clear enough for calls even in noisy environments like a crowded canteen., , As you may have guessed by now, the Galaxy M30 shares its Exynos 7904 chipset with the Galaxy A30. The Exynos chipset, built on a 14-nanometre process, has an octa-core processor. There are two high-performance Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 1.8GHz and six high-efficiency Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.6GHz. The GPU is a Mali-G71 MP2, the same as that on the Galaxy A30. All this is combined with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM, depending on the variant you pick. The storage on board can be expanded to a maximum of up to 512GB using a microSD card, which gets a dedicated slot along with the two SIM cards., The Galaxy M30 review unit fared more or less as well as the Galaxy A30 and Galaxy M20 on our CPU and GPU benchmark tests. On AnTuTu 7.0, the Galaxy M30 trumped the Galaxy A30 by 13665 points but lost to the Galaxy M20 by 187 points. On PCMark Storage, the Galaxy M30 won over the two phones by scoring 6552, while the Galaxy A30 and Galaxy M20 scored 4266 and 5653 respectively. Surprisingly, the Galaxy M20 beat the other two in some more benchmark tests like Geekbench Single-Core. Heat, I felt, was one element not very well managed on the Galaxy M30.

It's a no brainer for Note lovers and makes a lot of sense for others as well., , Update: The score for this phone was 84 at launch. This has been changed to 82 after new flagships were launched. Read on to find out more., Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, Samsung Galaxy M30 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10 Review, Samsung Galaxy A30 Review, Smartphone firms don’t surprise me anymore, and very few actually impress. When Samsung took the stage this year, it impressed us all, albeit playing safe after last year’s shenanigans. The Galaxy Note has always been Samsung’s prized product. It’s a category Samsung created, and the Galaxy Note 8 is poised to spoil Apple’s tri-phone party. For the most part, this is an S8 Plus with the S-Pen, but then again, in many ways it isn’t. I switched from the Galaxy S8 Plus to the Note 8 for this review, so I have a pretty good idea of how this phone differs. We’ll begin with the obvious., Camera: A Samsung camera out and out, but better..., It’s no surprise that Samsung chose the telephoto+wide angle offering for the Note 8, but OIS on both rear cameras does make this enticing. On paper, that allows the Note 8 better low light photos even on its tele lens, something other cameras do lack. If you’ve been a Samsung user so far, you would know that the company has made considerable progress with its low light algorithms, and all this put together makes the Galaxy Note 8 an exciting proposition indeed. Let’s discuss this part by part., , Shooting regular photos, The Galaxy Note 8 has all the signature elements of a Samsung camera. It shoots bright low light photos, vibrant colours and produces soft details often. But, the Note 8 is markedly different too, since it does all this with greater detail and better colour definition. Dynamic range is excellent, but the Note 8 excels at reproducing the slight bluishness in the night sky or the difference between the light blue sky and soft white clouds during the day. In a way, the Note 8 proves that the second sensor is what Samsung’s cameras were missing so far. Noise levels are reduced and though the algorithms bring some softness in details, these are the best photos a Samsung phone has ever taken for me., , , 100% crop of photo above, , Shot by Galaxy Note 8 in indoor incandescent lighting, , 100% crop of the photo above, , Shot by Galaxy Note 8 in indoor incandescent lighting, , Shot by Galaxy Note 8 on a sunny day, I have to enlarge photos to give you my analysis of the camera, and see them on a pre-calibrated display, but many of the Note 8’s faults, like the pleasant but noticeable oversaturation of colours and soft details, will never affect a regular user who clicks and shares photos, all from his phone., Low Light photos, Everything I wrote above is true for low light shooting as well, but I had to add a separate section to talk about the live focus mode., It’s easy to expect dual-OIS to make low light photos better, but the tele lens is simply not suited for this. I have taken some disastrous low light bokehs of my friends, which I’m not allowed to share in public. Samsung calls its bokeh mode “live focus” and like many others, it disables this mode if light conditions aren’t suitable. That means you won’t be able to shoot bokehs on a dimly lit street. To be fair, no smartphone camera can really do this at the moment any way., , Night shot taken using Galaxy Note 8, That aside, you get excellent low light photos when shooting with the primary camera. Frames are brighter than every other phone on the market, colours are vibrant, but details are slightly soft. The Note 8 is particularly good at dealing with lights in the frame, a striking difference against other Samsung phones. While most cameras create a sort of blur over such lights, including the Galaxy S8 Plus, the Note 8 is better at defining the warm glow of a halogen bulb. It’s not that no flagship phone can do this, but it’s an improvement for Samsung nevertheless., Background blurs/bokeh, Everyone and their mother is busy telling you that their smartphone can take DSLR quality photos when they can’t. What phones like the Note 8 can do though is create an above average blur (by phone standards) that makes for a great profile photo on Facebook. On the Galaxy Note 8, this is achieved using the “Live Focus” mode that takes these depth enabled images. The second camera comes into play, and while OIS should compensate for hand shakes to some extent, I found that my hand really doesn’t shake a lot when taking bokehs. You, of course, may not agree with the same., , , While background blur is created with the help of software as well, the Galaxy Note 8 does well in producing a pleasant looking blur. The subject stands out, but I’d warn you against expecting the same level of details as the primary camera. In fact, images are even softer with this one and it's almost useless in low light. The vast difference between the primary and secondary camera is indeed disappointing here., Zoom, I’ve never really been a big fan of 2x zoom on smartphones, even if it is done through optics. Sure, optical zoom gives you better photos than digital zoom, but that just covers the theory bit of it. In practical terms, I’ve never really been able to find instances where 2x optical zoom gets me as close to a subject as I want. Have you?, On the Galaxy Note 8, optical zooming is seamless. Samsung has the 1x-2x button on the viewfinder, and the cameras interchange without any lags or hitches. It’s also a decently detailed photo, though as my colleague pointed out in an optical zoom comparison recently, it’s not the optimum quality this phone is capable of. Like the iPhone, the Galaxy Note 8 allows you to run up to 10x zoom, but anything beyond 2x is done digitally and it’s not really useful., , Original, , 2x zoom, , 100% crop of 2x zoomed photo, All this is true for any optically zooming camera on a smartphone, so the Note 8 must not be singled out. Samsung does use better sensors, so the phone can give you better photos than lower end devices (Duh!). If you do need 2x optical zoom for something, this won’t disappoint., Dependability, The primary concern for smartphone cameras is dependability. Can I take shot after shot with this phone without worrying about a blurry photo, or misjudged scenes? Well, that’s one area the Note 8 has covered impressively. If you know a little bit about how to frame photos, the Galaxy Note 8 can take some truly beautiful photos. If you’re just the point-and-shoot type, the Note 8 will still not disappoint. The only drawback is that in the few instances where the phone takes a second longer to focus/judge the scene, you’ll press the shutter button and the camera won’t respond the first time. It doesn’t happen very often, and is usually limited to low light conditions only., Another aspect of dependability is in shooting videos. This will matter to a select few, but the Note 8 uses optical image stabilisation, which I suspect is mixed with some EIS as well, to produce smooth flowing video. The example below is shot using the Galaxy Note 8 from a moving car and you can not tell that my ride was bumpier than usual. Video stabilisation on the Note 8 has a striking resemblance to the Pixel from last year., , Video shot using Galaxy Note 8 from a moving car. There were some bumps on the way, but the Note 8 doesn't care, The Note 8 also shoots in Auto HDR mode, unless you turn it off from settings. Samsung has taken a page out of Google’s playbook here, and it all works splendidly., How is the Galaxy Note 8’s camera then?, The Galaxy Note 8 has what you could call a complete camera. It shoots great photos consistently, and produces impressive bokehs as far as smartphones are concerned. Had it not been for softer details, the Note 8 would have been the perfect camera for a smartphone. It’s a stunner in its own right. The only real flaw in this camera is that the difference in quality between the primary and secondary cameras is a tad too great in my opinion. If you use the primary camera often, the occassional secondary camera shot would disappoint you., To understand the difference between the Note 8's camera against the S8 Plus, read this comparison., , Click the album for full sized image samples clicked by the Galaxy Note 8, S-Pen: Still accurate, but more enthusiast friendly..., The other differentiating feature of the Note 8 is its S-Pen. Samsung’s little stylus isn’t meant for everyone, but Note lovers will discuss at length why the S-Pen is such an important tool. Samsung says the S-Pen has improved this time and can support more points of pressure, but that’s barely discernible. More importantly, the company has added some features to the S-Pen this time, that can be considered more enthusiast friendly, than business-like., , Handwritten GIFs, Apple lets you send handwritten or drawn photos on the iMessage, and Samsung now has “Live Messages”. Samsung’s version is more useful, simply because it creates GIFs, that can be shared on any platform supporting GIFs. The S-Pen also makes it much simpler to draw things, or write note, which was just too cumbersome to do with my finger, on the iPhone., For live message, you pull out the S-Pen and click the Live Message option from the pen’s menu on screen. A small box takes up half the screen after this and you can start drawing/writing. You can also change the type, width and colour of the pen you’re typing with., GIFs from videos, Adding to the list of things that are simpler with the S-Pen is making videos with it. Samsung’s “Smart Select” option now provides an “Animation” feature, that lets you cut out GIFs from any video playing on the phone. You draw a frame using the S-Pen, then hit record on the part you want as a GIF. It takes some getting used to, but not really enough to complain. Here’s a particularly creepy GIF I created of my colleague Shrey Pacheco., , via GIPHY, Translate, Most people depend on Google for their translation requirements, but Samsung is betting S-Pen users will find that easier with the pen. After tapping the translate button on the pen’s menu, you can simply hover the pen over a word on the screen to translate it into a desired language. It works with almost all text that is on the phone’s screen, although I did have trouble translating text in photos sometimes., I can see how this feature can be useful, but I would have wished an easier shortcut. For example, Samsung could allow you to double press the button on the S-Pen to turn this feature on., Taking notes, Taking notes works like it always did. You pull out the S-Pen and choose the Notes option. But, on the Note 8, you can also start writing on the Always On display and Samsung allows over 100 pages of notes on this. You can also write down a grocery list on the Always On display, or something else you want to be reminded of, which can then be pinned to the Always On display. So, every time you look at your phone, the reminder will be right there in front of you. The only hitch here is that the pinned reminder becomes an icon on the Always On display as you start getting other notifications, which somewhat breaks the functionality., Build and Design: As premium as it gets..., My colleague dropped the Note 8 by mistake, from about three feet and it didn’t break..., While that sounds impressive for a phone made completely out of glass, I’d still warn you against rough use. Samsung has used tough glass on the Note 8 and you’ll probably get away with the simpler drops, or if you can break the fall somehow. But drop it directly on concrete or asphalt and the Note 8 will break. The Note 8 needs care, because glass can break. That’s true for any phone with a glass body today, including the upcoming iPhones. So, while I can’t say the Note 8 is a sturdy smartphone, I will say that it’s impeccably designed and well built. It has a metallic frame, which Samsung polished to make the entire phone feel like it’s made of glass. The frame has the same finish as the Jet Black iPhone last year., , , The company struck gold with its curved display a few years ago, and has been milking it since. The Note 8 has a sharper and more block-like design than the S8+, which feels more ergonomic to me. I met at least two people who disagreed though. The Note 8 is also substantially heavy, which is probably why it feels more ergonomic than the S8. I think Samsung chose to make this device more rectangular so as to accent the screen. The Note 8’s display is only 0.1 inch larger than the S8 Plus, but it somehow feels a lot bigger., I personally prefer the black variant of the Note 8, but you may not feel the same. The Note 8’s rear camera module remains black both colours, and I prefer the all black model to the black on gold combination of the other variant., , For those unaware of the Note series, the S-Pen is on the bottom. You push it inwards and it pops out, ready for use. The speaker grille, USB Type-C port, headphone jack and a noise cancellation mic are at the bottom. The power button rests on the right, where your thumb usually would be (if you’re right handed) and the Bixby button unfortunately is placed parallel to this on the left. You will obviously need to shift your grip with this device, and though this is the most ergonomic a Note device has ever been, ergonomics aren’t part of the buyer or the seller’s concerns here., From a design purview, I’m truly fond of the Note 8. It’s literally the most premium feeling phone you can buy right now, and I personally do think it’s the most beautiful phone too. Yes, surpassing even the Galaxy S8. Samsung couldn't change the fingerprint sensor placement for the Note, but having used the S8 Plus for a while, I've realised that I could actually get used to it., Display: Bright, curved, warm and great…, Samsung’s Infinity Display makes an appearance on the Note 8, and it’s as great as it was on the Galaxy S8. You get extremely deep black thanks to the OLED panel, while overall contrast levels are great too. Colour tones are warmer than natural, but I know many who would prefer this to an iPhone’s more true to source tones. It basically comes down to what you personally like, but if we’re talking overall quality, the Note 8’s display is indeed the best there is today, alongside the Galaxy S8 series., The Note 8’s maximum resolution is 2960x1440 pixels, but it’s set to 1080p by default, perhaps to save battery life. If you want the absolute best it can do, push the resolution up from the Display Settings, but I would actually recommend keeping it at FHD, because it makes little difference in viewing content (unless you do watch 2K/HDR content) and saves battery life., Performance: Fast, smooth, but Android…, Note: Since new phones have been launched since the Note 8, we have revised its performance scores retrospectively. As a result, the device's overall score has also been reduced from 84 to 82., For a while now, the problem with Samsung’s flagship phones has been that they run Android software. The company has tweaked Touchwiz to make it smoother, lighter and better looking, but as a rule of thumb, Android phones do slow down with time. I was using the Galaxy S8 Plus for four months before switching to the Note 8, and that phone is noticeably slower than it was out of the box., When you first use the Note 8, it’s amongst the fastest phones on the market today. It has oodles of RAM and one of the fastest processors there is today. It breaks benchmark scores of course, but in the past week, I’ve seen no lags or stutters on it. Rather, they weren’t any greater than what you would already expect from an Android phone. It shifts from one WiFi network to the other in a blink, and once you’ve paired with a Bluetooth device, you won’t even notice subsequent connections. I usually connect my PC to my home’s Bluetooth speaker. If the Note 8’s Bluetooth is turned on, it connects to the speaker almost immediately after I turn my PC off, or shut Bluetooth., , As far as Android phones go, this is certainly amongst the fastest there is. Games run without lags or stutters, and signal connectivity is top notch., Battery: Not a workhorse, but meets industry standards…, Continuing to play it safe, Samsung put a slightly smaller battery on the Note 8, than that on the Galaxy S8 Plus. The phone carries a 3300 mAh battery this time, and while its battery life isn’t exemplary, it beat my expectations. I had to charge the Note 8 once every night. With 100% battery at 9am, the phone would creep into the battery red zone at around 8-8.30pm every day. That’s just over a work day’s worth of battery life., To give you a better perspective, my day included about twenty minutes of streaming video to you guys on Facebook Live, at least an hour playing Sim City Build It, 15 odd phone calls, and far too many messages on WhatsApp, along with regular browsing on social media., The PC Mark Work 2.0 battery test lasts for 9 hours and 58 minutes., Bottomline: The best Note ever…, The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is not just the best Note device ever, it is also amongst the best smartphone to buy today. It’s a no brainer for Note lovers and it’s also a no brainer for flagship buyers. Unlike the US, the Note 8’s pricing in India is pretty much within the flagship standards, which means when price is no bar, this is indeed the smartphone to buy., How it compares, Many, including myself, would question the wisdom in buying a phone worth nearly 70k, but the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is perhaps the only phone that’s ever made me want to own it. It’s premium to the core and the S-Pen is available only on this device. The fact, though is that the OnePlus 5 (review) still does feel faster than this phone, though the camera on this phone is indeed much better, especially in low light conditions., ..."

The new Exynos 9820chipset manages to finally rack up impressive benchmark numbers which are corroborated with daily usage and the 4100mAh battery does not disappoint. The camera, though working as advertised, does need some improvement. All things said and done, the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus is a smartphone worthy of your money., , Last year, the Samsung Galaxy S9 and the S9+ came with very incremental upgrades in comparison to the previous year. However, there had been a lot of excitement around the Galaxy S10, and Samsung did not disappoint. The new Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus comes with several new features and numerous improvements over its predecessor. India will receive the Exynos 9820 powered Galaxy smartphones and it appears that Samsung may have finally solved the scheduler issue in their SoC which prevented the processor from reaching its maximum potential. We’ve had the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus in our test labs for some time now, going through our new testing process. Here’s every aspect of the Galaxy S10 Plus analysed in detail, so you can decide whether its worth your money or not., Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, Samsung Galaxy M20 64GB Review, Samsung Galaxy A30 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus

Battery Capacity: 4100mAh, When Samsung launched the Galaxy S7 Edge, the company had come up with a design that would come to define its flagship series. Now, the curved displays are the default in Samsung’s flagship phones. The glass back and front is held firmly together by a solid aluminium frame. Samsung shared the Prism White variant of the phone with us, and it has to be said that the finish is definitely unique. The white on the back shifts in hue from white, to pink, to blue, depending on how light bounces off it. Being white in colour, the highly fingerprint-friendly nature of the phone is well hidden. You may not be so lucky with the Prism Black and Prism Blue colours., The phone’s design is for the most part identical to the previous year’s S9+, save for some obvious changes. While the display is bigger, what stood out particularly was that the power button was placed way too high on the left side of the frame. While I have relatively small hands, everyone who I had try the phone said the exact same thing; the power button is placed inconveniently high. However, it isn’t something you can’t get used to. I just hold the phone a little higher than normal, which in any case gives a better grip of the phone., , The polished aluminium frame holds the glass on the front and back firmly in place, The phone, being made of Gorilla Glass 6 on the front and Gorilla Glass 5 on the back is extremely slippery and required to be placed in its case for safety. In our testing, the phone started to slip at an incline of just 5 degrees on a polished plywood surface, which does not bode well. In real life scenario, this means that even the slightest incline paired with the vibrations of an incoming call could cause the phone to slip off the shelf and fall., A few other notable features of the new Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus happen to be the more Note-inspired curvature. The Galaxy S9 and S9+ had more pronounced curves on the top and bottom corners, but the S10 Plus’s curvature resembles that of the Note 9. The crisper corners are nice as it gives the phone a stronger presence. The other immediately noticeable feature of the S10 Plus’s design is how light it is. Weighing in at 175 grams for the non-ceramic version, the phone is 14 grams lighter than its predecessor, despite a denser battery and a bigger form-factor., , The sharper curves are reminiscent of the Samsung Galaxy Note 9, In our books, the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus is a gorgeous smartphone. Some might even say that it is the best-looking smartphone that has come out so far. However, the slippery nature of the device warrants that you put it in a case, which does take away from its slim and light form-factor., The most notable feature about the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus’s display is that it supports HDR10+. An upgrade to the HDR10 standard, HDR10+ now encodes per-frame metadata into a video, and in order to be compliant with the standard, Samsung had to develop an OLED panel that could dynamically adjust based on the frame’s metadata. This by itself is incredibly impressive. The 6.4-inch display sports a resolution of 3040 X 1440, pegging the panel’s pixel density at roughly 522ppi. We have come to expect high pixel densities from Samsung on their flagship, so this is nothing new., , The sub-pixel arrangement of the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus, Interestingly, unlike last year, the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus only offers two display modes; Vivid and Natural. Choosing Vivid enabled the phone’s wide colour gamut colour space, ideal for those who like saturated colours and would be viewing content in HDR from Netflix. The natural colour profile switches the display over to the sRGB colour space, ideal for those who want to view photos and non-HDR videos in their true colour space. Essentially, if you’re a content creator, the Natural setting is the right choice for you and if you’re a voracious watcher of online videos, then you may be better off using the Vivid setting for the display., We tested the maximum and minimum display brightness for the display and found some very interesting results. The display has a maximum brightness of 650 nits when the brightness is turned up manually. However, if the auto-brightness setting is enabled, the system can push the display to over 1000 nits of brightness. The display also achieves this level of brightness when playing HDR10 content, but since it is not for a sustained period of time, it is hard to notice., , Still one of the best smartphone displays, Thanks to such a high level of brightness, the Samsung Galaxy S10 absolutely dominates the bright outdoors. Whether it's watching videos or just conducting day-to-day business on the phone, the sunlight would not drown out the visibility of the display, and reflections wouldn’t get in the way of the content. Even in bed, you can turn the brightness down all the way to a decent 2 nits so that using the phone won’t hurt in pitch dark., The display itself is undisputedly class-leading and for the first time, Samsung is shipping their smartphone with a screen protector pre-applied. This is very helpful as it prevents scratches from appearing on this otherwise gorgeous display. Unfortunately, we ended up taking the screen protector off our review unit and found the surface of the display to be extremely slippery to the touch. We don’t think the screen would retain this quality after prolonged use, but we will update you on the state of the device in 6 months., Even before the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus hits store shelves, Samsung has pushed out an OTA update that brings improved performance to the in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor. When the phone landed in our test labs, there was no trouble in registering the fingerprints. Since then, the phone has had a negligible rate of failure, that is, instances where it did not recognize my fingerprint. After having used the Huawei Mate 20 Pro for the better part of the last few months, the position of the fingerprint scanner on the Samsung Galaxy S10 has taken some getting used to., The active area for the scanner is just above where the home button “should be.” Through constant usable, you should be able to get used to its placement rather easily. Typically, when you lift the phone to unlock it, the display will light up, highlighting where to place the finger for the fingerprint sensor to work, making the process of unlocking the phone easier., In terms of speed, the fingerprint sensor does work fast, although it is nowhere close to the speed of the traditional capacitive fingerprint sensors. When compared to the optical-based in-display fingerprint sensors, we have not yet been able to come to a conclusive decision on who’s faster due to mixed results. Regardless of that, the scanner is fast enough for the phone to unlock seamlessly. You won’t find yourself having to wait for the phone to unlock., , The ultra-sonic in-display fingerprint sensor works reliably, although its a hair slow, The advantage of having an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor is that this type of method is immune to the presence of dirt and water. We were successfully able to unlock the phone 27 out of 30 times using a heavy dirt laden finger (dry dust) and recorded 24 out of 30 successful unlocks with wet fingers. , Overall, we are very happy with the effectiveness of the in-display fingerprint sensor on the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus. Sure it's not the fastest out there, but it is still fast enough to not come across as slow. Additionally, the speed of the sensor is something that Samsung can improve over time with software updates like they already have done pre-launch. If you do end up buying the phone, we recommend running the update before getting involved with the fingerprint sensor., The Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus is powered by the Exynos 9820 processor built on an 8nm process. The SoC comes with 8 cores in three clusters. The four small/efficiency Cortex A55 cores are clocked at 1950MHz, the dual middle Cortex A75 cores are clocked at 2314MHz while the remaining 2 performance Exynos M4 cores are clocked at 2730Mhz. The tri-cluster design is fast becoming popular as it allows the chip to remain power efficient by activating specific cores based on the task at hand. The Exynos 9820 is paired with 8GB of LPDDR4x RAM, enough for your work and play needs. The Exynos chips have always been beaten upon for being slower than their Snapdragon counterpart, but we were very curious to see just where the new Exynos chip fell in terms of performance metric. So we put it through our set of CPU and GPU synthetic benchmarks., We began our testing by running GeekBench, where the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus scored 4501 and 10225 on Single and Multi-core respectively. In comparison, the OnePlus 6T with its 10GB of RAM scored 2302 and 8691 on the same benchmark while the Note 9 scored 3758 and 9062. On AntuTu, the S10 Plus scores a commendable 328402, the highest score we have seen on the benchmark in our lab so far., , The Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus scores highly on the AnTuTu test, , Geekbench Single and Multi-Core results for Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus, Moving over to the GPU part of the test, we weren’t all that convinced that the Mali G76 could claw its way to the top, given that Qualcomm’s Adreno GPUs have always been leaps ahead. Again, we were surprised to find that the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus scored either the highest or in the top 3 for GPU benchmarks. On GFX Bench’s Car Chase and Manhattan benchmarks, the phone scored an impressive 2358 and 2356 respectively. On 3DMark’s Slingshot, the S10 Plus clocks a score of 4584, once again the highest score we have seen on the benchmark., While all the benchmarks were running, we verified that the performance was not being artificially boosted by recording real-time CPU and GPU speeds and validating those numbers against the load on each part of the chip. We also corroborated the benchmark results in our real-world usage tests., , 3D Mark Slightshot results, , Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus gets a good score on GFXBench, Our test began with multiple gaming sessions on PUBG Mobile and Asphalt 9. We used Gamebench to once again record real-time metrics for frame rates to see how the phone was behaving. With both PUBG Mobile and Asphalt 9 set to their highest respective graphical settings and got to playing. We recorded metrics for matches and races so as to get a fair metric. We noted a median frame rate of 28fps for Asphalt 9 while on PUBG Mobile, we got a median frame rate of 30fps with a 90 percent stability rate. While playing PUBG itself was a smooth experience, there were points during Asphalt 9 where we definitely saw some tearing. Unfortunately, we noted this behaviour multiple times, at specific points in the race. We played both the games with the phone set to performance mode. We’re hoping that subsequent updates to the game and OS would improve the performance a little more., When it comes to day-to-day use, however, the Samsung Galaxy S10 is an absolute treat. Over the course of the last 10 days, I have written a few news stories on the Samsung Galaxy S10 while commuting. Writing stories often also includes putting together images. I normally shoot product shots on my Sony A7 MarkII, so I can quickly transfer files from the camera to the phone over wi-fi. These 24-megapixel full resolution images are then edited in either Lightroom mobile or Snapseed. In fact, half the product shots in this review were edited in Lightroom Mobile, but you wouldn’t be able to tell which. During the edit, there were no hiccups or delays in preview renders, which is pretty much what you would expect from a flagship device., We were left very impressed by the new SoC and associated components, which allows the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus to score highly on our performance benchmarks. Sure, the Snapdragon 855 may be faster, but we’re at the point where flagships have gotten fast enough for the differences to be barely noticeable. In our testing, we found no reason to be left unhappy with the S10 Plus’s performance, which is rather rare for us, especially this early in the year., Last year, Samsung used the camera as a key differentiator between the S9 and the S9 Plus. This year, that difference does not exist as both the phones come with a triple camera. For those buying either of the phone, you get a 16MP ultra-wide camera (12mm) with an aperture of f/2.2. This camera doesn’t come with AF or OIS. The primary camera has 12-megapixel resolution and a dual aperture mechanism going between f/1.5 and f/2.4. This camera sports Samsung’s dual pixel AF and OIS, along with offering a 26mm field of view. The third camera is sporting a telephoto lens with an aperture of f/2.4 along with OIS and PDAF. We’ve seen this kind of a configuration from both Huawei and LG in their flagships, so Samsung does have stiff competition. We are going to break the camera review into smaller pieces because there is a lot to talk about here. There’s a lot going on with the S10’s camera, so we have done a separate, in-depth analysis of the camera which we recommend you read., The primary camera by itself performs as admirably as you’d expect from a Samsung flagship smartphone. This is the first time Samsung’s put an ultra-wide-angle lens on a flagship camera, and we noted that it has significant amounts of barrel distortion which will be noticeable in your shots. The primary and telephoto cameras, on the other hand, do not exhibit any noticeable distortion., , Low light shot from Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus's primary camera, , HDR algorithms balance shadows and highlights very well, , The 12mm ultra-wide angle lens has significant distortion, but creative framing can use it to your benefit, , Low light shot from the 12mm ultra-wide angle camera, , The 52mm telephoto lens produces photos with impressive details, In terms of image quality, day time results from all three cameras are impressive in terms of sharpness, colour reproduction and contrast. The overall dynamic range is also good, given that the camera is applying HDR on its own. The AF system is fast and works reliably for both the regular and telephoto lenses. The ultra-wide 12mm lens does not have capabilities and neither does it have (or need) OIS.,  The low light performance of the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus is once again impressive, at least in the way that you are more likely than not to get a properly exposed shot. What you do lose, however, its accurate colour reproduction, detail and sharpness. The main camera still manages to produce usable photos, but the ultra-wide and telephoto lenses are not of much help, due to their small apertures. The Super Night shot which is supposed to improve low light photography is buried at the very bottom of the scene optimiser’s priority list and hardly ever kicks in. Even in the rare occasion that it does, it does so only after 5-8 seconds which is way too long for any kind of AI to be taking., Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus has a camera that manages to work as well as its flagships from last year, but the new features introduced (which are many) need serious improvements. Thankfully, most of this can be done through software updates, so hopefully, S10 users will get to enjoy improved imaging experience., The Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus features two cameras in the front, a primary 10-megapixel shooter with an aperture of f/1.9 and dual pixel AF. The secondary 8-megapixel camera is there purely to aid in depth information and does not actually produce any images. When taking selfies, you can choose a closer view of your face, with the resulting image being around 5-6 megapixels. Switch to the full perspective and you get the whole 10-megapixel resolution, and enough room to fit in at least 3 more people with you in the frame., , Indoor selfies turn out okay, , Daytime selfies do turn out great, , Low light selfies can definitely be improved, In terms of the image quality, the S10 Plus produces some of the best selfies out there, with adequate sharpness and enough detail retention. Day time shots regardless of whether they’re taken in the shade or against the sun did come out very impressive and we’re pretty happy with the output. Low light photos, on the other hand, are not impressive at all. You’d be better off using the flash., The OS pre-loaded on the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus is Samsung’s newest OneUI based on Android 9 Pie. OneUI is a testament of just how far Samsung has come from its iOS copycat OS days. The operating system is elegant, clean and easy to navigate. It does offer enough customization options for both the look and feel and the performance aspects of your device. OneUI offers the traditional on-screen navigation buttons, but also offers a gesture-based system which is pretty unique. Instead of going with the iOS-like gestures, Samsung’s implementation involves swiping up only to get around the OS. Samsung still refuses to let users apply third-party themes or icon packs, and instead, requires users to use its own theme engine., OneUI is built on Samsung’s Knox secure platform, which means besides Samsung Pay, you also get the Secure Folder which allows you to move files and apps within a secure, encrypted and completely isolated part of the storage. What this means is that content within Secure Folder is not visible to file explorers and apps can only be accessed by unlocking the folder., The Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus is packed with a 4100mah battery capable of fast wireless charging. The new trick here is that the S10 Plus also packs reverse wireless charging, which you can use to charge another smartphone, smartwatch or even the Galaxy Buds., On the Geekbench battery life test, the phone lasted about 6 hours and 20 minutes. During our gaming tests, we noticed that the battery dropped by 6-8 percent for 15 minutes of playtime on PUBG Mobile and Asphalt 9 each. Streaming Altered Carbon in HDR via the Netflix app cost us 18 percent battery life per episode. In day to day usage, the phone lasted a day and a half, being pulled off the charger at 8 am and being needed to be charged back up around noon the next day., Speaking of charging, we noted that the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus can go from 2 percent battery to 100 percent in 94 minutes. An hour and a half to charge up a 4100mAh battery is impressive. Reverse charging also works as advertised, but is slow if you're trying to charge another smartphone. This feature best works for charging small accessories like the Galaxy Buds or even a smartwatch that doesn't use a proprietary connector or charging method., The Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus is quite a banger of a phone and a great sign of things to come, from Samsung and hopefully other manufacturers in the months to come. It has one of the best displays we’ve tested and with the HDR10+ certification, you’re looking at a device that’s great for content consumption. The phone packs enough power under the hood to be able to handle anything you throw at it. As an imaging device, the phone continues to be as impressive as last year’s offerings, but some of the new features introduced this year need to be improved, especially the Super Night shot feature, which needs to be its own mode and not a scene optimizer setting. If you’re considering buying the Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus, it would definitely not be a bad one."
2477,,samsung-galaxy-s10e-review-179033,0,0,2019-05-22,179033,Subhrojit Mallick,Samsung Galaxy S10e Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s10e-review-179033.html,"The Samsung Galaxy S10E is proof that phones don’t have to come in a giant footprint to be deemed powerful. Sometimes, the smallest packages pack the largest punch and the Galaxy S10E does just that. It’s performance and the camera quality is more or less similar to the Galaxy S10 and the Galaxy S10+. While you’re unlikely to miss the larger display or the extra cameras, the disappointingly short battery life is sure to rain on the S10E’s parade. Just remember to keep a charger handy all the time. For an otherwise fantastic package, the battery life is a big let down and is the only reason why I’d recommend the Galaxy S10 over the S10E. We will be keeping a close eye on the software updates pushed out by Samsung over the next few months and will report in case the battery life improves., , When we think of flagship devices in 2019, form factors that come to our mind range from giant phablets to bezel-less, edge-to-edge displays to even displays that fold. And while Samsung did launch flagships that are large, that can fold and have more cameras than you can keep count, the Korean giant also came out with the Galaxy S10E, a compact flagship to cater to a segment of users that have mostly been ignored in India. Compact flagships used to be Sony’s forte with the Xperia Compact series that did launch in India till a few years ago. There’s also the Google Pixel 3, supposedly aimed at users looking for a smaller phone without compromising on the performance. But no device out there presently can match the size and compact form factor of the Galaxy S10E. Yes, we checked with all other compact flagships kept side-by-side. But form-factor aside, the Samsung Galaxy S10E doesn’t seem to skimp on the features that define the Galaxy S10 flagship lineup, save for a few missing features here and there. And for a price of Rs 55,900, it certainly doesn’t demand a kidney. But with the iPhone XR, Google Pixel 3 and even the OnePlus 6T vying for the attention of a price-conscious smartphone enthusiast, can the Samsung Galaxy S10E offer enough benefits for your money? Let’s find out., Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Samsung Galaxy M30 Review, Samsung Galaxy M20 64GB Review, Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Review, Samsung Galaxy A30 Review, , The Samsung Galaxy S10E can be credited for reviving the seemingly dead compact flagship segment. Only the Google Pixel catered to the segment so far and the S10E becomes a good alternative to go for if you are a stickler for small phones. In fact, the Galaxy S10E is even smaller than the Google Pixel 3, and in front of it, the iPhone XR looks like a giant phablet., It’s all glass, though, on the front and the back, as has been the case with Galaxy flagships since the Galaxy S6. However, while every year Samsung uses the latest generation of Corning Gorilla Glass, the Galaxy S10E has Gorilla Glass 5 on both the front and the back. Samsung does bundle a perforated case in the box which saved the phone from receiving any damage when it fell from pocket height., , The prism white  reflects new colours every time you pick it up., The Galaxy S10E is offered in two colour variants in India. The Prism White and Prism Black variants are identical to the Galaxy S10’s design. The black variant is glossy but doesn’t reflect colours when held against the light. The Prism White variant, however, reflects new colours every time you pick it up. It looks perfectly premium, and even though this is the ‘budget’ flagship, there has been no compromise in the build and design of the phone.  The only place where Samsung seems to have saved costs is in the fingerprint sensor. The larger Galaxy S10 and the S10+ have an ultrasonic fingerprint sensor embedded under the display, but the S10E comes with a capacitive fingerprint sensor embedded into the power button on the right side. While it becomes muscle memory after a few days of use, I often found the fingerprint sensor and especially the gestures associated with the sensor interfering with my activities like gaming. However, when compared against the in-screen fingerprint sensor on the Galaxy S10, it’s much faster and offers instant access to the lock-screen when the screen is off., Despite being made of glass, the Galaxy S10E doesn’t feel slippery at all. The compact form-factor also allows for a solid grip in the hand and it’s easy to use the phone one-handed. Only the bottom bezel is quite distinct and while the screen doesn’t curve around the edges (another cost-saving feature) like in the Galaxy S10, the borders around the screen are minimal enough to not come in the way. Speaking of buttons and ports, the S10E has only the power button on the right while the volume rockers and the Bixby button are on the left. The power key with the embedded fingerprints takes up a relatively larger area and is flush with the body which makes it difficult to locate for the first few times. Nothing that you won’t get used to, though. Samsung also finally gave in to demand and made the Bixby button customisable to launch other apps., , Galaxy S10e's size in comparison with the Galaxy S10, Especially noticeable is the new punch-hole camera. The 10MP front camera is embedded under the glass. Credit has to be given to Samsung for staying away from the notch that seem to be there on almost any and every smartphone last year. The company leapfrogged ahead to drilling the camera inside the display. The new design is much less intrusive. You can in-fact use
interesting wallpapers to disguise the camera. There’s an entire sub-reddit for that even., The design and build of the Samsung Galaxy S10E is every bit premium. Don’t let the lower price let you think otherwise., , There might not be many takers for a compact phone these days, but Samsung gives you enough reason to not look elsewhere. While most manufacturers tend to compromise on the display of their budget offerings, Samsung went all out and put a HDR10+ certified display on the Galaxy S10E. Compared to last year’s ‘budget iPhone’, it’s miles ahead. The Galaxy S10E’s 5.8-inch display has FullHD+ resolution with support for next-gen HDR standard. It’s the same display that’s on the larger Galaxy S10 and the S10+ with only the resolution dialed down from 2K to HD., , The Galaxy S10e's front camera is drilled into the display, When watching content on Netflix, you will often spot the HDR tag on shows and movies and you can enjoy those in stunning clarity provided the internet speed is adequate. There’s visible difference between the colours and the details on say the OnePlus 6T and the Samsung Galaxy S10E. The iPhone XR despite coming with only a 720p display also did quite well in our display tests, but can’t hold a candle to the perfection Samsung brings to the table when it comes to the display., , Maximum Brightness (In lux), , Minimum Brightness (In lux), We registered peak brightness of 604 lux in our tests while the phone went down to a minimum 4 lux when the brightness was the least. The brightness also gets a boost if auto-brightness is turned on and the proximity sensor senses you are outside in the sun. But then no matter how bright it is outside, the Galaxy S10E’s display never seemed to wash out. It’s perfectly legible under direct sunlight., , Display settings on the Galaxy S10e, Samsung also offers the ability to tweak the colour temperature, and even set the white balance of each individual colours. By default the Vivid mode is selected that does boost the colour contrasts and saturation. We recommend switching to Natural, where the vivid colours are engaged only when you’re watching HDR content., , Despite being the smallest of the lot, the compact Samsung Galaxy S10E is just as powerful as its bigger siblings. Under the hood is the same hardware that powers the Galaxy S10 and the Galaxy S10+ — The Exynos 9820. It’s Samsung’s latest flagship chipset manufactured on a 8nm process with a tri-cluster CPU setup. There are two high-performance custom cores based on ARM Cortex-A76 clocked at 2.73GHz, two medium-performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.31GHz and four high-efficiency ARM Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.95GHz. The tri-cluster arrangement apparently allows for a better load distribution between the cores. For instance, the custom cores are engaged only when there’s heavy load like gaming, or shooting at 4K, while the medium cores are engaged when you’re taking photos, or watching a YouTube video. The four efficiency are used the most when you’re just generally using the device. Whether it’s the latest ARM cores, or the tri-cluster setup, the Galaxy S10E runs butter smooth no matter what you throw at it., The Exynos 9820 is paired with 6GB LPDDR4X RAM and 128GB UFS 2.1 storage. It’s weird how Samsung refrained from using the next generation memory and storage despite pioneering LPDDR5 RAM and UFS 3.0 storage in the mobile space. Nevertheless, between the three variants, there are slight differences in benchmark scores, but if you compare it against the likes of the OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition and LG G7+ ThinQ, both of which are priced in the same range, the S10E comes out on top. However, when pitted against the iPhone XR, Apple’s budget iPhone launched last year, we see some interesting differences. Here’s what the benchmarks revealed —, CPU, , , On AnTuTu, the Samsung Galaxy S10E outscored all other Android flagships launched last year, but fell just shy of beating the iPhone XR, while on Geekbench Single Core and multi-core tests, it was bested only by the iPhone XR., GPU, , However, when we tested the graphics rendering using 3DMark Slingshot test, the Galaxy S10E managed to beat the iPhone XR, but the LG V40 ThinQ and the OnePlus 6T both performed much better in those tests. The Galaxy S10E also got modest scores for AI performance and VR rendering. We also checked for artificial boosting which some OEMs tend to do when a benchmark app is detected. There was no such issue with the Galaxy S10E., In day-to-day usage, the Galaxy S10E worked without a hitch. I used the phone as my daily driver and except for the shoddy battery life (more on that, later), I faced no issues whatsoever. I used the phones to write my articles, take photos and edit them on the go using Snapseed and Lightroom Mobile and everything happened quite seamlessly. Considering its compact nature, it took a little time to get used to typing (I was coming from the OnePlus 6T), but once I did, there was no problem in belting out long sentences. The tactile feedback is especially good. There seems to be absolutely no difference between the three Galaxy S10 models as far as performance is considered., , Gamebench scores of PUBG Mobile, Gaming on the Galaxy S10E, on the other hand, isn’t the best experience. Firstly, the display is just too small to have a wide screen-space to move your fingers around, and secondly, the Mali-G76 MP12 isn’t the best GPU for mobile games. We played multiple sessions of PUBG Mobile and Asphalt 9 and recorded the frame rates in real time using GameBench. PUBG Mobile gave a frame rate of 37 FPS with 91 percent stability while Asphalt 9 delivered 29 FPS at 86 percent stability. The frame rates are higher than what the Galaxy S10+ and the Galaxy S10 produced while playing the same games at the same settings, but that’s likely because the S10 and the S10+ come with 2K displays, and more pixels mean more time to render, leading to a lower frame rate. Between the three Galaxy S10 devices, the S10E is the best phone for gaming, but overall, the OnePlus 6T still tops the chart in terms of frame rates and stability., , , The Samsung Galaxy S10E runs on Samsung’s new OneUI based on Android 9 Pie. It’s a big departure from the Samsung Experience interface that the company offered in the Galaxy S9 and the Note 9 last year. It’s much more seamless and intuitive, but more than that, it’s much more aesthetically pleasing than the older interface. OneUI brings gesture navigation which only involves swiping up from different parts of the screen to navigate. Furthermore, Samsung finally allows users to remap the Bixby button to do just about anything. I used it as a quick access to the camera. However, you won’t be able to install third-party themes and icon packs. Instead, you have to rely on the Galaxy Store to download them, and most of the good ones are not free to use., , Bixby itself is now much more usable. I particularly liked Bixby routines which activated preset settings at a particular time or location,  like turning the Wi-Fi off when I left work. These can easily be done by a third party app like IFTTT, but having it baked in makes it much easier. The Galaxy S10E also comes with Digital Wellbeing which was announced alongside Android 9 by Google which helps monitor your smartphone usage, and if required, even take steps to curb it down., There are a lot more new features that would require a separate article to talk about. But overall, this is an excellent evolution of the old Samsung interface which was one of the primary reasons most people held back from buying a Samsung flagship. OneUI makes using the Galaxy S10E so much better., , , No triple cameras on this one, but you won't really miss the telephoto lens, While there isn’t any compromise in the performance or the display, what makes the Galaxy S10E the least expensive sibling of the Galaxy S10 trio is the camera on the back. Instead of three on the back and two on the front, the Galaxy S10E has two cameras on the back and one on the front. The dual camera stack includes a primary 12MP sensor with variable aperture of f/1.5 and f/2.4 along with a 26mm wide lens, and a 16MP ultra-wide angle sensor with f/2.2 aperture and fixed focus and 123-degree wide field of view. The primary sensor comes with OIS but the wide-angle sensor doesn’t have it, and frankly, doesn’t require it. What the S10E lacks is the telephoto lens that’s there on the S10+ offering 2X optical zoom., To be honest, you won’t be missing out on much. It’s difficult to tell photos taken from the three variants apart from each other, so it’s safe to say, the cameras are tuned and optimised similarly. The sensor offers excellent dynamic range at daylight, while low-light shots come out fairly bright and usable., While Samsung refrained from getting into a megapixel war that is currently waging with the 48MP camera sensors, the 12MP sensor on the Galaxy S10E manages to take some fine photos, even in tricky lighting. The sensor used on the S10E has a smaller 1/2.55” surface area but has large 1.4um pixel size. If you compare against the 48MP Sony IMX586 sensor, that’s exactly the pixel pitch you get in the binned mode. Essentially, apart from the crazy details the 48MP sensor promises, the S10E’s 12MP sensor is perfectly capable of producing images with good exposure and sharpness., In the sample above, the colours are perfectly reproduced with high precision. Even a bright sky could not darken the subject. Moreover, the sharpness of the phone is quite high. A 100 percent crop (shown below) reveals how well the details are retained., , 1/320 sec. f/2.4, ISO 50, Having said that, in the samples shown above, Samsung’s aggressive sharpening algorithms does make the lines appear a bit too sharp when zoomed in. However, the exposure and the details are almost always perfect when shooting in daylight., , 1/125 sec. f/2.4, ISO 64, Like the Galaxy S9 and the Note 9 that came out last year, the S10E’s primary camera also has the dual-aperture mechanism. It can switch between f/1.5 and f/2.4 automatically with the option to do it manually in the pro-mode. The f/1.5 aperture is used to capture low-light images while the f/2.4 aperture is put to use for all other time of the day. At low-light, shifting between the two aperture does result in different exposures, but I’m yet to find one good reason why anyone would attempt to shoot low-light photos at f/2.4 when most smartphones use f/1.8 to f/1.5 apertures across all situation., Low-light images using the primary camera are much better than what the S9 managed to produce. Earlier, Samsung’s nasty noise-reduction algorithm almost always smudged the details, but this time around, even though there is some level of noise-reduction applied, the result is much sharper with good exposure and contrast. The samples below will tell you the story., , 1/50 sec. f/1.5, ISO 800, , 1/50 sec. f/1.5, ISO 640, A word about the AF system of the Galaxy S10E. The S10E uses the same dual-pixel mechanism to focus on the subject, and this time there are more pixels available to use for auto-focus which greatly improved the auto-focus performance, especially at low-light. The sample below will be a testament to that. I took this photo from inside a speeding auto and the result is quite impressive., , 1/10 sec. f/2.2, ISO 640, The Galaxy S10E is also equally good at taking close-up photos. We wouldn’t call it macro as the minimum focusing distance isn’t all that small. Furthermore, Samsung could have enabled AF in the ultra-wide angle camera to use as a macro lens like the Huawei Mate 20 Pro does, but unfortunately the wide-angle lens has a fixed focus., , 1/50 sec. f/1.5, ISO 400, Between the telephoto and the ultra-wide camera, I’m glad the Galaxy S10E retained the ultra-wide angle camera as part of its dual camera system. It’s a good way to stand out from rivals like the OnePlus 6T and to compete head on against the LG flagships which have been the flagbearer of ultra-wide cameras on phones for years.  In fact, the S10E’s ultra-wide camera does a much better job than the LG V40 ThinQ. There is barrel distortion of objects that are very near to the lens, but it is expected given that this is a 12mm lens., However, the lens lacks autofocus and has the focus set to infinity, limiting your shooting options. This makes it tricky to use the camera first, but after a few tries, it’s not hard to figure out the sweet spot. Samsung’s Shot Suggestion feature does come in handy if, like me, you’re not a professional photographer. The feature intelligently analyses the scene you’re shooting and suggests you how to frame it. In most cases, the photos came out straight and well-composed when using the feature., Using the wide-angle lens to shoot low-light photos isn’t a good idea though. The f/2.2 aperture is too small to take in more light and wide-angle lenses in phones, generally  tend to underexpose frames in low-light., Take a look at a few samples from the ultra-wide camera —,  ,  , , 1/500 sec. f/2.2, ISO 50, , 1/320 sec. f/2.4, ISO 50, , 1/800 sec. f/2.2, ISO 50, The Galaxy S10E may not have a telephoto lens to use a depth sensor, but it still manages to take fine portrait photos with the background blurred. The algorithms are well-optimised to detect the edges of the subject, however, the blurring is not as natural as what the iPhone XS produces. You also have to stand at a particular distance to get the feature working., Having said that, Samsung introduced some new bokeh effects that does make taking portraits fun. There’s a swirl effect and a zoom effect. Both of these features work quite well. There’s also a third option of colour pop which isn’t quite accurate and often colours elements other than the subject., You can also adjust the type and amount of bokeh in your photo after shooting it. Here are some samples —, , Live Focus mode, , Portrait Mode effect, , Portrait Mode effect, , Colour Pop mode, , ..."
2050,,samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-review-54772,0,0,2019-05-22,54772,Prasid Banerjee,Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s8-plus-review-54772.html,"The Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus brings flagship class design and is finally a phone that doesn't look like all others. If that piques your interest, then this is the phone you should buy. It's one of the best smartphones out there today, but an incremental update in everything except design., , Edge displays may not be the most useful thing you’ve ever seen on a smartphone, but they sure look good. And after three years and five such phones, Samsung has finally perfected its curved flagship design. It was close last year, but 2017’s models scream refinement and the Galaxy S8+ is the bigger of the two smartphones. You’ll read about the curves and edges a lot in this review, because unlike most flagships the Samsung Galaxy S8+ is more about design, and not just the hardware side of it. It's Samsung's best work till date and despite last year's debacle, it raises my hopes as to what the Galaxy Note 8 is going to be like now. But, I digress. Here's the Galaxy S8+ review., Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, Samsung Galaxy M30 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Review, Samsung Galaxy A30 Review, Build and Design, A glass body comes with an inevitable flaw, one that Samsung seems fine with. The Galaxy S8+ and Galaxy S8 offer too much to break. Combined with a slippery body, you’re looking at a bumper case, or at least some kind of cover. That may still pass on the compact Galaxy S8, but on the S8+ it makes for a phone that's a tad unweildy. The last thing you want is to break this display. The display on last year's Galaxy S7 Edge would cost users about Rs. 18,000 for replacement, so one can only assume that this one would cross the 20k mark. That's about a third of the device's buying price., , On the other hand, if you are like me and decided to risk it, then you’re in for a treat. Fingerprints will show on the back, but frankly speaking, I really didn’t mind them. My midnight black unit looks great, and it’s comfortable to hold. Well, at least more comfortable than other 6-inch devices. Truth be told, while the Univisium display does make the Galaxy S8+ narrower than other 6-inch smartphones, it’s not exactly ergonomic., Samsung has indeed proved what it can do with a curved body and an 18.5:9 display. The slight curves near the rear edges also make the phone easier to grip. That is, as much as is possible with its screen. Placed side-by-side, the Galaxy S8+ is more or less as big as an iPhone 7 Plus (review). That’s no mean feat, but on a personal note, the iPhone 7 Plus isn't the best example for design any way., The buttons, A big part of the Galaxy S8+’s design finesse is in how the buttons are placed on the device. In order to make the phone feel like it was all screen, Samsung finally used on-screen buttons on its phones. The home, recents and back buttons work just like on any other phone, but there’s an embedded home button below the display as well., , So, when watching content in full screen, you can simply push down on the point where the home button should be and you’ll jump back to the home screen. When not in full screen mode, you can swipe up to bring the buttons back in view. The embedded button works in a similar manner to Apple's Force Touch, but I did find it easier to get used to., Moving to the hardware buttons, you’ll find the power on/off button on the right, while the volume rocker and Bixby button lie on the left. While all of these are easy to reach on the Galaxy S8, on the S8+ it’s the Bixby button that’ll fall below your finger at all times (unless you have big hands), making you wish there was a way to remap it to the power on/off function., Slim bezels or no bezels?, There's no real ""bezel-less"" display, but one can't blame Samsung for calling this one of those. No matter what colour you buy, the front of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is always going to be black, and for good reason. The bezels are so slim and well hidden that you'll pretty much never spot them. It’s worth noting that Samsung isn’t the first to achieve such a design, but it comes with extra “oomph” due to the curved edges., , Another impact of these slim bezels is that you get a lot of screen real estate, even in the smaller device. They allow the on-screen buttons to feel non-intrusive., That fingerprint sensor and other biometrics, I have to be honest here. Ever since any of us saw the Galaxy S8 via leaks, the fingerprint sensor placement seemed destined to frustrate, especially on the bigger device. The Galaxy S8+ is just too tall and the fingerprint sensor is too difficult to reach. Combined with the slippery back, it makes for a precarious way to unlock the phone. , When you do reach it, the fingerprint sensor is quick to unlock the Galaxy S8+, but it’s just too difficult to get used to. Given the excellent design language and choices, this is a gaping hole in the phone that’s supposed to make up for the Galaxy Note 7’s misstep., , I tried using the Iris Scanner and Face Unlock features instead, but they’re neither dependable nor seamless enough to be used regularly. You’ll need to aim the camera correctly, which takes some getting used to. Also, the face unlock feature won’t work in low light, while the iris scanner also trips up a tad too often. It took me 7 tries just to register my iris on the scanner. What's worth noting is that Samsung's Iris Scanner is much easier to work with than Windows Hello on Windows-based phones., Display, 700 words down and we’re just scratching the surface with Samsung's design work. Moving to the next phase — the display. If you haven’t done the math already, QHD resolution on a 6.2-inch panel amounts to 529 ppi pixel density. Translation: the display is as sharp as it gets., More importantly, Samsung has toned down colour saturation this time. To be clear, you still get pleasantly oversaturated tones, but the yellowish hue is not as apparent as before. Black levels are great, which also helps in hiding the bezels. Samsung allows users to toggle the level of red, green and blue colours on the screen, which is something enthusiasts would appreciate., , I saw a reddish tint appear on the display from minor angles, but the same didn’t happen on the Galaxy S8. Given that this is a reported issue that Samsung has responded to, I’m assuming it’s one specific to my unit. I also noticed a rainbow effect on the Edge part of the S8+’s display and this too wasn’t found on the S8., Univisium aspect ratio, Univisium may finally turn out to be the future, but it's just a fancy spec at the moment. It allows the display to be taller instead of wide, which is the main reason for this phone’s compact form factor. However, content doesn’t yet conform to it. So, at least for the time being you’ll have to deal with pillarboxing. On the Galaxy S8+, Amazon Prime streams video in a rectangular format, with black bars on the Edge part and on the two sides. On the Galaxy S8, this seems limited to the sides only., UI, UI design is a big part of designing a smartphone and the Samsung Experience (that’s what Touchwiz is called now) is the best the company has done so far. For the sake of familiarity and simplicity, I’m just going to call it Touchwiz in this review., , UI design is another part of the finesse I talked about earlier. I’m still not particularly fond of Samsung’s always on display, but much like other things on this phone, it looks good. I wish there was more functionality to it, but this will have to work for now. I'm also not completely sure that this is a light UI, but it's lighter than most Samsung UIs I've used before., Importantly, Samsung has changed Touchwiz’s colour schemes and icon designs this time. Icons have rounded corners and look sharp, and they're colourful to complement the phone's display. To be fair, the company’s been heading this way since last year, but once again it saved the best for the last.,   , If you’ve used a Samsung phone recently, you would have seen the grouped Settings menu as well. There’s a Search button within settings that makes it simpler to find what you’re looking for. That makes customising the phone fast and extremely easy., As I mentioned before, Samsung’s Edge features are pretty gimmicky and not really useful. However, the company has made a solid change this time. Its game tools icon appears (when needed) alongside the on-screen keys, making it less intrusive. Similarly, notification icons on top appear just in front of the curve (third photo above), while heads up notifications appear seamlessly and without any stutters. If you have texts on WhatsApp etc, you can reply directly from the Notifications drop-down too, and Samsung has its own tasteful take on how this should happen (see picture below). I wish the reply box was a tad bigger, but this still works., , Next, you get the suite of Samsung and Microsoft apps, neither of which can be removed. There are also a bunch of Google apps pre-installed, including Google Duo, but these can be removed from the phone. There’s also an app called Samsung Connect for smart home controls, while My Galaxy brings coupons and some other services to Samsung’s customers., Most importantly, you’ll find an “expand” option on apps within the Recents menu. This allows you to fit almost every app to the new 18.5:9 display, and use them in full screen mode. I did have problems using some apps like this, which is probably why Samsung has kept it as an optional feature., Bixby, Samsung's AI assistant has been a much talked about feature on these phones, but in India, it's less an AI assistant and more a replacement for Flipboard right now. It takes over the left most screen from Flipboard and can be called using the hardware button too.,  , First up, Bixby is slow to launch when using the hardware button, which put me off from using it. More importantly, its hands are tied, especially in India. Samsung currently has a tie-up with Pinterest, but that's pretty much all Bixby does. If you use it within the camera app, it'll find photos similar to the ones you pick. If there's text in your photos, Bixby can read that and pick the text out. Shopping features are missing from the country right now, but Samsung should bring them soon. Most importantly, Bixby doesn't have voice support right now, although Samsung has promised to add it soon., In India, Bixby is pretty much a clone of the Google Now screen on most other smartphones. It shows you information like Alarms, social feeds and News. Like other AI assistants, Bixby will also need time to learn and improve, which means much like the Google Assistant or Apple's Siri, it's a gimmick Indian users will not really find very useful, at least for now. It's there though, as a sign of things to come in future., Performance, At this point, you know effectively everything there is to know about the Galaxy S8+. But a review wouldn’t be complete without a word about its performance., On this front though, improvement is only incremental at the moment. To be fair, that’s true for all OEMs and not Samsung alone. The company’s Exynos 8895 SoC (used on the India model) is faster than last year’s phones, but only incrementally so., 
AnTuTu Benchmark, 
Geekbench 4 Single Core, 
Geekbench 4 Multi Core, 
GFXBench Car Chase, The Mongoose cores take care of heavy tasks this time. There are four of them clocked at 2.5GHz, while the Cortex A53 cores handle the simpler tasks, clocked at 1.7GHz. As we saw on the Galaxy C9 Pro (review), the Mongoose cores kick in whenever there’s a UI transition happening, keeping things fast and snappy. However, I did see some UI lags on the Galaxy S8 and S8+. They’re nowhere close to hampering regular or heavy usage, but they’re a little unsightly when they happen. You’ll find these most often when using Facebook’s Instant Articles., The GPU also does well. Samsung chose a Mali-G71 MP20 manages to clock up 60 frames per second in games that allow it. I found steady 60fps frame rates on games like WWE Champions, while Marvel’s Contest of Champions and Asphalt 8 both ran at a steady 30fps too. These games are limited to 30 fps by the developer, so as to provide top performance on most phones., Heat levels are also decently managed by the Galaxy S8+. Gaming drove temperatures up to 39 degrees on the body over about half an hour, while 4K video recording makes it hotter. That’s with the room temperature regulated to 24 degrees, so you’ll be heating the phone up faster if you’re out in the 40 plus degree heat we have nowadays. However, none of that is abnormal or worrisome., Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S8+ brings stellar performance, which is what you expect from such a device. However, one wonders how much this will drop over a year or so of usage. Unfortunately, that's one of the inescapable perils of Android smartphones today., Audio Quality, The Galaxy S8+ is delivers richer audio than most smartphones, but it's no match against phones like the LG V20 or Sony Xperia XZ. That said, the pair of AKG headphones you get in box would be appreciated by many. The headphones are well beyond what we have come to expect from in-box headphones. They're not quite audiophile grade, but you'll still get clearer and richer audio through them, than you usually do., Camera, We all expected Samsung to pull out all the stops on the Galaxy S8 and S8+, but the company isn’t embracing the dual-camera yet. Samsung probably wanted to reserve that feature for the Note 8, which would be a very Apple-like thing to do, but hey, this camera doesn’t bring up many complaints either., Samsung used a Sony IMX333 sensor with f/1.7 aperture this time, and the same dual-pixel technology we saw last time. It’s pretty much the same camera, except Samsung says it has improved the algorithms behind the camera this time. You see this in terms of focusing speeds, which seem faster than before. However, the rest remains the same., , These two sample images have been resized for the web. The gallery below them has full sized camera samples, , , The camera produces sharp, bright and pleasantly oversaturated colours. The S8+’s camera is more dependable (than the Galaxy S7 Edge) when shooting on the go, thanks to faster focus. Although, I daresay Samsung needs to improve this aspect a little more. Images can also be a bit softer than is ideal., Overall, the Galaxy S8+ stands to become one of the best cameras this year, but we’ll have to wait for the next Pixel phones and iPhones to determine whether this is indeed the best. , Battery, The larger size allowed Samsung to include a 3500 mAh battery on this one. This isn’t huge by today’s standards, but it achieves reasonable battery life. The PC Mark battery test returns 11 hours and 31 minutes. In the real world, this translates to about 12-14 hours of regular usage. I tested this with half an hour of gaming, some video streaming and regular activities like social networking and about 10 phone calls., To make it simpler, I streamed three continuous hours of HD video on the phone, dropping the battery from just over 80% to nearly 0. When it does discharge, the Galaxy S8+ charges really fast, so half an hour’s worth of charge will get you very close to 50%, enough to last a full 24 hours then., What’s interesting is that Samsung claims this battery will retain 95% of its battery life after two years. I’ll have to get back to you on this one, but if Samsung can live up to this claim, it’s going to be a big improvement in smartphone batteries., Bottomline, So, is the Galaxy S8+ the phone to buy this year? It’s too early to say right now. But for the time being, Samsung has done a wonderful job designing this smartphone, while other improvements remain incremental. It’s sad that OEMs can’t innovate on smartphones anymore, which is why one has to give Samsung credit for at least redoing the design. On other fronts, the Galaxy S8+ is a flagship as flagships go. It dazzles on the outside, but beauty is only skin deep."

The Galaxy S8+ and Galaxy S8 offer too much to break. Combined with a slippery body, you’re looking at a bumper case, or at least some kind of cover. That may still pass on the compact Galaxy S8, but on the S8+ it makes for a phone that's a tad unweildy. The last thing you want is to break this display. The display on last year's Galaxy S7 Edge would cost users about Rs. 18,000 for replacement, so one can only assume that this one would cross the 20k mark. That's about a third of the device's buying price., , On the other hand, if you are like me and decided to risk it, then you’re in for a treat. Fingerprints will show on the back, but frankly speaking, I really didn’t mind them. My midnight black unit looks great, and it’s comfortable to hold. Well, at least more comfortable than other 6-inch devices. Truth be told, while the Univisium display does make the Galaxy S8+ narrower than other 6-inch smartphones, it’s not exactly ergonomic., Samsung has indeed proved what it can do with a curved body and an 18.5:9 display. The slight curves near the rear edges also make the phone easier to grip. That is, as much as is possible with its screen. Placed side-by-side, the Galaxy S8+ is more or less as big as an iPhone 7 Plus (review). That’s no mean feat, but on a personal note, the iPhone 7 Plus isn't the best example for design any way., The buttons, A big part of the Galaxy S8+’s design finesse is in how the buttons are placed on the device. In order to make the phone feel like it was all screen, Samsung finally used on-screen buttons on its phones. The home, recents and back buttons work just like on any other phone, but there’s an embedded home button below the display as well., , So, when watching content in full screen, you can simply push down on the point where the home button should be and you’ll jump back to the home screen. When not in full screen mode, you can swipe up to bring the buttons back in view. The embedded button works in a similar manner to Apple's Force Touch, but I did find it easier to get used to., Moving to the hardware buttons, you’ll find the power on/off button on the right, while the volume rocker and Bixby button lie on the left. While all of these are easy to reach on the Galaxy S8, on the S8+ it’s the Bixby button that’ll fall below your finger at all times (unless you have big hands), making you wish there was a way to remap it to the power on/off function., Slim bezels or no bezels?, There's no real ""bezel-less"" display, but one can't blame Samsung for calling this one of those. No matter what colour you buy, the front of the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is always going to be black, and for good reason. The bezels are so slim and well hidden that you'll pretty much never spot them. It’s worth noting that Samsung isn’t the first to achieve such a design, but it comes with extra “oomph” due to the curved edges., , Another impact of these slim bezels is that you get a lot of screen real estate, even in the smaller device. They allow the on-screen buttons to feel non-intrusive., That fingerprint sensor and other biometrics, I have to be honest here. Ever since any of us saw the Galaxy S8 via leaks, the fingerprint sensor placement seemed destined to frustrate, especially on the bigger device. The Galaxy S8+ is just too tall and the fingerprint sensor is too difficult to reach. Combined with the slippery back, it makes for a precarious way to unlock the phone. , When you do reach it, the fingerprint sensor is quick to unlock the Galaxy S8+, but it’s just too difficult to get used to. Given the excellent design language and choices, this is a gaping hole in the phone that’s supposed to make up for the Galaxy Note 7’s misstep., , I tried using the Iris Scanner and Face Unlock features instead, but they’re neither dependable nor seamless enough to be used regularly. You’ll need to aim the camera correctly, which takes some getting used to. Also, the face unlock feature won’t work in low light, while the iris scanner also trips up a tad too often. It took me 7 tries just to register my iris on the scanner. What's worth noting is that Samsung's Iris Scanner is much easier to work with than Windows Hello on Windows-based phones., Display, 700 words down and we’re just scratching the surface with Samsung's design work. Moving to the next phase — the display. If you haven’t done the math already, QHD resolution on a 6.2-inch panel amounts to 529 ppi pixel density. Translation: the display is as sharp as it gets., More importantly, Samsung has toned down colour saturation this time. To be clear, you still get pleasantly oversaturated tones, but the yellowish hue is not as apparent as before. Black levels are great, which also helps in hiding the bezels. Samsung allows users to toggle the level of red, green and blue colours on the screen, which is something enthusiasts would appreciate., , I saw a reddish tint appear on the display from minor angles, but the same didn’t happen on the Galaxy S8. Given that this is a reported issue that Samsung has responded to, I’m assuming it’s one specific to my unit. I also noticed a rainbow effect on the Edge part of the S8+’s display and this too wasn’t found on the S8., Univisium aspect ratio, Univisium may finally turn out to be the future, but it's just a fancy spec at the moment. It allows the display to be taller instead of wide, which is the main reason for this phone’s compact form factor. However, content doesn’t yet conform to it. So, at least for the time being you’ll have to deal with pillarboxing. On the Galaxy S8+, Amazon Prime streams video in a rectangular format, with black bars on the Edge part and on the two sides. On the Galaxy S8, this seems limited to the sides only., UI, UI design is a big part of designing a smartphone and the Samsung Experience (that’s what Touchwiz is called now) is the best the company has done so far. For the sake of familiarity and simplicity, I’m just going to call it Touchwiz in this review., , UI design is another part of the finesse I talked about earlier. I’m still not particularly fond of Samsung’s always on display, but much like other things on this phone, it looks good. I wish there was more functionality to it, but this will have to work for now. I'm also not completely sure that this is a light UI, but it's lighter than most Samsung UIs I've used before., Importantly, Samsung has changed Touchwiz’s colour schemes and icon designs this time. Icons have rounded corners and look sharp, and they're colourful to complement the phone's display. To be fair, the company’s been heading this way since last year, but once again it saved the best for the last.,   , If you’ve used a Samsung phone recently, you would have seen the grouped Settings menu as well. There’s a Search button within settings that makes it simpler to find what you’re looking for. That makes customising the phone fast and extremely easy., As I mentioned before, Samsung’s Edge features are pretty gimmicky and not really useful. However, the company has made a solid change this time. Its game tools icon appears (when needed) alongside the on-screen keys, making it less intrusive. Similarly, notification icons on top appear just in front of the curve (third photo above), while heads up notifications appear seamlessly and without any stutters. If you have texts on WhatsApp etc, you can reply directly from the Notifications drop-down too, and Samsung has its own tasteful take on how this should happen (see picture below). I wish the reply box was a tad bigger, but this still works., , Next, you get the suite of Samsung and Microsoft apps, neither of which can be removed. There are also a bunch of Google apps pre-installed, including Google Duo, but these can be removed from the phone. There’s also an app called Samsung Connect for smart home controls, while My Galaxy brings coupons and some other services to Samsung’s customers., Most importantly, you’ll find an “expand” option on apps within the Recents menu. This allows you to fit almost every app to the new 18.5:9 display, and use them in full screen mode. I did have problems using some apps like this, which is probably why Samsung has kept it as an optional feature., Bixby, Samsung's AI assistant has been a much talked about feature on these phones, but in India, it's less an AI assistant and more a replacement for Flipboard right now. It takes over the left most screen from Flipboard and can be called using the hardware button too.,  , First up, Bixby is slow to launch when using the hardware button, which put me off from using it. More importantly, its hands are tied, especially in India. Samsung currently has a tie-up with Pinterest, but that's pretty much all Bixby does. If you use it within the camera app, it'll find photos similar to the ones you pick. If there's text in your photos, Bixby can read that and pick the text out. Shopping features are missing from the country right now, but Samsung should bring them soon. Most importantly, Bixby doesn't have voice support right now, although Samsung has promised to add it soon., In India, Bixby is pretty much a clone of the Google Now screen on most other smartphones. It shows you information like Alarms, social feeds and News. Like other AI assistants, Bixby will also need time to learn and improve, which means much like the Google Assistant or Apple's Siri, it's a gimmick Indian users will not really find very useful, at least for now. It's there though, as a sign of things to come in future., Performance, At this point, you know effectively everything there is to know about the Galaxy S8+. But a review wouldn’t be complete without a word about its performance., On this front though, improvement is only incremental at the moment. To be fair, that’s true for all OEMs and not Samsung alone. The company’s Exynos 8895 SoC (used on the India model) is faster than last year’s phones, but only incrementally so., 
AnTuTu Benchmark, 
Geekbench 4 Single Core, 
Geekbench 4 Multi Core, 
GFXBench Car Chase, The Mongoose cores take care of heavy tasks this time. There are four of them clocked at 2.5GHz, while the Cortex A53 cores handle the simpler tasks, clocked at 1.7GHz. As we saw on the Galaxy C9 Pro (review), the Mongoose cores kick in whenever there’s a UI transition happening, keeping things fast and snappy. However, I did see some UI lags on the Galaxy S8 and S8+. They’re nowhere close to hampering regular or heavy usage, but they’re a little unsightly when they happen. You’ll find these most often when using Facebook’s Instant Articles., The GPU also does well. Samsung chose a Mali-G71 MP20 manages to clock up 60 frames per second in games that allow it. I found steady 60fps frame rates on games like WWE Champions, while Marvel’s Contest of Champions and Asphalt 8 both ran at a steady 30fps too. These games are limited to 30 fps by the developer, so as to provide top performance on most phones., Heat levels are also decently managed by the Galaxy S8+. Gaming drove temperatures up to 39 degrees on the body over about half an hour, while 4K video recording makes it hotter. That’s with the room temperature regulated to 24 degrees, so you’ll be heating the phone up faster if you’re out in the 40 plus degree heat we have nowadays. However, none of that is abnormal or worrisome., Overall, the Samsung Galaxy S8+ brings stellar performance, which is what you expect from such a device. However, one wonders how much this will drop over a year or so of usage. Unfortunately, that's one of the inescapable perils of Android smartphones today., Audio Quality, The Galaxy S8+ is delivers richer audio than most smartphones, but it's no match against phones like the LG V20 or Sony Xperia XZ. That said, the pair of AKG headphones you get in box would be appreciated by many. The headphones are well beyond what we have come to expect from in-box headphones. They're not quite audiophile grade, but you'll still get clearer and richer audio through them, than you usually do., Camera, We all expected Samsung to pull out all the stops on the Galaxy S8 and S8+, but the company isn’t embracing the dual-camera yet. Samsung probably wanted to reserve that feature for the Note 8, which would be a very Apple-like thing to do, but hey, this camera doesn’t bring up many complaints either., Samsung used a Sony IMX333 sensor with f/1.7 aperture this time, and the same dual-pixel technology we saw last time. It’s pretty much the same camera, except Samsung says it has improved the algorithms behind the camera this time. You see this in terms of focusing speeds, which seem faster than before. However, the rest remains the same., , These two sample images have been resized for the web. The gallery below them has full sized camera samples, , , The camera produces sharp, bright and pleasantly oversaturated colours. The S8+’s camera is more dependable (than the Galaxy S7 Edge) when shooting on the go, thanks to faster focus. Although, I daresay Samsung needs to improve this aspect a little more. Images can also be a bit softer than is ideal., Overall, the Galaxy S8+ stands to become one of the best cameras this year, but we’ll have to wait for the next Pixel phones and iPhones to determine whether this is indeed the best. , Battery, The larger size allowed Samsung to include a 3500 mAh battery on this one. This isn’t huge by today’s standards, but it achieves reasonable battery life. The PC Mark battery test returns 11 hours and 31 minutes. In the real world, this translates to about 12-14 hours of regular usage. I tested this with half an hour of gaming, some video streaming and regular activities like social networking and about 10 phone calls., To make it simpler, I streamed three continuous hours of HD video on the phone, dropping the battery from just over 80% to nearly 0. When it does discharge, the Galaxy S8+ charges really fast, so half an hour’s worth of charge will get you very close to 50%, enough to last a full 24 hours then., What’s interesting is that Samsung claims this battery will retain 95% of its battery life after two years. I’ll have to get back to you on this one, but if Samsung can live up to this claim, it’s going to be a big improvement in smartphone batteries., Bottomline, So, is the Galaxy S8+ the phone to buy this year? It’s too early to say right now. But for the time being, Samsung has done a wonderful job designing this smartphone, while other improvements remain incremental. It’s sad that OEMs can’t innovate on smartphones anymore, which is why one has to give Samsung credit for at least redoing the design. On other fronts, the Galaxy S8+ is a flagship as flagships go. It dazzles on the outside, but beauty is only skin deep."
2238,,samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review-100081,0,0,2019-05-22,100081,Subhrojit Mallick,Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review-100081.html,"The Samsung Galaxy S9+ is the best Android smartphone available right. It's looks stunning especially because of the astoundingly bright display and a design that blends the display to the rest of the body. But more than that, this time, Samsung has taken a new approach to improving the low-light performance of the camera. The rear camera can switch between two apertures. The camera, if one knows how to take good photos, can produce some high-quality shots under poor lighting, especially in a restaurant on indoors, but there are limitations. Samsung's aggressive noise reduction alogrithms keeps the image from being perfect, but it's a commendable effort nonetheless. You can't go wrong with the S9+. It has everything you want from a top-of-the-line flagship phone — Latest high-level hardware, excellent design, high security, and an excellent camera. Having said that, it isn't much different from its predecessor, the Galaxy S8+, which is now cheaper and hence, a more value-for-money proposition. The Galaxy S9+ is evidence that this is an iterative year for Samsung and if you have been holding out on buying a good Android flagship, this is the one to get right now., , As much as Samsung likes to mock Apple, the Cupertino giant’s philosophies are shaping up the Android landscape. No, I’m not talking about the notch. That’s inevitable. I’m referring to the deeper philosophy that Steve Jobs swore by — Don’t fix what ain’t broken. In the fewest of words, that’s how you can describe the new Samsung Galaxy S9+. It can be interpreted as both good and bad. Samsung may not get extra points for introducing a new design with the S9+, but it did give the company enough leeway to work on the finer things, those that don’t always meet the eye, but do end up making a difference., Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, Samsung Galaxy M30 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Review, Samsung Galaxy A30 Review, The Galaxy S9+ is evidence that this is going to be an iterative year for Samsung. As much as it would like to call the Galaxy S9+ a ‘reimagination’ of the smartphone, it’s more of a refinement with some inevitable upgrades., There is of course the latest hardware inside. Depending on where you buy, the S9+ is powered by either Qualcomm’s latest chip or Samsung’s own 10nm chipset. There’s an Rs 8000 wedge between the Galaxy S9 and the larger Galaxy S9+ which is justified by not just a taller screen, but also more memory and a dual camera stack at the back., But is worth the upgrade? More importantly, is it the best Android phone around right now? We find out., Camera: From low light to more light, , If last year’s Galaxy S8 was all about the Infinity Display, this year, the focus is on the camera. So that’s where the review should start, right? The problem that Samsung wanted to address with the Galaxy S9 and the S9+ is low light photography. The company has already set a benchmark for daylight imaging, and now it wants to redefine night photography. It’s an ambitious attempt, no doubt, but with its own shortcomings. We did a detailed camera analysis of the Galaxy S9+ which you can read to get more context., , But before I dive further, allow me to lay down the specs at hand. The Galaxy S9+ sports a 12-megapixel wide angle-telephoto dual-camera stack at the back. It’s actually the same as that on the Galaxy Note 8. But with a small, but significant change. Variable aperture. Samsung borrowed the tech from its own super-expensive flip phone (the $2,000 W2018) that launched in China last year and introduced it to the world. The primary wide-angle 26mm is fitted with a dual aperture module that can shift the aperture from the usual F/2.4 aperture to a wider F/1.5 for low light shots. This is where the magic happens. The dual aperture feature is one of the primary reasons to buy this phone, if not the only one. We did a full-fledged camera analysis of the Galaxy S9+ if you are interested in the nitty-gritties., 
Aperture set to F/2.4 ( Notice the second sensor)


Aperture set to F/1.5 (notice the primary camera hole is wider here), The wider aperture comes into play when there’s less light in the frame. Samsung automatically switches to F/1.5 when brightness falls below a certain point. You can also switch it manually from the Pro mode, along with the shutter speed, ISO, and the likes. Long story short, the F/1.5 aperture allows more light into the sensor and night shots are nicely lit up. It’s especially useful if you are in a dimly lit restaurant. The difference is quite discernible.  But sometimes a bit too much. Most of the times the shots will come out surprisingly good. The details will be quite sharp and the frame will be perfectly lit. But sometimes, it becomes difficult to say whether the photo has been taken in a poorly-lit surrounding or a well-lit one. There’s a lot of light of coming in and the 1/2.55” sensor cannot possibly accommodate it all. That sometimes leads to the shots being overexposed. The wider aperture sometimes makes things too bright, while the F/2.4 aperture makes it too dark. Ideally, there should have been a third aperture setting, somewhere around F/1.7 to F/2.0, to bridge that big a jump, but I might just be asking too much. It’s commendable no doubt what Samsung has managed to achieve here. The Galaxy S9+ can easily light up poorly-lit frames better than anyone there, but the finishing touch is missing., 
Exif: F/2.4, 1/33 sec shutter speed, ISO 200, 
Exif: F/1.5, 1/33 sec shutter speed, ISO 1600, If the hardware takes the future of smartphone low-light photography further, Samsung’s algorithms keep it from breaking new ground. The software behind the scenes aggressively reduce noise from the photo, sometimes smudging the details in order to make things look smooth. There’s the question of that yellow tint on night shots that have been there in Samsung phones since ages. There might be an audience for it, but it’s not my cup of tea. Add to that a layer of saturation and increased contrast, and you get a photo that might look good on the astoundingly bright AMOLED display, but to be honest, it just comes out as artificial. The iPhone X and the Pixel 2 keep things more realistic. The Pixel 2 can preserve the details even better while the iPhone X will take a better composed shot. Samsung has been taking a different approach to low-light photography and with the Galaxy S9+, it has reached new extremes. Both in a good way, and bad, depending on where you stand., 
Exif: F/2.4, 1/6 sec shutter speed, ISO 100, 
Exif: F/1.5, 1/20 sec shutter speed, ISO 250, Nevertheless, this is indeed a big jump over how everyone else has been tackling the low-light barrier, and Samsung comes close to overcoming it., , Yet another highlight of the camera is the ability to record slow motion videos at 960 frames per seconds. That’s a big jump from the 240fps slo-mo the S8+ is capable of. It’s a fun tool to play around with. If you are actively trying to use the feature, you will suddenly be super aware of your surroundings, looking for mundane things to show in slo-mo. It needs a lot of light to work though. The feature is practically useless when there’s poor lighting. It also records the videos at 720p., If you know how to leverage the Pro Mode, you can also use the F/1.5 aperture coupled with a suitable shutter speed to get a natural shallow depth of field in your macro shots in the day. Else, there’s of course the Live Focus mode that was there on the Galaxy Note 8. It works just like the Note 8. Well-detailed bokeh shots in the day and a dark noisy output at night., The Galaxy S9+’s mojo revolves primarily around the camera. And for the most part, it remains a desirable proposition. But with the variable aperture,  this one seems more geared towards professionals who have an idea of photography. In the hands of an amateur, the results might not be so satisfactory, but there’s tremendous potential in the camera, just waiting for you to use., Performance: Fast, but not the fastest,  ,  , As we have noted in a detailed performance analysis of the Galaxy S9+ before, the phone might be the fastest Android phone out there, but it’s definitely not the fastest phone. Our suite of benchmarking apps revealed the Galaxy S9+ falls way short of the iPhone X, which is currently the most powerful phone in the market. Despite the Exynos 9810 chipset which has been manufactured on a 10nm LPE process, powering the Galaxy S9+, it’s no match for the iPhone X’s A11 Bionic chipset., Samsung has also used an underclocked version of the chipset. While the Exynos 9810 can reach a max clock speed of 2.9GHz, the Galaxy S9+ restricts it to 2.7Ghz. That’s probably to maintain uniformity with the Qualcomm Snapdragono 845 chipset which powers the device in some regions. The Snapdragon 845 can go up to 2.8Ghz., Nevertheless, despite a no-show in benchmark results, the Galaxy S9+ which comes with 6GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage is no slouch. It can handle just about anything you throw at it. Just not as efficiently as, say, the iPhone X, but that’s a whole different device. It’s right up there with the Pixel 2 and the OnePlus 5T which are among the fastest Android phones. Samsung also promised carrier aggregration for LTE networks including Reliance Jio and Airtel with maximum speeds up to 250Mbps, but in our real world tests, we got speeds only up to 8Mbps on Reliance Jio which is the standard 4G speed we get., By looking at the Galaxy S9+, it’s clear that Android performance has hit a peak. There can be theoretical boost in performance, but in the real world you will hardly find a discernible difference from last year’s flagships., Software: Needs more work
 , , Samsung’s software has been the biggest pain point of using the flagship device. It’s just not as snappy as stock Android. That somewhat changed last year with the introduction of Samsung Experience, a more refined user interface that not only makes the device look more aesthetically pleasing, but also improves the performance., Straight off, you will be locked down into Samsung’s ecosystem right when you first boot the device. Logging into your Samsung account will give you access to its cloud storage, keep your call list and texts backed up along with all your photos and videos. There’s also the Google route if you prefer that. There are dual instances of the Gallery app, Mail and the Browser as well as Samsung’s own app store., , The big change this time is the new AR Emoji, which as you can guess from the name, is a rival to Apple’s Animoji. It seemed a work in progress though. Samsung doesn’t use a 3D-mapping dot projector like the iPhone X. It also doesn’t provide enough diversity to accommodate every unique user. Also, they’re not the same as Animojis. Unlike Animoji that animates the regular emojis with your facial expressions, AR Emoji are essentially various expressions of your face. But the best part about them is that you can share them on any app, unlike Animojis that can only be shared via iMessage., The curved edges of the screen also doubles up as a productivity hotspot. You can swipe from the edges to bring up favourite apps, contacts, and other options. There are way too many customisation options for me to include in this review, but the ones to note are the ability to dial down the display resolution, play around with the lockscreen texts and fonts as well as the home screen., The Samsung Health app is an unsung hero though. It can reduce your dependence on a fitness band. The Health app can measure not only your heart beat, but also your Sp02 levels and using them, calculate your stress level. The accuracy may not be perfect, but it does the job for an average joe.

Since this is a phone centered around the camera, the camera app has received most of my scrutiny. To keep things short, it’s too cumbersome to use fluidly. The icons are too tiny and accidental touches ruin the experience. I accidentally switched to the front camera multiple times because of the swipe gesture while random touches around the edges kept switching the modes around without me asking for it., Moving on, the UI is now more lightweight than ever, but it’s quite complicated for someone new to the ecosystem. The Settings Menu is not as intuitive as Stock Android and Samsung’s new ‘Intelligent scan’, which combines the iris scanner and the face recognition, is visibly slower than the competition. Although, it’s nice to see Samsung being confident enough to allow facial recognition to authenticate purchases and passwords., Samsung’s security is now stronger than ever. The Samsung Pass app stores all your password and uses your biometric to authenticate them whenever you need it. Most features have been carried over from its predecessor including the Secure Folder, which allows a secure space to store files and apps. Samsung also combined its iris scanning and facial recognition into one feature called ‘smart scan’ which does work better than before, but isn’t as fast as the OnePlus 5T, nor is it as reliable as Apple’s FaceID. Smart Scan does not use 3D mapping to authenticate faces, it uses the front camera which makes it vulnerable somewhat. It’s even more concerning because Smart Scan can now be used to authenticate payments and passwords. However, the face unlock works even in complete darkness. It takes its time, yes, but uses the unbelievably bright screen to work it out. The fingerprint sensor, even though more ergonomically placed this time, is not the fastest one around. It took me a good 2 seconds to unlock the phone using my fingerprint., Then there’s Bixby. It remains to be half-baked and very much forgettable. The annoying Bixby button makes things even worse as an accidental touch summons Bixby even when I was in the middle of playing a game or shooting a video. Very annoying. Bixby voice is not available right now and you can only converse with Bixby by long-pressing the dedicated button. Even then, you have to speak things very slowly as the AI-assistant has difficulty understanding Indian accents. It is beyond me why anybody would ditch the reliable Google Assistant for Bixby., Display: Unbelievably bright, , No matter how much Samsung wants to center the S9+ around its dual-aperture camera, the display is still the most prominent thing about this device. Samsung introduced the Infinity Display with the S8 and the S8+ last year and while the display on the S9+ looks mostly similar, Samsung has made some more advancements in making the panel look even better., For the uninitiated, the panel on the S8+ is a quad HD Super AMOLED display of 6.2-inches with the edges curved to blend with the rest of the body. The display stretches from the top to the bottom with 18.5:1 aspect ratio and a pixel density of 529 ppi. It is Mobile HDR compatible and certified by the UHD Alliance.  , DisplayMate, a leading display certification firm rated the panel on the S9+ it’s highest ever A+ grade, and for good reason. The display is visibly brighter than its predecessor and the colours are more accurate than ever. Like last year, the S9+ too has diamond pixels that packs the pixels closer to each other to achieve a higher density., The auto brightness is extremely responsive and adjusts the luminescence of the panel perfectly with a change in ambient light. That way, the display, even though very bright, doesn’t strain the eye. There’s a night mode to boot as well., The S9+ also goes a step further to offer four different display modes for photo, cinema and a basic. There’s another mode that switches between the three automatically based on the content called Adaptive Display. The adaptive display also changes the white point of the display based on the ambient light, similar to what iPhone’s TrueTone display does. You can also manually adjust the colour balance and even adjust the temperature of each colour individually. That’s a lot of tweaking, but if you are not literate in display calibration, it’s better to leave them untouched.

Design: Refined, not reimagined, , Place the S8+ and the S9+ side by side and you will not be able to tell the difference. Samsung kept the design of the phone unchanged from its predecessors, but there are progressive refinements in place. The S9+ continues to have the highly streamlined design where the display curves along the edges to blend in with the rest of the body. Also, the 3.5mm headphone jack survives! Samsung has shaved the bezels off the S9+ and the display now takes up even more real estate on the front.  , , The S9+ is also bulkier than before. Samsung has used a sturdier grade of aluminium for the frame of the device that absorbs the shock better and prevent it from being passed to the display. As a result, the S9+ weighs a hefty 189 grams. It’s also thicker than before and slightly smaller than the S8+., , Turn the phone around and you will find more to discern the S9+ from the S8+. There’s a dual camera stack at the back, placed centrally at the back. Down below is the fingerprint sensor, which has been moved to the position to make it more accessible. Samsung seems to have heeded to user feedback and made the fingerprint sensor easier to access., Having said that, between the S9 and the S9+, the S9 feels more compact and ergonomic. Thanks to its smaller size, the S9 is easier to operate with one hand while the S9+ feels unwieldy. The added heft means you have to hold the phone tighter and still have to move your hands up and down the phone to reach content on the top of the screen., Battery: Humble capacity, yet reliable, , Yet another thing that remained unchanged in the S9+ is the battery capacity. Samsung is still taking no risk after the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco and powered the S9+ with the same 3,500mAh battery as the S8+. Thanks to the new chipset though, the 3,500mAh battery can last a little bit longer than its predecessor, but only slightly. The extra brightness negates the improvement in power efficiency. Still, you can easily squeeze a day and a half worth of juice out of the S9+, if you are using the phone as a daily driver., PCMark’s battery test ran for 11 hours 25 minutes which is nearly the same as the S8+. In the real world, you can easily get around 13-14 hours of screen on time. It also charges quite fast, around 30 percent in 15 minutes which gives 6 hours of battery on normal use., Bottomline, The Galaxy S9+ is the best Android phone in the market right now. It has a stunning display which remains unmatched, top of the line hardware and a camera that pushes the boundaries of mobile photography further than ever before. Yet, the best Android phone is the best by only a hairline. Last year’s flagships like the Google Pixel 2 and the OnePlus 5T come dangerously close to the S9+ in terms of imaging prowess and performance respectively. This can be taken as evidence that smartphones are close to hitting its peak. Nevertheless, the S9+ is more of a refinement than a ‘reimagination’ and if you already own the S8+, you can give this one a skip."
2238,,samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review-100081,0,0,2019-05-22,100081,Subhrojit Mallick,Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review-100081.html,"The Samsung Galaxy S9+ is the best Android smartphone available right. It's looks stunning especially because of the astoundingly bright display and a design that blends the display to the rest of the body. But more than that, this time, Samsung has taken a new approach to improving the low-light performance of the camera. The rear camera can switch between two apertures. The camera, if one knows how to take good photos, can produce some high-quality shots under poor lighting, especially in a restaurant on indoors, but there are limitations. Samsung's aggressive noise reduction alogrithms keeps the image from being perfect, but it's a commendable effort nonetheless. You can't go wrong with the S9+. It has everything you want from a top-of-the-line flagship phone — Latest high-level hardware, excellent design, high security, and an excellent camera. Having said that, it isn't much different from its predecessor, the Galaxy S8+, which is now cheaper and hence, a more value-for-money proposition. The Galaxy S9+ is evidence that this is an iterative year for Samsung and if you have been holding out on buying a good Android flagship, this is the one to get right now., , As much as Samsung likes to mock Apple, the Cupertino giant’s philosophies are shaping up the Android landscape. No, I’m not talking about the notch. That’s inevitable. I’m referring to the deeper philosophy that Steve Jobs swore by — Don’t fix what ain’t broken. In the fewest of words, that’s how you can describe the new Samsung Galaxy S9+. It can be interpreted as both good and bad. Samsung may not get extra points for introducing a new design with the S9+, but it did give the company enough leeway to work on the finer things, those that don’t always meet the eye, but do end up making a difference., Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, Samsung Galaxy M30 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus Review, Samsung Galaxy A30 Review, The Galaxy S9+ is evidence that this is going to be an iterative year for Samsung. As much as it would like to call the Galaxy S9+ a ‘reimagination’ of the smartphone, it’s more of a refinement with some inevitable upgrades., There is of course the latest hardware inside. Depending on where you buy, the S9+ is powered by either Qualcomm’s latest chip or Samsung’s own 10nm chipset. There’s an Rs 8000 wedge between the Galaxy S9 and the larger Galaxy S9+ which is justified by not just a taller screen, but also more memory and a dual camera stack at the back., But is worth the upgrade? More importantly, is it the best Android phone around right now? We find out., Camera: From low light to more light, , If last year’s Galaxy S8 was all about the Infinity Display, this year, the focus is on the camera. So that’s where the review should start, right? The problem that Samsung wanted to address with the Galaxy S9 and the S9+ is low light photography. The company has already set a benchmark for daylight imaging, and now it wants to redefine night photography. It’s an ambitious attempt, no doubt, but with its own shortcomings. We did a detailed camera analysis of the Galaxy S9+ which you can read to get more context., , But before I dive further, allow me to lay down the specs at hand. The Galaxy S9+ sports a 12-megapixel wide angle-telephoto dual-camera stack at the back. It’s actually the same as that on the Galaxy Note 8. But with a small, but significant change. Variable aperture. Samsung borrowed the tech from its own super-expensive flip phone (the $2,000 W2018) that launched in China last year and introduced it to the world. The primary wide-angle 26mm is fitted with a dual aperture module that can shift the aperture from the usual F/2.4 aperture to a wider F/1.5 for low light shots. This is where the magic happens. The dual aperture feature is one of the primary reasons to buy this phone, if not the only one. We did a full-fledged camera analysis of the Galaxy S9+ if you are interested in the nitty-gritties., 
Aperture set to F/2.4 ( Notice the second sensor)


Aperture set to F/1.5 (notice the primary camera hole is wider here), The wider aperture comes into play when there’s less light in the frame. Samsung automatically switches to F/1.5 when brightness falls below a certain point. You can also switch it manually from the Pro mode, along with the shutter speed, ISO, and the likes. Long story short, the F/1.5 aperture allows more light into the sensor and night shots are nicely lit up. It’s especially useful if you are in a dimly lit restaurant. The difference is quite discernible.  But sometimes a bit too much. Most of the times the shots will come out surprisingly good. The details will be quite sharp and the frame will be perfectly lit. But sometimes, it becomes difficult to say whether the photo has been taken in a poorly-lit surrounding or a well-lit one. There’s a lot of light of coming in and the 1/2.55” sensor cannot possibly accommodate it all. That sometimes leads to the shots being overexposed. The wider aperture sometimes makes things too bright, while the F/2.4 aperture makes it too dark. Ideally, there should have been a third aperture setting, somewhere around F/1.7 to F/2.0, to bridge that big a jump, but I might just be asking too much. It’s commendable no doubt what Samsung has managed to achieve here. The Galaxy S9+ can easily light up poorly-lit frames better than anyone there, but the finishing touch is missing., 
Exif: F/2.4, 1/33 sec shutter speed, ISO 200, 
Exif: F/1.5, 1/33 sec shutter speed, ISO 1600, If the hardware takes the future of smartphone low-light photography further, Samsung’s algorithms keep it from breaking new ground. The software behind the scenes aggressively reduce noise from the photo, sometimes smudging the details in order to make things look smooth. There’s the question of that yellow tint on night shots that have been there in Samsung phones since ages. There might be an audience for it, but it’s not my cup of tea. Add to that a layer of saturation and increased contrast, and you get a photo that might look good on the astoundingly bright AMOLED display, but to be honest, it just comes out as artificial. The iPhone X and the Pixel 2 keep things more realistic. The Pixel 2 can preserve the details even better while the iPhone X will take a better composed shot. Samsung has been taking a different approach to low-light photography and with the Galaxy S9+, it has reached new extremes. Both in a good way, and bad, depending on where you stand., 
Exif: F/2.4, 1/6 sec shutter speed, ISO 100, 
Exif: F/1.5, 1/20 sec shutter speed, ISO 250, Nevertheless, this is indeed a big jump over how everyone else has been tackling the low-light barrier, and Samsung comes close to overcoming it., , Yet another highlight of the camera is the ability to record slow motion videos at 960 frames per seconds. That’s a big jump from the 240fps slo-mo the S8+ is capable of. It’s a fun tool to play around with. If you are actively trying to use the feature, you will suddenly be super aware of your surroundings, looking for mundane things to show in slo-mo. It needs a lot of light to work though. The feature is practically useless when there’s poor lighting. It also records the videos at 720p., If you know how to leverage the Pro Mode, you can also use the F/1.5 aperture coupled with a suitable shutter speed to get a natural shallow depth of field in your macro shots in the day. Else, there’s of course the Live Focus mode that was there on the Galaxy Note 8. It works just like the Note 8. Well-detailed bokeh shots in the day and a dark noisy output at night., The Galaxy S9+’s mojo revolves primarily around the camera. And for the most part, it remains a desirable proposition. But with the variable aperture,  this one seems more geared towards professionals who have an idea of photography. In the hands of an amateur, the results might not be so satisfactory, but there’s tremendous potential in the camera, just waiting for you to use., Performance: Fast, but not the fastest,  ,  , As we have noted in a detailed performance analysis of the Galaxy S9+ before, the phone might be the fastest Android phone out there, but it’s definitely not the fastest phone. Our suite of benchmarking apps revealed the Galaxy S9+ falls way short of the iPhone X, which is currently the most powerful phone in the market. Despite the Exynos 9810 chipset which has been manufactured on a 10nm LPE process, powering the Galaxy S9+, it’s no match for the iPhone X’s A11 Bionic chipset., Samsung has also used an underclocked version of the chipset. While the Exynos 9810 can reach a max clock speed of 2.9GHz, the Galaxy S9+ restricts it to 2.7Ghz. That’s probably to maintain uniformity with the Qualcomm Snapdragono 845 chipset which powers the device in some regions. The Snapdragon 845 can go up to 2.8Ghz., Nevertheless, despite a no-show in benchmark results, the Galaxy S9+ which comes with 6GB of RAM and up to 256GB of storage is no slouch. It can handle just about anything you throw at it. Just not as efficiently as, say, the iPhone X, but that’s a whole different device. It’s right up there with the Pixel 2 and the OnePlus 5T which are among the fastest Android phones. Samsung also promised carrier aggregration for LTE networks including Reliance Jio and Airtel with maximum speeds up to 250Mbps, but in our real world tests, we got speeds only up to 8Mbps on Reliance Jio which is the standard 4G speed we get., By looking at the Galaxy S9+, it’s clear that Android performance has hit a peak. There can be theoretical boost in performance, but in the real world you will hardly find a discernible difference from last year’s flagships., Software: Needs more work
 , , Samsung’s software has been the biggest pain point of using the flagship device. It’s just not as snappy as stock Android. That somewhat changed last year with the introduction of Samsung Experience, a more refined user interface that not only makes the device look more aesthetically pleasing, but also improves the performance., Straight off, you will be locked down into Samsung’s ecosystem right when you first boot the device. Logging into your Samsung account will give you access to its cloud storage, keep your call list and texts backed up along with all your photos and videos. There’s also the Google route if you prefer that. There are dual instances of the Gallery app, Mail and the Browser as well as Samsung’s own app store., , The big change this time is the new AR Emoji, which as you can guess from the name, is a rival to Apple’s Animoji. It seemed a work in progress though. Samsung doesn’t use a 3D-mapping dot projector like the iPhone X. It also doesn’t provide enough diversity to accommodate every unique user. Also, they’re not the same as Animojis. Unlike Animoji that animates the regular emojis with your facial expressions, AR Emoji are essentially various expressions of your face. But the best part about them is that you can share them on any app, unlike Animojis that can only be shared via iMessage., The curved edges of the screen also doubles up as a productivity hotspot. You can swipe from the edges to bring up favourite apps, contacts, and other options. There are way too many customisation options for me to include in this review, but the ones to note are the ability to dial down the display resolution, play around with the lockscreen texts and fonts as well as the home screen., The Samsung Health app is an unsung hero though. It can reduce your dependence on a fitness band. The Health app can measure not only your heart beat, but also your Sp02 levels and using them, calculate your stress level. The accuracy may not be perfect, but it does the job for an average joe.

Since this is a phone centered around the camera, the camera app has received most of my scrutiny. To keep things short, it’s too cumbersome to use fluidly. The icons are too tiny and accidental touches ruin the experience. I accidentally switched to the front camera multiple times because of the swipe gesture while random touches around the edges kept switching the modes around without me asking for it., Moving on, the UI is now more lightweight than ever, but it’s quite complicated for someone new to the ecosystem. The Settings Menu is not as intuitive as Stock Android and Samsung’s new ‘Intelligent scan’, which combines the iris scanner and the face recognition, is visibly slower than the competition. Although, it’s nice to see Samsung being confident enough to allow facial recognition to authenticate purchases and passwords., Samsung’s security is now stronger than ever. The Samsung Pass app stores all your password and uses your biometric to authenticate them whenever you need it. Most features have been carried over from its predecessor including the Secure Folder, which allows a secure space to store files and apps. Samsung also combined its iris scanning and facial recognition into one feature called ‘smart scan’ which does work better than before, but isn’t as fast as the OnePlus 5T, nor is it as reliable as Apple’s FaceID. Smart Scan does not use 3D mapping to authenticate faces, it uses the front camera which makes it vulnerable somewhat. It’s even more concerning because Smart Scan can now be used to authenticate payments and passwords. However, the face unlock works even in complete darkness. It takes its time, yes, but uses the unbelievably bright screen to work it out. The fingerprint sensor, even though more ergonomically placed this time, is not the fastest one around. It took me a good 2 seconds to unlock the phone using my fingerprint., Then there’s Bixby. It remains to be half-baked and very much forgettable. The annoying Bixby button makes things even worse as an accidental touch summons Bixby even when I was in the middle of playing a game or shooting a video. Very annoying. Bixby voice is not available right now and you can only converse with Bixby by long-pressing the dedicated button. Even then, you have to speak things very slowly as the AI-assistant has difficulty understanding Indian accents. It is beyond me why anybody would ditch the reliable Google Assistant for Bixby., Display: Unbelievably bright, , No matter how much Samsung wants to center the S9+ around its dual-aperture camera, the display is still the most prominent thing about this device. Samsung introduced the Infinity Display with the S8 and the S8+ last year and while the display on the S9+ looks mostly similar, Samsung has made some more advancements in making the panel look even better., For the uninitiated, the panel on the S8+ is a quad HD Super AMOLED display of 6.2-inches with the edges curved to blend with the rest of the body. The display stretches from the top to the bottom with 18.5:1 aspect ratio and a pixel density of 529 ppi. It is Mobile HDR compatible and certified by the UHD Alliance.  , DisplayMate, a leading display certification firm rated the panel on the S9+ it’s highest ever A+ grade, and for good reason. The display is visibly brighter than its predecessor and the colours are more accurate than ever. Like last year, the S9+ too has diamond pixels that packs the pixels closer to each other to achieve a higher density., The auto brightness is extremely responsive and adjusts the luminescence of the panel perfectly with a change in ambient light. That way, the display, even though very bright, doesn’t strain the eye. There’s a night mode to boot as well., The S9+ also goes a step further to offer four different display modes for photo, cinema and a basic. There’s another mode that switches between the three automatically based on the content called Adaptive Display. The adaptive display also changes the white point of the display based on the ambient light, similar to what iPhone’s TrueTone display does. You can also manually adjust the colour balance and even adjust the temperature of each colour individually. That’s a lot of tweaking, but if you are not literate in display calibration, it’s better to leave them untouched.

Design: Refined, not reimagined, , Place the S8+ and the S9+ side by side and you will not be able to tell the difference. Samsung kept the design of the phone unchanged from its predecessors, but there are progressive refinements in place. The S9+ continues to have the highly streamlined design where the display curves along the edges to blend in with the rest of the body. Also, the 3.5mm headphone jack survives! Samsung has shaved the bezels off the S9+ and the display now takes up even more real estate on the front.  , , The S9+ is also bulkier than before. Samsung has used a sturdier grade of aluminium for the frame of the device that absorbs the shock better and prevent it from being passed to the display. As a result, the S9+ weighs a hefty 189 grams. It’s also thicker than before and slightly smaller than the S8+., , Turn the phone around and you will find more to discern the S9+ from the S8+. There’s a dual camera stack at the back, placed centrally at the back. Down below is the fingerprint sensor, which has been moved to the position to make it more accessible. Samsung seems to have heeded to user feedback and made the fingerprint sensor easier to access., Having said that, between the S9 and the S9+, the S9 feels more compact and ergonomic. Thanks to its smaller size, the S9 is easier to operate with one hand while the S9+ feels unwieldy. The added heft means you have to hold the phone tighter and still have to move your hands up and down the phone to reach content on the top of the screen., Battery: Humble capacity, yet reliable, , Yet another thing that remained unchanged in the S9+ is the battery capacity. Samsung is still taking no risk after the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco and powered the S9+ with the same 3,500mAh battery as the S8+. Thanks to the new chipset though, the 3,500mAh battery can last a little bit longer than its predecessor, but only slightly. The extra brightness negates the improvement in power efficiency. Still, you can easily squeeze a day and a half worth of juice out of the S9+, if you are using the phone as a daily driver., PCMark’s battery test ran for 11 hours 25 minutes which is nearly the same as the S8+. In the real world, you can easily get around 13-14 hours of screen on time. It also charges quite fast, around 30 percent in 15 minutes which gives 6 hours of battery on normal use., Bottomline, The Galaxy S9+ is the best Android phone in the market right now. It has a stunning display which remains unmatched, top of the line hardware and a camera that pushes the boundaries of mobile photography further than ever before. Yet, the best Android phone is the best by only a hairline. Last year’s flagships like the Google Pixel 2 and the OnePlus 5T come dangerously close to the S9+ in terms of imaging prowess and performance respectively. This can be taken as evidence that smartphones are close to hitting its peak. Nevertheless, the S9+ is more of a refinement than a ‘reimagination’ and if you already own the S8+, you can give this one a skip."
2405,,xiaomi-mi-a2-review-125589,0,0,2019-05-22,125589,Subhrojit Mallick,Xiaomi Mi A2 Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/xiaomi-mi-a2-review-125589.html,"The Xiaomi Mi A2 is a jack of all trades and master of some. It has a stellar camera and reliable performance, packaged in a robust, functional design. Despite a few compromises here and there, the A2 stands up to its name of offering a smooth, consistent experience and improves largely on its imaging prowess, especially in low-light., , When Xiaomi launched the Mi A1 last year, it raised our collective expectations higher. The company, no longer an upstart, was known for giving a big bang for the buck in terms of hardware, while refraining from experimenting with the UI. That changed when the Mi A1 came with stock Android. It was a testament to how stable performance could be had with mid-range specs. Fast forward a year later, the Mi A2 has arrived at a starting price of Rs 16,999, sealing that belief even further. I received the review unit a few days before the launch, which gave me ample time to test the important aspects of the phone, and boy oh boy, was I impressed. Xiaomi has definitely bumped up the performance of the phone, but the most startling improvement has been in its imaging prowess. Where phones in the upper mid-range segment are focusing on one aspect at a time (Honor Play, Huawei P20 Lite), the Mi A2 offers a smooth and reliable experience in almost all departments. It’s a good phone. One that will not leave you disappointed. And this review will prove exactly that. Read on!, Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, , It’s easy to spot the Xiaomi DNA in the Mi A2’s design. It takes the robust utilitarian design of the Redmi Note 5 Pro and builds on top of it. Lift it up and you will feel the smooth metal finish of the back. Yes, the Mi A2 bucks the trend of the glass-sandwich design to stick to a metal unibody design. The anodised finish is smooth but slippery, and is almost completely resistant to smudges. The Mi A2 is incredibly thin at just 7.3mm at its thinnest. That’s achieved thanks to the curved edges that wrap around the display. There’s also Gorilla Glass 5 on top of the panel for added protection. It’s clear that Xiaomi wants this phone to last., While the body is built tough with no flex whatsoever, the buttons on the right side edge of the phone are a little wobbly. Many users including a colleague have complained about the buttons failing to register input after just a few months of usage. That fear remains with the Mi A2 as well. Another eyesore in the design is the camera bump. The vertically aligned dual camera unit on the top left corner juts out of the thin body by around half a millimeter. It’s impossible to keep the phone stable on a surface as a result. Xiaomi explains this away by saying the bump allows the auto-focus motor more space, which is an acceptable trade-off to me. On the back, there’s the fingerprint sensor centrally placed where the finger can reach easily and the Mi Logo is flushed to the body at the bottom. The front is dominated by the display. Here again, the Mi A2 sticks to the tried and tested 18:9 display instead of going for the notch. The notch is there on the Mi A2 Lite, but that’s not coming to India for now. The bezels have certainly lessened from all sides. Xiaomi has replaced the capacitive navigation buttons with on-screen navigation keys (which disappear when watching content) maximising the real estate., The slim form factor of the Mi A2 makes it easy to hold the phone and operate. It’s still difficult to use it with just one-hand, but I had no problem typing out quick replies with one hand. I’m nitpicking here but the weight of the phone isn’t evenly distributed as the phone is a little top-heavy. I’ve had situations while using the phone when it was about to tumble out of my hand. The slippery surface doesn’t help with that either. The phone does come with a transparent TPU case that takes care of both the camera bump and the slippery nature., The Mi A2 isn’t going to make heads turn like the crop of Honor and Huawei phones does. But it absolutely functional and reliable and is bound to last longer than most glass-backed phones., , The new display format allows the Mi A2 to provide more real estate without increasing the size of the phone by much. It has a similar 18:9 IPS LCD display introduced in the Redmi Note 5 Pro and stretches to 5.99-inches diagonally. The panel has a full HD resolution, meaning the pixel density is around 403ppi. If you seen the display on the Redmi Note 5 Pro, you’ll be familiar with the A2’s panel. It’s sufficiently bright and vibrant, although it’s not the most colour accurate one. The colour temperature is slightly on the cooler side and there’s no way to tweak it. Customisation options include turning on adaptive brightness that sets the brightness based on ambient light, scheduling the blue light filter that makes the screen glow with an amber tinge to protect your eyes. The phone also wakes up discreetly when there’s a new notification which doesn’t consume a lot of battery., Being an 18:9 display means it’s ahead of its time. Most videos are still in the 16:9 format and they appear letterboxed. YouTube videos do scale up to fit the larger screen, but it also crops the content slightly. I caught up on the first season of The Crown on Netflix and it was quite immersive. Games too take up the entire real estate and multi-tasking is much easier on this format. Overall, the 18:9 panel is a certain improvement and if you’re coming from the Mi A1, you’ll definitely find a lot to talk about the Mi A2’s panel., One of the few snags of the Mi A1 was the compromise on the firepower. While it was certainly more efficient, the Snapdragon 625 SoC on the Mi A1 was a downgrade in terms of raw performance. That’s taken care of in the Mi A2 as it is powered by the Snapdragon 660. It’s the top-of-the-line mid-range chipset from Qualcomm that packs Kryo 260 cores with a max clock speed of 2.2GHz. That’s paired with an Adreno 512 GPU that promises a 30 percent improvement in graphical performance over its previous generation. It’s the most powerful 6-series chipset from Qualcomm and it makes the Mi A2 run like a horse. Yet, the introduction of the Honor Play in that sub-20k price segment kind of spoils things for Xiaomi’s offering. The Honor Play uses a flagship level chipset and being in the same price range, it makes the Mi A2 look sort of like David in front of Goliath. The benchmark results drives the point further. The Mi A2 scored 128895 on AnTuTu while on Geekbench Single Core and Multi Core tests, it registered 1632 and 3233 points respectively. On GFX Bench’s Car Chase, it managed a paltry 8.5 fps.  In comparison, the Honor Play that is powered by the flagship Kirin 970 SoC scored 202639 in AnTuTu while on Geekbench Single Core and Multi Core it scored 1901 and 6604. The stark difference in the two phones become more evident in the GFXBench’s Car Chase test where the Honor Play registered 21 frames per second., , , Clearly, the Mi A2 falls far behind the Honor Play, but that’s more for mobile gamers. Gaming isn’t the only aspect of smartphone usage though. In my opinion, the A2 is aimed at everyday users who are more dynamic in their usage. I used the A2 while covering ChinaJoy expo at Shanghai as my primary device and the experience was more than satisfactory. At its peak, my usage centered around frequent use of the camera, back and forth messaging with my team on Messenger, looking up information on Chrome (there were 58 tabs open at one point!!), Google Translate’s live translation in the background, and of course social media browsing while I took a break. Despite all this, the phone never slowed down one bit. I was able to switch between apps easily with minimal downtime in between. Apps also loaded without much of a delay., The phone did register some instability issues. Apps like Instagram and even Google search quit often during my usage in China. That could either be because it was running on pre-launch software or the Great Firewall of China. Nevertheless, in case it’s an issue with firmware optimisations, Xiaomi is bound to address it in a future OTA update., Speaking of updates, the Mi A2 is going to be future-proof thanks to its Android One certification. The phone will receive monthly security updates (it was already running the July security patch) along with an upgrade to Android Pie (yep, that’s the name) when it becomes available.  Its predecessor, the Mi A1’s track record of providing updates hasn’t been all that stellar. The Mi A1 received the Oreo update well after a lot of OEMs pushed out updates for their respective phones, although security updates were pushed out on time regularly. The Android One certification also means the phone runs on pure stock Android Oreo 8.1. That’s one of the major reasons behind the phone’s smooth operability, like it was on the Mi A1. Android One is Google’s program to showcase Android at its purest and to a lot of extent, the Mi A2 feels like the Pixel. It has the same launcher, the same set of apps and the same update policy. It’s also just as responsive as the Pixel and it’s heartening to see such a smooth experience in a mid-range phone. There’s almost no bloat with the only Xiaomi apps being the Mi Feedback and Mi Store app (which can be uninstalled). Optionally, you can download the Mi Remote app, as this comes with the IR sensor on top giving you control over your appliances. The camera app is also Xiaomi’s own which I’ll talk about in the next section., Gaming on the Mi A2 is also an acceptable experience. PubG mobile ran on medium graphics with no framedrops whatsoever. While the Mi A2 doesn’t run the popular battle royale game at Ultra HDR Realistic graphics, it gives a stable enough performance in medium graphics. Other, less intensive games like Asphalt Nitro and Dead Trigger 2 also didn’t register any frame drops. But the point remains that if you are serious about mobile gaming, this isn’t the best option out there. The thermals of the phone are a little on the higher side as well. A single match of PubG was enough to heat up the phone to a warm 42 degrees. The heating mostly happens around the camera unit. Continuous video recording too made the phone warm, despite having a 14nm chipset which promises superior power efficiency. The heating was one of the few things off the mark in the phone, where ideally the temperature stays between 38 to 40 degrees which is the case with the Honor Play., Overall, the Mi A2 is an all-round performer. It doesn’t focus on one single aspect and instead, tries to offer an overall smooth experience no matter whether you are gaming, streaming TV shows or browsing social media. The Mi A1 set the benchmark for mid-rangers higher and the Mi A2 takes it even further. Having the same hardware and the same interface but with a lower price, the Mi A2 essentially eats into the goodwill earned by the Nokia 7 Plus which will have a difficult time convincing buyers to pay the extra premium for its sturdy and unique design., , The A series by Xiaomi seems to be a good platform for the company to experiment with flagship camera setups in the mid-range price segment. The A1 last year had a secondary telephoto lens with the option of 2X optical zoom. The A2, this time, brings pixel binning which is an imaging technology seen in expensive flagships like the Huawei P20 Pro. For this, the Mi A2 relies on a dual camera setup with a 12MP primary and a 20MP secondary lens. Both lenses have an aperture of f/1.85. The primary lens uses a Sony IMX 486 RS sensor with 1.25um pixel pitch that’s has been used in the Redmi Y2 and the Redmi Note 5 Pro. The secondary camera has a Sony IMX 376 that supports pixel binning by combining four 0.5um pixels into one 2um superpixel. The secondary sensor kicks in by default when there’s less light, but you can manually switch to it in the pro-mode., The camera app of the Mi A2 will be familiar to anyone who has used a Xiaomi device before. The shooting modes are lined up near the bottom of the screen, easily accessible with one hand. All you need to do is swipe left or right. Options like turning on HDR (which is on ‘auto mode’ by default), along with more granular settings like turning on self-timer, tilt-shift and group selfie mode sits on top of the screen. The focus pointer also doubles up as the shutter button which helps in taking photos quickly. The app is clean, minimalist and doesn’t come in the way of shooting. It takes some exploration to understand all its capabilities which, in my mind, is always a good thing as you keep discovering new features over the time of its usage., The camera itself is quite fast and snappy when there’s ample light. Under low light, the camera takes a little longer to prepare for the next shot which is understandable considering the pixel binning technology which takes time. The same technology is also there in the front camera which has also has the same 20MP sensor that’s there on the back, again with pixel binning trickery., I used the camera of the Mi A2 extensively during my trip to China. The attached image samples are a testament to just how good the camera was, no matter what situation I used it in., , , In both the images, the colour representation is near about accurate and there’s a lot of sharpness in the details. The focus in both the photos was set to infinity bringing the entire frame under focus preserving every minute detail of the scene. A 1:1 crop of the photos show there’s little loss in detail while zooming in. The windows of the distant houses retained the details. It’s dangerously close to what you get from flagship phone cameras. There’s also no AI processing happening. The camera of the Mi A2 doesn’t use much of software algorithms to enhance the photos, something that Huawei and Honor likes to do a lot. That means the photos doesn’t look unnatural. Instead, you get what you see. At least, a very close representation of it., , , Both shots have been taken against the sun, and in both the cases, the details in the shadow regions are perfectly preserved. Most other phones will output a silhouette, but the Mi A2’s HDR is quite commendable in offering a high dynamic range, once again proving its reliability in tricky situations., , , The camera’s strength becomes even more obvious when shooting indoors. Under more controlled lighting, the camera doesn’t disappoint. In both the photos above, you can see how well the camera has preserved the details. Every intricate details of the sprawling mall is captured (check out the full res photo in the Flickr Gallery linked below), while in the second photo, every individual face in the crowd can be distinctly made out, all under sharp focus., , Glossy surfaces, which are more difficult to focus for phones, also seem like a piece of cake for the A2. The chrome green of the McLaren 570S looks vibrant and easily catches the viewer’s attention., , , Close up shots of yummy food are deliciously good. Both the colours and details are near about accurate and the resulting shots are quite sharp. Perfect to make your viewers salivate! Once again, it’s commendable to see the Mi A2 doing everything without relying on heavy software trickery. It’s more consistent as a result, unlike its rivals., Now, most cameras excel at taking daytime and indoor photos. A true test of smartphone cameras is how well its low-light performance is. Xiaomi opted for a tried and tested method to improve low light photos which was one of the major complaints in the Mi A1. The result, as you can see in the samples below is a remarkable upgrade from its predecessor., , , , , , Late night strolls around the city of Shanghai gave me ample opportunities to put the low-light imaging of the Mi A2 to test. And safe to say, I was left quite impressed. This is when the secondary camera kicks in to capture imaging data in 2um super pixels reducing the signal to noise ratio. The samples above have been taken in ISO ranging from 500 to all the way up to 2000, and still the noise levels are at a bare minimum. In some cases, that has resulted in a lesser dynamic range as most of the area in both the frames are quite dark. Although, the part that’s illuminated come out quite well detailed. The third image is taken with the portrait mode and here too, the flowers are in perfect focus with a clean, blurry background. The second last photo also has fewer shadowy regions and most of the building is under sharp focus. Finally, the last sample which was taken at around 2 in the morning sums up the low-light camera performance of the Mi A2 perfectly. All the colours in the frame are captured well enough and the dark sky above is the least noisy I’ve seen over the years of testing mid-range phones. The colours itself are a little washed out, but that’s an acceptable trade-off to me, as long as the details under low light are preserved., The only tradeoff here is a lack of bigger sensor and more importantly, a lack of stabilisation. Neither EIS nor OIS is present in the camera, which in means in certain situations, photos come out quite blurry unless taken with the phone mounted on a tripod. Example given below:, , , , , The Mi A2 can take some stellar portrait shots, keeping the subject of the frame in focus and blurring out the rest of the background. It does so with the help of the secondary camera and by relying the Snapdragon 660’s AI Engine for semantic image segmentation, which is a term used to explain the technology behind separating the subject from the background. The blurring looks very natural with light sources turning into bokehs. The edges of the subjects are uniformly highlighted and details enhanced. This is hands down one of the best execution of the portrait mode I’ve seen on a mid-range phone and can give a lot of expensive phones a run for their money., Check out all the image samples posted above in high resolution here., Overall, the camera on the Mi A2 is one of the biggest reasons to buy the phone. A lot many phones now offer a stock Android experience with commendable hardware, but few come close to the all-round consistency of the A2’s camera., Owing to its slim form-factor, the battery capacity automatically becomes a trade-off. The Xiaomi Mi A2 packs a 3010mAh battery which is a hair lesser than what the Mi A1 had. Yet, thanks to a similarly efficient processor and lightweight stock Android, the A2 easily manages to last a work day which typically begins around 10AM till 8PM in the night. After heavy usage during my coverage of ChinaJoy, I had to put it on charge around 6:30PM, which is when the battery hit the 10 percent mark. On PCMark’s Work 2.0 Battery Test, the Mi A2 lasted 5 hours 13 minutes, which is a reassuring score. The Honor Play, in comparison has around 800mAh more battery capacity and ekes out around 9 hours of screen time on PCMark. The major quip with the phone comes with a slow charger out of the box even though it supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4.0 standard. Using a Quick Charge certified charger easily tops up the battery in around an hour, which otherwise takes a good 30 minutes more., Bottomline, The Mi A2 has all the elements of success. A robust, functional design, a reliable display, lightweight UI augmented by a fast-performing chipset and a class-leading camera (especially in the low-light segment) makes the Xiaomi Mi A2 hard to pass over. It’s definitely pricier than its predecessor but for good reason. The improvements in the camera and performance is reason enough to upgrade if you are using the Xiaomi Mi A1. There are some niggles and compromises in the form of an ugly camera bump, thermal instability and app crashes, which might indicates there’s more work needed in optimising the stock Android interface with the hardware. The Mi A2 is also going to be the first Xiaomi device in years to priced around the 20k mark. The Mi 5 was the last to command that price. There was of course the Mi Mix 2, but that’s in a different price segment altogether. It would be interesting to see whether the Mi A2 manages to sell as fast as Xiaomi’s Redmi phones especially when the asking price this time is much higher. As for me, I would recommend the Mi A2 over Honor Play for its all-round smooth experience.  The Honor Play is the superior performer here and it looks more premium as well, but the stock Android experience is much more usable and customisable than Honor’s EMUI. Furthermore, the camera on the Mi A2 will be a definite hit with anyone even remotely into photography. The Mi A2 is also a more reasonable buy over the Nokia 7 Plus which has been ruling the upper mid-range segment in our review sheets for a while now, simply for the lesser price tag it comes with."
2405,,xiaomi-mi-a2-review-125589,0,0,2019-05-22,125589,Subhrojit Mallick,Xiaomi Mi A2 Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/xiaomi-mi-a2-review-125589.html,"The Xiaomi Mi A2 is a jack of all trades and master of some. It has a stellar camera and reliable performance, packaged in a robust, functional design. Despite a few compromises here and there, the A2 stands up to its name of offering a smooth, consistent experience and improves largely on its imaging prowess, especially in low-light., , When Xiaomi launched the Mi A1 last year, it raised our collective expectations higher. The company, no longer an upstart, was known for giving a big bang for the buck in terms of hardware, while refraining from experimenting with the UI. That changed when the Mi A1 came with stock Android. It was a testament to how stable performance could be had with mid-range specs. Fast forward a year later, the Mi A2 has arrived at a starting price of Rs 16,999, sealing that belief even further. I received the review unit a few days before the launch, which gave me ample time to test the important aspects of the phone, and boy oh boy, was I impressed. Xiaomi has definitely bumped up the performance of the phone, but the most startling improvement has been in its imaging prowess. Where phones in the upper mid-range segment are focusing on one aspect at a time (Honor Play, Huawei P20 Lite), the Mi A2 offers a smooth and reliable experience in almost all departments. It’s a good phone. One that will not leave you disappointed. And this review will prove exactly that. Read on!, Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, , It’s easy to spot the Xiaomi DNA in the Mi A2’s design. It takes the robust utilitarian design of the Redmi Note 5 Pro and builds on top of it. Lift it up and you will feel the smooth metal finish of the back. Yes, the Mi A2 bucks the trend of the glass-sandwich design to stick to a metal unibody design. The anodised finish is smooth but slippery, and is almost completely resistant to smudges. The Mi A2 is incredibly thin at just 7.3mm at its thinnest. That’s achieved thanks to the curved edges that wrap around the display. There’s also Gorilla Glass 5 on top of the panel for added protection. It’s clear that Xiaomi wants this phone to last., While the body is built tough with no flex whatsoever, the buttons on the right side edge of the phone are a little wobbly. Many users including a colleague have complained about the buttons failing to register input after just a few months of usage. That fear remains with the Mi A2 as well. Another eyesore in the design is the camera bump. The vertically aligned dual camera unit on the top left corner juts out of the thin body by around half a millimeter. It’s impossible to keep the phone stable on a surface as a result. Xiaomi explains this away by saying the bump allows the auto-focus motor more space, which is an acceptable trade-off to me. On the back, there’s the fingerprint sensor centrally placed where the finger can reach easily and the Mi Logo is flushed to the body at the bottom. The front is dominated by the display. Here again, the Mi A2 sticks to the tried and tested 18:9 display instead of going for the notch. The notch is there on the Mi A2 Lite, but that’s not coming to India for now. The bezels have certainly lessened from all sides. Xiaomi has replaced the capacitive navigation buttons with on-screen navigation keys (which disappear when watching content) maximising the real estate., The slim form factor of the Mi A2 makes it easy to hold the phone and operate. It’s still difficult to use it with just one-hand, but I had no problem typing out quick replies with one hand. I’m nitpicking here but the weight of the phone isn’t evenly distributed as the phone is a little top-heavy. I’ve had situations while using the phone when it was about to tumble out of my hand. The slippery surface doesn’t help with that either. The phone does come with a transparent TPU case that takes care of both the camera bump and the slippery nature., The Mi A2 isn’t going to make heads turn like the crop of Honor and Huawei phones does. But it absolutely functional and reliable and is bound to last longer than most glass-backed phones., , The new display format allows the Mi A2 to provide more real estate without increasing the size of the phone by much. It has a similar 18:9 IPS LCD display introduced in the Redmi Note 5 Pro and stretches to 5.99-inches diagonally. The panel has a full HD resolution, meaning the pixel density is around 403ppi. If you seen the display on the Redmi Note 5 Pro, you’ll be familiar with the A2’s panel. It’s sufficiently bright and vibrant, although it’s not the most colour accurate one. The colour temperature is slightly on the cooler side and there’s no way to tweak it. Customisation options include turning on adaptive brightness that sets the brightness based on ambient light, scheduling the blue light filter that makes the screen glow with an amber tinge to protect your eyes. The phone also wakes up discreetly when there’s a new notification which doesn’t consume a lot of battery., Being an 18:9 display means it’s ahead of its time. Most videos are still in the 16:9 format and they appear letterboxed. YouTube videos do scale up to fit the larger screen, but it also crops the content slightly. I caught up on the first season of The Crown on Netflix and it was quite immersive. Games too take up the entire real estate and multi-tasking is much easier on this format. Overall, the 18:9 panel is a certain improvement and if you’re coming from the Mi A1, you’ll definitely find a lot to talk about the Mi A2’s panel., One of the few snags of the Mi A1 was the compromise on the firepower. While it was certainly more efficient, the Snapdragon 625 SoC on the Mi A1 was a downgrade in terms of raw performance. That’s taken care of in the Mi A2 as it is powered by the Snapdragon 660. It’s the top-of-the-line mid-range chipset from Qualcomm that packs Kryo 260 cores with a max clock speed of 2.2GHz. That’s paired with an Adreno 512 GPU that promises a 30 percent improvement in graphical performance over its previous generation. It’s the most powerful 6-series chipset from Qualcomm and it makes the Mi A2 run like a horse. Yet, the introduction of the Honor Play in that sub-20k price segment kind of spoils things for Xiaomi’s offering. The Honor Play uses a flagship level chipset and being in the same price range, it makes the Mi A2 look sort of like David in front of Goliath. The benchmark results drives the point further. The Mi A2 scored 128895 on AnTuTu while on Geekbench Single Core and Multi Core tests, it registered 1632 and 3233 points respectively. On GFX Bench’s Car Chase, it managed a paltry 8.5 fps.  In comparison, the Honor Play that is powered by the flagship Kirin 970 SoC scored 202639 in AnTuTu while on Geekbench Single Core and Multi Core it scored 1901 and 6604. The stark difference in the two phones become more evident in the GFXBench’s Car Chase test where the Honor Play registered 21 frames per second., , , Clearly, the Mi A2 falls far behind the Honor Play, but that’s more for mobile gamers. Gaming isn’t the only aspect of smartphone usage though. In my opinion, the A2 is aimed at everyday users who are more dynamic in their usage. I used the A2 while covering ChinaJoy expo at Shanghai as my primary device and the experience was more than satisfactory. At its peak, my usage centered around frequent use of the camera, back and forth messaging with my team on Messenger, looking up information on Chrome (there were 58 tabs open at one point!!), Google Translate’s live translation in the background, and of course social media browsing while I took a break. Despite all this, the phone never slowed down one bit. I was able to switch between apps easily with minimal downtime in between. Apps also loaded without much of a delay., The phone did register some instability issues. Apps like Instagram and even Google search quit often during my usage in China. That could either be because it was running on pre-launch software or the Great Firewall of China. Nevertheless, in case it’s an issue with firmware optimisations, Xiaomi is bound to address it in a future OTA update., Speaking of updates, the Mi A2 is going to be future-proof thanks to its Android One certification. The phone will receive monthly security updates (it was already running the July security patch) along with an upgrade to Android Pie (yep, that’s the name) when it becomes available.  Its predecessor, the Mi A1’s track record of providing updates hasn’t been all that stellar. The Mi A1 received the Oreo update well after a lot of OEMs pushed out updates for their respective phones, although security updates were pushed out on time regularly. The Android One certification also means the phone runs on pure stock Android Oreo 8.1. That’s one of the major reasons behind the phone’s smooth operability, like it was on the Mi A1. Android One is Google’s program to showcase Android at its purest and to a lot of extent, the Mi A2 feels like the Pixel. It has the same launcher, the same set of apps and the same update policy. It’s also just as responsive as the Pixel and it’s heartening to see such a smooth experience in a mid-range phone. There’s almost no bloat with the only Xiaomi apps being the Mi Feedback and Mi Store app (which can be uninstalled). Optionally, you can download the Mi Remote app, as this comes with the IR sensor on top giving you control over your appliances. The camera app is also Xiaomi’s own which I’ll talk about in the next section., Gaming on the Mi A2 is also an acceptable experience. PubG mobile ran on medium graphics with no framedrops whatsoever. While the Mi A2 doesn’t run the popular battle royale game at Ultra HDR Realistic graphics, it gives a stable enough performance in medium graphics. Other, less intensive games like Asphalt Nitro and Dead Trigger 2 also didn’t register any frame drops. But the point remains that if you are serious about mobile gaming, this isn’t the best option out there. The thermals of the phone are a little on the higher side as well. A single match of PubG was enough to heat up the phone to a warm 42 degrees. The heating mostly happens around the camera unit. Continuous video recording too made the phone warm, despite having a 14nm chipset which promises superior power efficiency. The heating was one of the few things off the mark in the phone, where ideally the temperature stays between 38 to 40 degrees which is the case with the Honor Play., Overall, the Mi A2 is an all-round performer. It doesn’t focus on one single aspect and instead, tries to offer an overall smooth experience no matter whether you are gaming, streaming TV shows or browsing social media. The Mi A1 set the benchmark for mid-rangers higher and the Mi A2 takes it even further. Having the same hardware and the same interface but with a lower price, the Mi A2 essentially eats into the goodwill earned by the Nokia 7 Plus which will have a difficult time convincing buyers to pay the extra premium for its sturdy and unique design., , The A series by Xiaomi seems to be a good platform for the company to experiment with flagship camera setups in the mid-range price segment. The A1 last year had a secondary telephoto lens with the option of 2X optical zoom. The A2, this time, brings pixel binning which is an imaging technology seen in expensive flagships like the Huawei P20 Pro. For this, the Mi A2 relies on a dual camera setup with a 12MP primary and a 20MP secondary lens. Both lenses have an aperture of f/1.85. The primary lens uses a Sony IMX 486 RS sensor with 1.25um pixel pitch that’s has been used in the Redmi Y2 and the Redmi Note 5 Pro. The secondary camera has a Sony IMX 376 that supports pixel binning by combining four 0.5um pixels into one 2um superpixel. The secondary sensor kicks in by default when there’s less light, but you can manually switch to it in the pro-mode., The camera app of the Mi A2 will be familiar to anyone who has used a Xiaomi device before. The shooting modes are lined up near the bottom of the screen, easily accessible with one hand. All you need to do is swipe left or right. Options like turning on HDR (which is on ‘auto mode’ by default), along with more granular settings like turning on self-timer, tilt-shift and group selfie mode sits on top of the screen. The focus pointer also doubles up as the shutter button which helps in taking photos quickly. The app is clean, minimalist and doesn’t come in the way of shooting. It takes some exploration to understand all its capabilities which, in my mind, is always a good thing as you keep discovering new features over the time of its usage., The camera itself is quite fast and snappy when there’s ample light. Under low light, the camera takes a little longer to prepare for the next shot which is understandable considering the pixel binning technology which takes time. The same technology is also there in the front camera which has also has the same 20MP sensor that’s there on the back, again with pixel binning trickery., I used the camera of the Mi A2 extensively during my trip to China. The attached image samples are a testament to just how good the camera was, no matter what situation I used it in., , , In both the images, the colour representation is near about accurate and there’s a lot of sharpness in the details. The focus in both the photos was set to infinity bringing the entire frame under focus preserving every minute detail of the scene. A 1:1 crop of the photos show there’s little loss in detail while zooming in. The windows of the distant houses retained the details. It’s dangerously close to what you get from flagship phone cameras. There’s also no AI processing happening. The camera of the Mi A2 doesn’t use much of software algorithms to enhance the photos, something that Huawei and Honor likes to do a lot. That means the photos doesn’t look unnatural. Instead, you get what you see. At least, a very close representation of it., , , Both shots have been taken against the sun, and in both the cases, the details in the shadow regions are perfectly preserved. Most other phones will output a silhouette, but the Mi A2’s HDR is quite commendable in offering a high dynamic range, once again proving its reliability in tricky situations., , , The camera’s strength becomes even more obvious when shooting indoors. Under more controlled lighting, the camera doesn’t disappoint. In both the photos above, you can see how well the camera has preserved the details. Every intricate details of the sprawling mall is captured (check out the full res photo in the Flickr Gallery linked below), while in the second photo, every individual face in the crowd can be distinctly made out, all under sharp focus., , Glossy surfaces, which are more difficult to focus for phones, also seem like a piece of cake for the A2. The chrome green of the McLaren 570S looks vibrant and easily catches the viewer’s attention., , , Close up shots of yummy food are deliciously good. Both the colours and details are near about accurate and the resulting shots are quite sharp. Perfect to make your viewers salivate! Once again, it’s commendable to see the Mi A2 doing everything without relying on heavy software trickery. It’s more consistent as a result, unlike its rivals., Now, most cameras excel at taking daytime and indoor photos. A true test of smartphone cameras is how well its low-light performance is. Xiaomi opted for a tried and tested method to improve low light photos which was one of the major complaints in the Mi A1.

And safe to say, I was left quite impressed. This is when the secondary camera kicks in to capture imaging data in 2um super pixels reducing the signal to noise ratio. The samples above have been taken in ISO ranging from 500 to all the way up to 2000, and still the noise levels are at a bare minimum. In some cases, that has resulted in a lesser dynamic range as most of the area in both the frames are quite dark. Although, the part that’s illuminated come out quite well detailed. The third image is taken with the portrait mode and here too, the flowers are in perfect focus with a clean, blurry background. The second last photo also has fewer shadowy regions and most of the building is under sharp focus. Finally, the last sample which was taken at around 2 in the morning sums up the low-light camera performance of the Mi A2 perfectly. All the colours in the frame are captured well enough and the dark sky above is the least noisy I’ve seen over the years of testing mid-range phones. The colours itself are a little washed out, but that’s an acceptable trade-off to me, as long as the details under low light are preserved., The only tradeoff here is a lack of bigger sensor and more importantly, a lack of stabilisation. Neither EIS nor OIS is present in the camera, which in means in certain situations, photos come out quite blurry unless taken with the phone mounted on a tripod. Example given below:, , , , , The Mi A2 can take some stellar portrait shots, keeping the subject of the frame in focus and blurring out the rest of the background.

The blurring looks very natural with light sources turning into bokehs. The edges of the subjects are uniformly highlighted and details enhanced. This is hands down one of the best execution of the portrait mode I’ve seen on a mid-range phone and can give a lot of expensive phones a run for their money., Check out all the image samples posted above in high resolution here., Overall, the camera on the Mi A2 is one of the biggest reasons to buy the phone. A lot many phones now offer a stock Android experience with commendable hardware, but few come close to the all-round consistency of the A2’s camera., Owing to its slim form-factor, the battery capacity automatically becomes a trade-off. The Xiaomi Mi A2 packs a 3010mAh battery which is a hair lesser than what the Mi A1 had. Yet, thanks to a similarly efficient processor and lightweight stock Android, the A2 easily manages to last a work day which typically begins around 10AM till 8PM in the night. After heavy usage during my coverage of ChinaJoy, I had to put it on charge around 6:30PM, which is when the battery hit the 10 percent mark. On PCMark’s Work 2.0 Battery Test, the Mi A2 lasted 5 hours 13 minutes, which is a reassuring score. The Honor Play, in comparison has around 800mAh more battery capacity and ekes out around 9 hours of screen time on PCMark. The major quip with the phone comes with a slow charger out of the box even though it supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4.0 standard. Using a Quick Charge certified charger easily tops up the battery in around an hour, which otherwise takes a good 30 minutes more., Bottomline, The Mi A2 has all the elements of success. A robust, functional design, a reliable display, lightweight UI augmented by a fast-performing chipset and a class-leading camera (especially in the low-light segment) makes the Xiaomi Mi A2 hard to pass over. It’s definitely pricier than its predecessor but for good reason. The improvements in the camera and performance is reason enough to upgrade if you are using the Xiaomi Mi A1. There are some niggles and compromises in the form of an ugly camera bump, thermal instability and app crashes, which might indicates there’s more work needed in optimising the stock Android interface with the hardware. The Mi A2 is also going to be the first Xiaomi device in years to priced around the 20k mark. The Mi 5 was the last to command that price. There was of course the Mi Mix 2, but that’s in a different price segment altogether. It would be interesting to see whether the Mi A2 manages to sell as fast as Xiaomi’s Redmi phones especially when the asking price this time is much higher. As for me, I would recommend the Mi A2 over Honor Play for its all-round smooth experience.  The Honor Play is the superior performer here and it looks more premium as well, but the stock Android experience is much more usable and customisable than Honor’s EMUI. Furthermore, the camera on the Mi A2 will be a definite hit with anyone even remotely into photography. The Mi A2 is also a more reasonable buy over the Nokia 7 Plus which has been ruling the upper mid-range segment in our review sheets for a while now, simply for the lesser price tag it comes with."
2240,,xiaomi-redmi-5-4gb-review-129001,0,0,2019-05-22,129001,Subhrojit Mallick,Xiaomi Redmi 5 4GB Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/xiaomi-redmi-5-4gb-review-129001.html,"The Redmi 5 is definitely one of the more powerful and power-efficient offerings in the budget segment but the novelty of the phone is marred by Xiaomi itself thanks to the more powerful Redmi Note 5 at around the same price. The base variant of the phone isn’t powerful enough to match the requirements of an average power user while the top variant is only Rs 1,000 less than the top variant of the Redmi Note 5. Independently, the Redmi 5 is a decent offering that seals Xiaomi’s grasp of the low-end smartphone segment. The company hopes to cushion itself with the Redmi 5 should the Redmi Note 5 be passed over for the more powerful Redmi Note 5 Pro. It also makes for more choices for the consumer, together with more confusion of course. The biggest deterrent to buying Xiaomi devices has been its flash-sale model, but Redmi 5 will be on an open sale on Amazon, putting that concern to rest., , Xiaomi’s Redmi lineup of phones have been notorious at making mid-range phones look like overpriced pieces of hardware. Ever since its launch in India, the Redmi series has brought mid-tier features down to the budget segment, giving other budget phone makers a run for their money. Noted for its superior build quality and a consistent set of well-loved features, the Redmi lineup is mostly the reason Xiaomi is enjoying the numero uno position in the Indian smartphone market., Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Enter the Xiaomi Redmi 5, the successor to the Redmi 4 which was one of the top-selling phones in India last year. The Redmi 5 came quickly after the launch of the mid-range Redmi Note 5 and the Redmi Note 5 Pro. With a price tag starting at Rs 7,999 and going all the way to Rs 10,999 the Redmi 5 is kind of a confusing product. The cheapest variant is difficult to recommend because of the barebones hardware while the top-most variant is competing head-to-head with the base variant of the Redmi Note 5., Confusing pricing aside, does the Redmi 5 tick all the boxes in the budget phone segment? More importantly, does it make sense to buy this over the Redmi Note 5? We find out., Design, , The Xiaomi Redmi 5 is a conscious move away from metal unibody designs. As seen on the Redmi Note 5, the Redmi 5 is also made out of plastic where a polycarbonate frame holds the display and the rear metal plate. The top and bottom are also made out of plastic which allows adequate signal reception. Despite that, Xiaomi has etched the antenna lines on the body, perhaps to retain the metal design philosophy of its predecessors. The camera is placed centrally at the back, with the LED flash and the fingerprint sensor right below. We received the black colour variant for review, which is the neutral choice to go for, but if you are looking to experiment, there’s a suave Lake Blue variant also on offer., The phone also happens to be the first Xiaomi phone under Rs 10,000 to sport the trendy 18:9 display aspect ratio. While this does make for modern looks, it doesn’t necessarily mean bezel-less. The Redmi 5 has a lot of spare space both on the top and bottom while the sides have a distinct black, but slim border around the display. Nevertheless, the curved corners makes the phone feel nice to hold and easy to grip. Down below are the speaker grilles symmetrically placed while on top, you get the 3.5mm headphone jack and the reliable IR blaster., There’s really nothing to complain about the build quality of the phone save for the fact that it still uses the older micro-USB port and a hybrid SIM slot. Micro-USB is on its way out and it would have been good to make the phone future-proof with a USB-Type C port. A hybrid SIM slot means you can either use a second nano-SIM or a microSD card to expand storage. In the budget segment where the buyer is looking to maximise the value for money, this crucial compromise could be a deal-breaker., Display, , The Redmi 5 keeps up with changing times with the in-vogue 18:9 display. It sport a 5.7-inch HD+ (720x1440 pixels) IPS LCD panel which looks decent considering the price it is offered at. The taller aspect ratio gives more screen real estate to work with, but it doesn’t necessarily make the phone compact, as it should be the case because of the extra bezels., , The 720p resolution makes for a decent 282ppi pixel density while the IPS LCD panel means the viewing angles are good enough. The display is just bright enough to feel pleasant when used indoors, but it’s not very legible under direct sunlight. Xiaomi does offer an Adaptive Display option which tweaks the colour temperature and contrast based on ambient light to maintain consistency, but its effectiveness is hit-or-miss at best. There’s also a Standard Mode that dials down the brightness but is more colour accurate., Performance and UI, , The Redmi 5 runs on the latest MIUI 9 interface based on Android 7.1.2 Nougat. Yes, Xiaomi is still using an older Android version but that doesn’t mean the launcher skips on new features. You do the get the expected split-screen support (no picture-in-picture mode though) and other Nougat-centric features. But apart from that, there are a lot of tiny, but important additions that make using MIUI a productivity-booster. I particularly like the OTP detection in SMSes and the ‘Second Space’ option that allows dual instances of apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger., , There’s also some added smartness to MIUI 9 — Smart replies, Smart app launcher, smart image search and the likes. Xiaomi also claims better RAM management which seems evident in the way the phone the never slacked when stressed., Having said that, MIUI is distinctly different from the stock Android experience. It’s closer to the iOS layout than Android’s. The apps are all dumped on the home screen and after a few months of use, it does feel cluttered. There’s a content space when you swipe left from the homescreen which houses the smart app launcher that presents relevant shortcuts based on your location and activity, a note-taker, and widgets for cricket scores, calendar, and the likes., What’s impressive is that despite a launcher that’s loaded with features, the hardware under the hood is tuned enough to make the phone function without much of a hitch. You get an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 chipset underneath which is akin to the architecture of the Snapdragon 625, having been built on the same 14nm manufacturing process. Even more impressive is the fact that Xiaomi has managed to introduce the chipset to a phone under Rs 10,000. Even though it was pitched as an entry-level chipset, the Snapdragon 450 powered the more expensive Vivo V7 and the V7+ last year.  The eight cortex A53 cores are clocked at a max clock speed of 1.8GHz which is commendable for a budget phone. The phone could handle the newly launched PlayersUnknown Battlefields with ease, albeit under low graphics settings, but there was hardly any lag and I even managed to get a ‘Chicken Dinner’ playing on it.,  ,  , Benchmark results will show the Redmi 5 is clearly faster than its predecessor as well as other Snapdragon 430-powered phones. It’s multi-core performance is almost as good as the Mi A1 which was one of the top performing phone last year.  , The Redmi 5 is offered in three RAM variants — 2GB, 3GB and 4GB. The unit we received had 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Ideally, this is the option we would recommend as the 2GB RAM and 16GB storage variant seems too underpowered to get any serious work done and the 3GB/32GB variant sits somewhere in between. Weirdly enough, the 3GB/32GB variant of the Redmi Note 5 retails for Rs 9,999, which is more feature-packed than the Redmi 5., Camera, , The Xiaomi Redmi 5 has almost the same camera hardware as the Redmi Note 5, which is a great thing for the budget segment. It is kind of expected as the Redmi Note 5 in India is the rebranded Redmi 5 Plus from China. Both sport a 12-megapixel rear shooter with f/2.2 aperture and 1.25um pixels and phase-detection AF., The camera on the Xiaomi Redmi 5 was disappointing to say the least. While every aspect of the phone has improved over its predecessor, the camera has lagged behind. The f/2.2 aperture results in darker shots with aggressive noise reduction. It isn’t really the worst we have seen on a budget phone, but knowing how Xiaomi likes to push the boundaries, the camera leaves a lot to be desired., Daylight, , Daytime shots are decent enough to be social-media worthy. They’re low on contrast and the colours aren’t at all accurat, but pleasant nonetheless. There’s also a slight shutter lag even when there’s enough light and HDR isn’t turned on by default. The HDR mode is commendable in scourging details from the shadows and if not for the longer shutter time, I would recommend using it all the time., Macro, , The camera is quite capable of taking macro shots which are detail rich. It does take some time to focus properly but when it does, you will be quite pleased with the results. There’s no bokeh mode and a small f/2.2 aperture hardly allows any background separation., Low-light, , Smaller aperture means less light and that almost sums up the phone’s low-light capability. Having said that, the camera algorithm does reduce some of the noise, but the overall result is disappointing. The camera fails to capture the details and contrast is hardly there., Front Camera, , You get a 5-megapixel front camera with in-built beauty modes and an LED flash. It takes decent selfies with high contrast and overexposed backgrounds. The LED flash doesn’t really add to the quality though. You are better off keeping it off., Battery, , While the older Redmi 4 came with a whopping 4,000mAh battery, Xiaomi has shaved off the battery capacity in the Redmi 5 by providing a 3,300mAh battery. The company hopes that the power-efficient chipset will offset the difference, which it does to some extent, but the battery life is less than its predecessor. Playing a graphically intensive game like PubG drains the battery faster but occasional social media  browsing, taking pictures and watching videos will easily last the phone over a day and then some more., Xiaomi doesn’t bundle a fast charger with the phone and it takes around 3 hours to charge the device to its full capacity., Bottomline, The Xiaomi Redmi 5 is a welcome offering, but a confusing one at the same. It seems like Xiaomi is hedging its bets should the Redmi Note 5 fail to make an impression in the face of its more powerful elder sibling. The Redmi 5 is well-built but fails to tick all the boxes for a phone under the budget segment. With a powerful, but entry-level processor, it does push the boundaries as far as raw performance is concerned, but leaves a lot to be desired in the camera segment."

The base variant of the phone isn’t powerful enough to match the requirements of an average power user while the top variant is only Rs 1,000 less than the top variant of the Redmi Note 5. Independently, the Redmi 5 is a decent offering that seals Xiaomi’s grasp of the low-end smartphone segment. The company hopes to cushion itself with the Redmi 5 should the Redmi Note 5 be passed over for the more powerful Redmi Note 5 Pro. It also makes for more choices for the consumer, together with more confusion of course. The biggest deterrent to buying Xiaomi devices has been its flash-sale model, but Redmi 5 will be on an open sale on Amazon, putting that concern to rest., , Xiaomi’s Redmi lineup of phones have been notorious at making mid-range phones look like overpriced pieces of hardware. Ever since its launch in India, the Redmi series has brought mid-tier features down to the budget segment, giving other budget phone makers a run for their money. Noted for its superior build quality and a consistent set of well-loved features, the Redmi lineup is mostly the reason Xiaomi is enjoying the numero uno position in the Indian smartphone market., Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Enter the Xiaomi Redmi 5, the successor to the Redmi 4 which was one of the top-selling phones in India last year. The Redmi 5 came quickly after the launch of the mid-range Redmi Note 5 and the Redmi Note 5 Pro. With a price tag starting at Rs 7,999 and going all the way to Rs 10,999 the Redmi 5 is kind of a confusing product. The cheapest variant is difficult to recommend because of the barebones hardware while the top-most variant is competing head-to-head with the base variant of the Redmi Note 5., Confusing pricing aside, does the Redmi 5 tick all the boxes in the budget phone segment? More importantly, does it make sense to buy this over the Redmi Note 5? We find out., Design, , The Xiaomi Redmi 5 is a conscious move away from metal unibody designs. As seen on the Redmi Note 5, the Redmi 5 is also made out of plastic where a polycarbonate frame holds the display and the rear metal plate. The top and bottom are also made out of plastic which allows adequate signal reception. Despite that, Xiaomi has etched the antenna lines on the body, perhaps to retain the metal design philosophy of its predecessors. The camera is placed centrally at the back, with the LED flash and the fingerprint sensor right below. We received the black colour variant for review, which is the neutral choice to go for, but if you are looking to experiment, there’s a suave Lake Blue variant also on offer., The phone also happens to be the first Xiaomi phone under Rs 10,000 to sport the trendy 18:9 display aspect ratio. While this does make for modern looks, it doesn’t necessarily mean bezel-less. The Redmi 5 has a lot of spare space both on the top and bottom while the sides have a distinct black, but slim border around the display. Nevertheless, the curved corners makes the phone feel nice to hold and easy to grip. Down below are the speaker grilles symmetrically placed while on top, you get the 3.5mm headphone jack and the reliable IR blaster., There’s really nothing to complain about the build quality of the phone save for the fact that it still uses the older micro-USB port and a hybrid SIM slot. Micro-USB is on its way out and it would have been good to make the phone future-proof with a USB-Type C port. A hybrid SIM slot means you can either use a second nano-SIM or a microSD card to expand storage. In the budget segment where the buyer is looking to maximise the value for money, this crucial compromise could be a deal-breaker., Display, , The Redmi 5 keeps up with changing times with the in-vogue 18:9 display.

Xiaomi does offer an Adaptive Display option which tweaks the colour temperature and contrast based on ambient light to maintain consistency, but its effectiveness is hit-or-miss at best. There’s also a Standard Mode that dials down the brightness but is more colour accurate., Performance and UI, , The Redmi 5 runs on the latest MIUI 9 interface based on Android 7.1.2 Nougat. Yes, Xiaomi is still using an older Android version but that doesn’t mean the launcher skips on new features. You do the get the expected split-screen support (no picture-in-picture mode though) and other Nougat-centric features. But apart from that, there are a lot of tiny, but important additions that make using MIUI a productivity-booster. I particularly like the OTP detection in SMSes and the ‘Second Space’ option that allows dual instances of apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger., , There’s also some added smartness to MIUI 9 — Smart replies, Smart app launcher, smart image search and the likes. Xiaomi also claims better RAM management which seems evident in the way the phone the never slacked when stressed., Having said that, MIUI is distinctly different from the stock Android experience. It’s closer to the iOS layout than Android’s. The apps are all dumped on the home screen and after a few months of use, it does feel cluttered. There’s a content space when you swipe left from the homescreen which houses the smart app launcher that presents relevant shortcuts based on your location and activity, a note-taker, and widgets for cricket scores, calendar, and the likes., What’s impressive is that despite a launcher that’s loaded with features, the hardware under the hood is tuned enough to make the phone function without much of a hitch. You get an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 chipset underneath which is akin to the architecture of the Snapdragon 625, having been built on the same 14nm manufacturing process. Even more impressive is the fact that Xiaomi has managed to introduce the chipset to a phone under Rs 10,000. Even though it was pitched as an entry-level chipset, the Snapdragon 450 powered the more expensive Vivo V7 and the V7+ last year.  The eight cortex A53 cores are clocked at a max clock speed of 1.8GHz which is commendable for a budget phone. The phone could handle the newly launched PlayersUnknown Battlefields with ease, albeit under low graphics settings, but there was hardly any lag and I even managed to get a ‘Chicken Dinner’ playing on it.,  ,  , Benchmark results will show the Redmi 5 is clearly faster than its predecessor as well as other Snapdragon 430-powered phones. It’s multi-core performance is almost as good as the Mi A1 which was one of the top performing phone last year.  , The Redmi 5 is offered in three RAM variants — 2GB, 3GB and 4GB. The unit we received had 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Ideally, this is the option we would recommend as the 2GB RAM and 16GB storage variant seems too underpowered to get any serious work done and the 3GB/32GB variant sits somewhere in between. Weirdly enough, the 3GB/32GB variant of the Redmi Note 5 retails for Rs 9,999, which is more feature-packed than the Redmi 5., Camera, , The Xiaomi Redmi 5 has almost the same camera hardware as the Redmi Note 5, which is a great thing for the budget segment. It is kind of expected as the Redmi Note 5 in India is the rebranded Redmi 5 Plus from China. Both sport a 12-megapixel rear shooter with f/2.2 aperture and 1.25um pixels and phase-detection AF., The camera on the Xiaomi Redmi 5 was disappointing to say the least. While every aspect of the phone has improved over its predecessor, the camera has lagged behind. The f/2.2 aperture results in darker shots with aggressive noise reduction. It isn’t really the worst we have seen on a budget phone, but knowing how Xiaomi likes to push the boundaries, the camera leaves a lot to be desired., Daylight, , Daytime shots are decent enough to be social-media worthy. They’re low on contrast and the colours aren’t at all accurat, but pleasant nonetheless. There’s also a slight shutter lag even when there’s enough light and HDR isn’t turned on by default. The HDR mode is commendable in scourging details from the shadows and if not for the longer shutter time, I would recommend using it all the time., Macro, , The camera is quite capable of taking macro shots which are detail rich. It does take some time to focus properly but when it does, you will be quite pleased with the results. There’s no bokeh mode and a small f/2.2 aperture hardly allows any background separation., Low-light, , Smaller aperture means less light and that almost sums up the phone’s low-light capability. Having said that, the camera algorithm does reduce some of the noise, but the overall result is disappointing. The camera fails to capture the details and contrast is hardly there., Front Camera, , You get a 5-megapixel front camera with in-built beauty modes and an LED flash. It takes decent selfies with high contrast and overexposed backgrounds. The LED flash doesn’t really add to the quality though. You are better off keeping it off., Battery, , While the older Redmi 4 came with a whopping 4,000mAh battery, Xiaomi has shaved off the battery capacity in the Redmi 5 by providing a 3,300mAh battery. The company hopes that the power-efficient chipset will offset the difference, which it does to some extent, but the battery life is less than its predecessor. Playing a graphically intensive game like PubG drains the battery faster but occasional social media  browsing, taking pictures and watching videos will easily last the phone over a day and then some more., Xiaomi doesn’t bundle a fast charger with the phone and it takes around 3 hours to charge the device to its full capacity., Bottomline, The Xiaomi Redmi 5 is a welcome offering, but a confusing one at the same. It seems like Xiaomi is hedging its bets should the Redmi Note 5 fail to make an impression in the face of its more powerful elder sibling. The Redmi 5 is well-built but fails to tick all the boxes for a phone under the budget segment. With a powerful, but entry-level processor, it does push the boundaries as far as raw performance is concerned, but leaves a lot to be desired in the camera segment."

The base variant of the phone isn’t powerful enough to match the requirements of an average power user while the top variant is only Rs 1,000 less than the top variant of the Redmi Note 5. Independently, the Redmi 5 is a decent offering that seals Xiaomi’s grasp of the low-end smartphone segment. The company hopes to cushion itself with the Redmi 5 should the Redmi Note 5 be passed over for the more powerful Redmi Note 5 Pro. It also makes for more choices for the consumer, together with more confusion of course. The biggest deterrent to buying Xiaomi devices has been its flash-sale model, but Redmi 5 will be on an open sale on Amazon, putting that concern to rest., , Xiaomi’s Redmi lineup of phones have been notorious at making mid-range phones look like overpriced pieces of hardware. Ever since its launch in India, the Redmi series has brought mid-tier features down to the budget segment, giving other budget phone makers a run for their money. Noted for its superior build quality and a consistent set of well-loved features, the Redmi lineup is mostly the reason Xiaomi is enjoying the numero uno position in the Indian smartphone market., Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Enter the Xiaomi Redmi 5, the successor to the Redmi 4 which was one of the top-selling phones in India last year. The Redmi 5 came quickly after the launch of the mid-range Redmi Note 5 and the Redmi Note 5 Pro. With a price tag starting at Rs 7,999 and going all the way to Rs 10,999 the Redmi 5 is kind of a confusing product. The cheapest variant is difficult to recommend because of the barebones hardware while the top-most variant is competing head-to-head with the base variant of the Redmi Note 5., Confusing pricing aside, does the Redmi 5 tick all the boxes in the budget phone segment? More importantly, does it make sense to buy this over the Redmi Note 5? We find out., Design, , The Xiaomi Redmi 5 is a conscious move away from metal unibody designs. As seen on the Redmi Note 5, the Redmi 5 is also made out of plastic where a polycarbonate frame holds the display and the rear metal plate. The top and bottom are also made out of plastic which allows adequate signal reception. Despite that, Xiaomi has etched the antenna lines on the body, perhaps to retain the metal design philosophy of its predecessors. The camera is placed centrally at the back, with the LED flash and the fingerprint sensor right below. We received the black colour variant for review, which is the neutral choice to go for, but if you are looking to experiment, there’s a suave Lake Blue variant also on offer., The phone also happens to be the first Xiaomi phone under Rs 10,000 to sport the trendy 18:9 display aspect ratio. While this does make for modern looks, it doesn’t necessarily mean bezel-less. The Redmi 5 has a lot of spare space both on the top and bottom while the sides have a distinct black, but slim border around the display. Nevertheless, the curved corners makes the phone feel nice to hold and easy to grip. Down below are the speaker grilles symmetrically placed while on top, you get the 3.5mm headphone jack and the reliable IR blaster., There’s really nothing to complain about the build quality of the phone save for the fact that it still uses the older micro-USB port and a hybrid SIM slot. Micro-USB is on its way out and it would have been good to make the phone future-proof with a USB-Type C port. A hybrid SIM slot means you can either use a second nano-SIM or a microSD card to expand storage. In the budget segment where the buyer is looking to maximise the value for money, this crucial compromise could be a deal-breaker., Display, , The Redmi 5 keeps up with changing times with the in-vogue 18:9 display. It sport a 5.7-inch HD+ (720x1440 pixels) IPS LCD panel which looks decent considering the price it is offered at.

There’s also a Standard Mode that dials down the brightness but is more colour accurate., Performance and UI, , The Redmi 5 runs on the latest MIUI 9 interface based on Android 7.1.2 Nougat. Yes, Xiaomi is still using an older Android version but that doesn’t mean the launcher skips on new features. You do the get the expected split-screen support (no picture-in-picture mode though) and other Nougat-centric features. But apart from that, there are a lot of tiny, but important additions that make using MIUI a productivity-booster. I particularly like the OTP detection in SMSes and the ‘Second Space’ option that allows dual instances of apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger., , There’s also some added smartness to MIUI 9 — Smart replies, Smart app launcher, smart image search and the likes. Xiaomi also claims better RAM management which seems evident in the way the phone the never slacked when stressed., Having said that, MIUI is distinctly different from the stock Android experience. It’s closer to the iOS layout than Android’s. The apps are all dumped on the home screen and after a few months of use, it does feel cluttered. There’s a content space when you swipe left from the homescreen which houses the smart app launcher that presents relevant shortcuts based on your location and activity, a note-taker, and widgets for cricket scores, calendar, and the likes., What’s impressive is that despite a launcher that’s loaded with features, the hardware under the hood is tuned enough to make the phone function without much of a hitch. You get an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 chipset underneath which is akin to the architecture of the Snapdragon 625, having been built on the same 14nm manufacturing process. Even more impressive is the fact that Xiaomi has managed to introduce the chipset to a phone under Rs 10,000. Even though it was pitched as an entry-level chipset, the Snapdragon 450 powered the more expensive Vivo V7 and the V7+ last year.  The eight cortex A53 cores are clocked at a max clock speed of 1.8GHz which is commendable for a budget phone. The phone could handle the newly launched PlayersUnknown Battlefields with ease, albeit under low graphics settings, but there was hardly any lag and I even managed to get a ‘Chicken Dinner’ playing on it.,  ,  , Benchmark results will show the Redmi 5 is clearly faster than its predecessor as well as other Snapdragon 430-powered phones. It’s multi-core performance is almost as good as the Mi A1 which was one of the top performing phone last year.  , The Redmi 5 is offered in three RAM variants — 2GB, 3GB and 4GB. The unit we received had 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Ideally, this is the option we would recommend as the 2GB RAM and 16GB storage variant seems too underpowered to get any serious work done and the 3GB/32GB variant sits somewhere in between. Weirdly enough, the 3GB/32GB variant of the Redmi Note 5 retails for Rs 9,999, which is more feature-packed than the Redmi 5., Camera, , The Xiaomi Redmi 5 has almost the same camera hardware as the Redmi Note 5, which is a great thing for the budget segment. It is kind of expected as the Redmi Note 5 in India is the rebranded Redmi 5 Plus from China. Both sport a 12-megapixel rear shooter with f/2.2 aperture and 1.25um pixels and phase-detection AF., The camera on the Xiaomi Redmi 5 was disappointing to say the least. While every aspect of the phone has improved over its predecessor, the camera has lagged behind. The f/2.2 aperture results in darker shots with aggressive noise reduction. It isn’t really the worst we have seen on a budget phone, but knowing how Xiaomi likes to push the boundaries, the camera leaves a lot to be desired., Daylight, , Daytime shots are decent enough to be social-media worthy. They’re low on contrast and the colours aren’t at all accurat, but pleasant nonetheless. There’s also a slight shutter lag even when there’s enough light and HDR isn’t turned on by default. The HDR mode is commendable in scourging details from the shadows and if not for the longer shutter time, I would recommend using it all the time., Macro, , The camera is quite capable of taking macro shots which are detail rich. It does take some time to focus properly but when it does, you will be quite pleased with the results. There’s no bokeh mode and a small f/2.2 aperture hardly allows any background separation., Low-light, , Smaller aperture means less light and that almost sums up the phone’s low-light capability. Having said that, the camera algorithm does reduce some of the noise, but the overall result is disappointing. The camera fails to capture the details and contrast is hardly there., Front Camera, , You get a 5-megapixel front camera with in-built beauty modes and an LED flash. It takes decent selfies with high contrast and overexposed backgrounds. The LED flash doesn’t really add to the quality though. You are better off keeping it off., Battery, , While the older Redmi 4 came with a whopping 4,000mAh battery, Xiaomi has shaved off the battery capacity in the Redmi 5 by providing a 3,300mAh battery. The company hopes that the power-efficient chipset will offset the difference, which it does to some extent, but the battery life is less than its predecessor. Playing a graphically intensive game like PubG drains the battery faster but occasional social media  browsing, taking pictures and watching videos will easily last the phone over a day and then some more., Xiaomi doesn’t bundle a fast charger with the phone and it takes around 3 hours to charge the device to its full capacity., Bottomline, The Xiaomi Redmi 5 is a welcome offering, but a confusing one at the same. It seems like Xiaomi is hedging its bets should the Redmi Note 5 fail to make an impression in the face of its more powerful elder sibling. The Redmi 5 is well-built but fails to tick all the boxes for a phone under the budget segment. With a powerful, but entry-level processor, it does push the boundaries as far as raw performance is concerned, but leaves a lot to be desired in the camera segment."

The base variant of the phone isn’t powerful enough to match the requirements of an average power user while the top variant is only Rs 1,000 less than the top variant of the Redmi Note 5. Independently, the Redmi 5 is a decent offering that seals Xiaomi’s grasp of the low-end smartphone segment. The company hopes to cushion itself with the Redmi 5 should the Redmi Note 5 be passed over for the more powerful Redmi Note 5 Pro. It also makes for more choices for the consumer, together with more confusion of course. The biggest deterrent to buying Xiaomi devices has been its flash-sale model, but Redmi 5 will be on an open sale on Amazon, putting that concern to rest., , Xiaomi’s Redmi lineup of phones have been notorious at making mid-range phones look like overpriced pieces of hardware. Ever since its launch in India, the Redmi series has brought mid-tier features down to the budget segment, giving other budget phone makers a run for their money.

The Redmi 5 came quickly after the launch of the mid-range Redmi Note 5 and the Redmi Note 5 Pro. With a price tag starting at Rs 7,999 and going all the way to Rs 10,999 the Redmi 5 is kind of a confusing product. The cheapest variant is difficult to recommend because of the barebones hardware while the top-most variant is competing head-to-head with the base variant of the Redmi Note 5., Confusing pricing aside, does the Redmi 5 tick all the boxes in the budget phone segment? More importantly, does it make sense to buy this over the Redmi Note 5? We find out., Design, , The Xiaomi Redmi 5 is a conscious move away from metal unibody designs. As seen on the Redmi Note 5, the Redmi 5 is also made out of plastic where a polycarbonate frame holds the display and the rear metal plate. The top and bottom are also made out of plastic which allows adequate signal reception. Despite that, Xiaomi has etched the antenna lines on the body, perhaps to retain the metal design philosophy of its predecessors. The camera is placed centrally at the back, with the LED flash and the fingerprint sensor right below.

While this does make for modern looks, it doesn’t necessarily mean bezel-less. The Redmi 5 has a lot of spare space both on the top and bottom while the sides have a distinct black, but slim border around the display. Nevertheless, the curved corners makes the phone feel nice to hold and easy to grip. Down below are the speaker grilles symmetrically placed while on top, you get the 3.5mm headphone jack and the reliable IR blaster., There’s really nothing to complain about the build quality of the phone save for the fact that it still uses the older micro-USB port and a hybrid SIM slot. Micro-USB is on its way out and it would have been good to make the phone future-proof with a USB-Type C port. A hybrid SIM slot means you can either use a second nano-SIM or a microSD card to expand storage. In the budget segment where the buyer is looking to maximise the value for money, this crucial compromise could be a deal-breaker., Display, , The Redmi 5 keeps up with changing times with the in-vogue 18:9 display. It sport a 5.7-inch HD+ (720x1440 pixels) IPS LCD panel which looks decent considering the price it is offered at. The taller aspect ratio gives more screen real estate to work with, but it doesn’t necessarily make the phone compact, as it should be the case because of the extra bezels., , The 720p resolution makes for a decent 282ppi pixel density while the IPS LCD panel means the viewing angles are good enough.

2235,,xiaomi-redmi-5-note-pro-review-126065,0,0,2019-05-22,126065,Hardik Singh,Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/xiaomi-redmi-5-note-pro-review-126065.html,"The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro is currently the best smartphone you can buy in the sub 15K segment. It offers excellent performance, has a two-day battery life, both front and rear cameras are good and it has a sturdy build quality., , In just a few years Xiaomi has outshined most of its competition in the budget segment. While the older Redmi phones were good, the tides turned in 2016 with the launch of the Redmi Note 3, which was a superb phone in all regards. It won our best phone under the budget category award for the year and last year, the award was claimed by the Redmi Note 4. You can see a trend here, the phones were just that good. Hence, the new Redmi Note 5 Pro has a lot to live up to. Yes, there is the Redmi Note 5 as well, but this is the phone which is the true successor to last year’s Redmi Note 4. , Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, , The new phone brings a dual camera and the Univisium display to the Redmi line, which thanks to Honor and many others, have become the norm in the category. However, that was more or less expected from a phone launching in 2018. That said, according to us, the newest aspect of the device is the chip that powers it. The Snapdragon 636 is not just a new chip, the Note 5 Pro is the first phone to bring it to India and combined with 4000mAh battery (again), Xiaomi might just have a winner at its hands., Build and Design: New Design, same approach
With the Redmi Note 4 we had a small complaint about the width of the phone and with the Note 5 and the Note 5 Pro, that has been resolved. Xiaomi’s solution is to provide a taller 18:9 aspect ratio display. The taller 5.99-inch 2160 x 1080p display is still not the best size for a comfortable fit, even though the width is now lesser than Its predecessor. That said, it is definitely an improvement over the last phone. The display has rounded corners and thinner bezels, which add to the whole design appeal. The curved back does make the phone easier to grip, but at the same time, it feels heavy and does take some time getting used to. There is no improvement as such in terms of materials used and unlike the Moto G5s Plus or the Mi A1, the Redmi Note 5 still doesn't have a metal unibody. It still has plastic inserts on both the top and bottom of the metal back to incorporate the antennas., , The dual cameras at the rear also come with a rather pronounced camera bump, which means the phone rocks everytime you tap on the display if it’s on a flat surface. Ideally, the rather large dual camera module at the rear should have been sitting flush with the body and not jutting out. All that said, the Redmi series was never really about the looks. Over the years, it has maintained its utilitarian and accessible approach towards design and build quality, and this new variant is no different., , Display and UI: Nothing to complain about, except Oreo
Things get a little exciting as on this 18:9 display, the newer MIUI 9 feels at home. The 5.99-inch display here is just as good as we have come to see on Xiaomi devices. Xiaomi is still using an IPS LCD panel on the phone which has good viewing angles and good colour reproduction. The colour fidelity is not perfect, by default, the display is calibrated to push out slightly warmer tones, which looks quite pleasing to view in day-to-day use. We have no complaints about the touch response but, Xiaomi doesn’t specify whether the Redmi Note 5 Pro has Gorilla Glass on top for that added safety. One could guess that it has some kind of toughened glass but not the latest gorilla glass protection., , MIUI looks just as colourful as it has been over the years. The first thing we should mention that you are not getting Android Oreo out of the box. This is somewhat disappointing as Oreo is the latest version of the OS and brings not just added security but support for Contextual press-to-hold options, Adaptive icons, bundled notifications, better notifications controls, background app management, faster and better support for applications. Moreover, a recent poll done by Xiaomi itself suggest that customers not only prefer the latest Android, but the stock version of Android over MIUI. However, that poll was that taken down by the company., , On the Note 5 Pro, MIUI9 carries forward it's no app drawer approach and tries to offer some added features such as dual apps and second space. With dual apps, one can run separate accounts of the same service/app and the second space functionality provides separate user experiences for example for work and home. Both are available in the settings menu. Besides that, you get some pre-loaded apps such as Microsoft apps, Facebook, Amazon, Myntra and Amazon Prime Videos app. You still get the added tools (calculator, clock, file manager, etc) and Xiaomi also has its own app store on-board which seems completely unnecessary since Google Play store is already here. , The UI also seems to be optimised towards offering better battery life out of the box and keeps the brightness always a little lower than required. It works and we are happy for that, more on that later., Performance: Pushing the envelope even further
The main feature as we mentioned earlier seems to be the new chip on the phone aka Qualcomm Snapdragon 636. Xiaomi told us that it is the “spiritual successor” to the Redmi Note 3, which got rave reviews thanks to the Snapdragon 650, which back in 2016 blew every other phone out of the water. Xiaomi wants to relive that success story and says that the company has been closely listening to its Mi fans and thus we have this phone. Manufactured on a 14nm process the SD636 uses eight Kryo 260 cores clocked at 1.8GHz and is more similar to the Snapdragon 660 which uses the same Kryo 260 core clocked at 2.2GHz. Qualcomm claims that the Kryo 260 allows for 40% better performance than the Snapdragon 630 powered by eight ARM A53 cores. Along with an Adreno 509 GPU, the Redmi Note 5 Pro just blazes past every other phone at the same price point in synthetic benchmarks. , , The story is pretty similar in day-to-day tasks and we saw the phone outperform each and every budget phone we have tested at the same price bracket (currently available). Be it the loading times in Injustice 2, opening multiple apps or just switching between multiple heavy apps and games. We even opened all available apps on the phone which were more than 50 and even that couldn't bring the phone to a halt. However, during our use, the system always ran a little heavy with 600MB - 800MB free out of the 4GB of available RAM. The phone never felt slower in comparison to its rivals. When taxed to its limits, the Redmi Note 5 Pro does occasionally show signs of lag. Though the lag will only be perceivable if you have used a flagship class phone prior (for instance, OnePlus 5). Otherwise, you will be happy with the performance., The other good thing we observed that the phone hardly gets warm after playing on the phone for an hour straight. Xiaomi says that the phone has a single pyrolytic graphite sheet which decreases the temperature by 1-degree celsius. The audio quality with the equalizer enabled is as good as any other phone under 25K and we have no issues with the quality and reception of calls., , Battery life: Still runs for two days straight
As we mentioned earlier, the UI on the device has a tendency to lower brightness slightly more than required and is more optimized to save battery life. That combined with a 4000mAh battery and a power efficient SoC means that you get up to two days of battery life out of this phone quite easily. The battery just won’t die in a day. We tried draining the battery with multiple apps in the background and playing Injustice 2 with headphones on and after two hours gaming, the battery went down by just 20% percent. If you haven't calculated that yet, that is almost 9-10 hours of heavy gaming. Streaming videos on the larger display is a joy and the battery life will easily move into double digits, even if you are watching everything in full brightness. We liked the battery life on the Redmi Note 4 and with that big bump in performance, we are loving the battery life on the Note 5 Pro., Camera: The new best
It seems like Xiaomi has been not just listening to its Mi fans, but had an ear open to the feedback most of us reviewers provided last year about the camera. The new dual camera setup, though looks inspired offers much better results than its predecessors. You have a 12MP primary camera (Sony IMX486) with a sensor size of 1.25um and an aperture of f/2.2. The secondary 5MP camera is used for depth sensing only and has a sensor size of 1.12um with f/2.0 aperture., , , , In ample lighting conditions, the camera captures a good amount of details and has a punchy colour reproduction. The colour reproduction is a little exaggerated, but it's not too far off and at the end of the day will looks pleasing to the normal user. Low light image capabilities are equally good and the camera has good dynamic range. The images captured in low light conditions, retain details quite well and keep the colours in check. If you ask us, this is as good a camera as the Mi A1 and in some areas even beats the Mi A1. For reference, Xiaomi Mi A1 has been our top rated camera in the 15K segment., , , , The secondary camera at the back does not offer optical zoom, the main purpose is depth sensing. That said, it does help in the image quality and offering better subject separation. From all the images we have taken so far, the portrait images look better than most of its competitors. They carry plenty of details and the background blur is also quite good for the price. We also liked the fact that there is no beautify settings in the portrait mode, which means you will be getting natural looking portraits., , , Compared to the camera quality, the video mode on the phone is rather disappointing. First, the video is cropped down to 8.3MP to produce a 1080p video, which is the max resolution the phone can shoot in and then the quality of the video is not great. Also, the phone cannot shoot in more than 30fps, even though the SD636 is capable of shooting up to 4K UltraHD capture @ 30fps and 1080p videos can shot @120fps, At the front, the phone features a 20MP IMX376 sensor which takes good images in all kinds of lighting conditions. There is a front-facing flash as well, which does blind you when you take the image, but the images do not look as burnt out as such. You also get software based portrait image, which lets you take that ‘Bokeh’ image with background blur and is decent at best, but not as good as the one you will get from the rear camera.,  , Bottomline
The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro is quite simply the new king in its segment. It offers the sought after combination of performance (speed) and brilliant battery life. The display is good and both the rear and front cameras leave little room for any complaints. We just feel Xiaomi should have launched the phone with Android 8.0 out of the box and with USB Type-C. Xiaomi claims to be the number 1 smartphone brand in the country and has the ability to set the standard higher, so why not walk the talk?, That said, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro comes out as a winner and sets the benchmark for all mid-tier smartphones coming out this year. It is quite simply the best phone you can buy today at its price."
2235,,xiaomi-redmi-5-note-pro-review-126065,0,0,2019-05-22,126065,Hardik Singh,Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/xiaomi-redmi-5-note-pro-review-126065.html,"The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro is currently the best smartphone you can buy in the sub 15K segment. It offers excellent performance, has a two-day battery life, both front and rear cameras are good and it has a sturdy build quality., , In just a few years Xiaomi has outshined most of its competition in the budget segment. While the older Redmi phones were good, the tides turned in 2016 with the launch of the Redmi Note 3, which was a superb phone in all regards. It won our best phone under the budget category award for the year and last year, the award was claimed by the Redmi Note 4. You can see a trend here, the phones were just that good. Hence, the new Redmi Note 5 Pro has a lot to live up to. Yes, there is the Redmi Note 5 as well, but this is the phone which is the true successor to last year’s Redmi Note 4. , Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, , The new phone brings a dual camera and the Univisium display to the Redmi line, which thanks to Honor and many others, have become the norm in the category. However, that was more or less expected from a phone launching in 2018. That said, according to us, the newest aspect of the device is the chip that powers it. The Snapdragon 636 is not just a new chip, the Note 5 Pro is the first phone to bring it to India and combined with 4000mAh battery (again), Xiaomi might just have a winner at its hands., Build and Design: New Design, same approach
With the Redmi Note 4 we had a small complaint about the width of the phone and with the Note 5 and the Note 5 Pro, that has been resolved. Xiaomi’s solution is to provide a taller 18:9 aspect ratio display. The taller 5.99-inch 2160 x 1080p display is still not the best size for a comfortable fit, even though the width is now lesser than Its predecessor. That said, it is definitely an improvement over the last phone. The display has rounded corners and thinner bezels, which add to the whole design appeal. The curved back does make the phone easier to grip, but at the same time, it feels heavy and does take some time getting used to. There is no improvement as such in terms of materials used and unlike the Moto G5s Plus or the Mi A1, the Redmi Note 5 still doesn't have a metal unibody. It still has plastic inserts on both the top and bottom of the metal back to incorporate the antennas., , The dual cameras at the rear also come with a rather pronounced camera bump, which means the phone rocks everytime you tap on the display if it’s on a flat surface. Ideally, the rather large dual camera module at the rear should have been sitting flush with the body and not jutting out. All that said, the Redmi series was never really about the looks. Over the years, it has maintained its utilitarian and accessible approach towards design and build quality, and this new variant is no different., , Display and UI: Nothing to complain about, except Oreo
Things get a little exciting as on this 18:9 display, the newer MIUI 9 feels at home. The 5.99-inch display here is just as good as we have come to see on Xiaomi devices. Xiaomi is still using an IPS LCD panel on the phone which has good viewing angles and good colour reproduction. The colour fidelity is not perfect, by default, the display is calibrated to push out slightly warmer tones, which looks quite pleasing to view in day-to-day use. We have no complaints about the touch response but, Xiaomi doesn’t specify whether the Redmi Note 5 Pro has Gorilla Glass on top for that added safety. One could guess that it has some kind of toughened glass but not the latest gorilla glass protection., , MIUI looks just as colourful as it has been over the years. The first thing we should mention that you are not getting Android Oreo out of the box. This is somewhat disappointing as Oreo is the latest version of the OS and brings not just added security but support for Contextual press-to-hold options, Adaptive icons, bundled notifications, better notifications controls, background app management, faster and better support for applications. Moreover, a recent poll done by Xiaomi itself suggest that customers not only prefer the latest Android, but the stock version of Android over MIUI. However, that poll was that taken down by the company., , On the Note 5 Pro, MIUI9 carries forward it's no app drawer approach and tries to offer some added features such as dual apps and second space. With dual apps, one can run separate accounts of the same service/app and the second space functionality provides separate user experiences for example for work and home. Both are available in the settings menu. Besides that, you get some pre-loaded apps such as Microsoft apps, Facebook, Amazon, Myntra and Amazon Prime Videos app. You still get the added tools (calculator, clock, file manager, etc) and Xiaomi also has its own app store on-board which seems completely unnecessary since Google Play store is already here. , The UI also seems to be optimised towards offering better battery life out of the box and keeps the brightness always a little lower than required.

It still has plastic inserts on both the top and bottom of the metal back to incorporate the antennas., , The dual cameras at the rear also come with a rather pronounced camera bump, which means the phone rocks everytime you tap on the display if it’s on a flat surface. Ideally, the rather large dual camera module at the rear should have been sitting flush with the body and not jutting out. All that said, the Redmi series was never really about the looks. Over the years, it has maintained its utilitarian and accessible approach towards design and build quality, and this new variant is no different., , Display and UI: Nothing to complain about, except Oreo
Things get a little exciting as on this 18:9 display, the newer MIUI 9 feels at home. The 5.99-inch display here is just as good as we have come to see on Xiaomi devices. Xiaomi is still using an IPS LCD panel on the phone which has good viewing angles and good colour reproduction. The colour fidelity is not perfect, by default, the display is calibrated to push out slightly warmer tones, which looks quite pleasing to view in day-to-day use. We have no complaints about the touch response but, Xiaomi doesn’t specify whether the Redmi Note 5 Pro has Gorilla Glass on top for that added safety. One could guess that it has some kind of toughened glass but not the latest gorilla glass protection., , MIUI looks just as colourful as it has been over the years. The first thing we should mention that you are not getting Android Oreo out of the box. This is somewhat disappointing as Oreo is the latest version of the OS and brings not just added security but support for Contextual press-to-hold options, Adaptive icons, bundled notifications, better notifications controls, background app management, faster and better support for applications. Moreover, a recent poll done by Xiaomi itself suggest that customers not only prefer the latest Android, but the stock version of Android over MIUI. However, that poll was that taken down by the company., , On the Note 5 Pro, MIUI9 carries forward it's no app drawer approach and tries to offer some added features such as dual apps and second space. With dual apps, one can run separate accounts of the same service/app and the second space functionality provides separate user experiences for example for work and home. Both are available in the settings menu. Besides that, you get some pre-loaded apps such as Microsoft apps, Facebook, Amazon, Myntra and Amazon Prime Videos app. You still get the added tools (calculator, clock, file manager, etc) and Xiaomi also has its own app store on-board which seems completely unnecessary since Google Play store is already here. , The UI also seems to be optimised towards offering better battery life out of the box and keeps the brightness always a little lower than required. It works and we are happy for that, more on that later., Performance: Pushing the envelope even further
The main feature as we mentioned earlier seems to be the new chip on the phone aka Qualcomm Snapdragon 636. Xiaomi told us that it is the “spiritual successor” to the Redmi Note 3, which got rave reviews thanks to the Snapdragon 650, which back in 2016 blew every other phone out of the water. Xiaomi wants to relive that success story and says that the company has been closely listening to its Mi fans and thus we have this phone. Manufactured on a 14nm process the SD636 uses eight Kryo 260 cores clocked at 1.8GHz and is more similar to the Snapdragon 660 which uses the same Kryo 260 core clocked at 2.2GHz. Qualcomm claims that the Kryo 260 allows for 40% better performance than the Snapdragon 630 powered by eight ARM A53 cores. Along with an Adreno 509 GPU, the Redmi Note 5 Pro just blazes past every other phone at the same price point in synthetic benchmarks. , , The story is pretty similar in day-to-day tasks and we saw the phone outperform each and every budget phone we have tested at the same price bracket (currently available). Be it the loading times in Injustice 2, opening multiple apps or just switching between multiple heavy apps and games. We even opened all available apps on the phone which were more than 50 and even that couldn't bring the phone to a halt. However, during our use, the system always ran a little heavy with 600MB - 800MB free out of the 4GB of available RAM. The phone never felt slower in comparison to its rivals. When taxed to its limits, the Redmi Note 5 Pro does occasionally show signs of lag. Though the lag will only be perceivable if you have used a flagship class phone prior (for instance, OnePlus 5). Otherwise, you will be happy with the performance., The other good thing we observed that the phone hardly gets warm after playing on the phone for an hour straight. Xiaomi says that the phone has a single pyrolytic graphite sheet which decreases the temperature by 1-degree celsius. The audio quality with the equalizer enabled is as good as any other phone under 25K and we have no issues with the quality and reception of calls., , Battery life: Still runs for two days straight
As we mentioned earlier, the UI on the device has a tendency to lower brightness slightly more than required and is more optimized to save battery life. That combined with a 4000mAh battery and a power efficient SoC means that you get up to two days of battery life out of this phone quite easily. The battery just won’t die in a day. We tried draining the battery with multiple apps in the background and playing Injustice 2 with headphones on and after two hours gaming, the battery went down by just 20% percent. If you haven't calculated that yet, that is almost 9-10 hours of heavy gaming. Streaming videos on the larger display is a joy and the battery life will easily move into double digits, even if you are watching everything in full brightness. We liked the battery life on the Redmi Note 4 and with that big bump in performance, we are loving the battery life on the Note 5 Pro., Camera: The new best
It seems like Xiaomi has been not just listening to its Mi fans, but had an ear open to the feedback most of us reviewers provided last year about the camera. The new dual camera setup, though looks inspired offers much better results than its predecessors. You have a 12MP primary camera (Sony IMX486) with a sensor size of 1.25um and an aperture of f/2.2. The secondary 5MP camera is used for depth sensing only and has a sensor size of 1.12um with f/2.0 aperture., , , , In ample lighting conditions, the camera captures a good amount of details and has a punchy colour reproduction. The colour reproduction is a little exaggerated, but it's not too far off and at the end of the day will looks pleasing to the normal user. Low light image capabilities are equally good and the camera has good dynamic range. The images captured in low light conditions, retain details quite well and keep the colours in check. If you ask us, this is as good a camera as the Mi A1 and in some areas even beats the Mi A1. For reference, Xiaomi Mi A1 has been our top rated camera in the 15K segment., , , , The secondary camera at the back does not offer optical zoom, the main purpose is depth sensing. That said, it does help in the image quality and offering better subject separation. From all the images we have taken so far, the portrait images look better than most of its competitors. They carry plenty of details and the background blur is also quite good for the price. We also liked the fact that there is no beautify settings in the portrait mode, which means you will be getting natural looking portraits., , , Compared to the camera quality, the video mode on the phone is rather disappointing. First, the video is cropped down to 8.3MP to produce a 1080p video, which is the max resolution the phone can shoot in and then the quality of the video is not great. Also, the phone cannot shoot in more than 30fps, even though the SD636 is capable of shooting up to 4K UltraHD capture @ 30fps and 1080p videos can shot @120fps, At the front, the phone features a 20MP IMX376 sensor which takes good images in all kinds of lighting conditions. There is a front-facing flash as well, which does blind you when you take the image, but the images do not look as burnt out as such. You also get software based portrait image, which lets you take that ‘Bokeh’ image with background blur and is decent at best, but not as good as the one you will get from the rear camera.,  , Bottomline
The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro is quite simply the new king in its segment. It offers the sought after combination of performance (speed) and brilliant battery life. The display is good and both the rear and front cameras leave little room for any complaints. We just feel Xiaomi should have launched the phone with Android 8.0 out of the box and with USB Type-C. Xiaomi claims to be the number 1 smartphone brand in the country and has the ability to set the standard higher, so why not walk the talk?, That said, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro comes out as a winner and sets the benchmark for all mid-tier smartphones coming out this year. It is quite simply the best phone you can buy today at its price."

It offers excellent performance, has a two-day battery life, both front and rear cameras are good and it has a sturdy build quality., , In just a few years Xiaomi has outshined most of its competition in the budget segment. While the older Redmi phones were good, the tides turned in 2016 with the launch of the Redmi Note 3, which was a superb phone in all regards. It won our best phone under the budget category award for the year and last year, the award was claimed by the Redmi Note 4. You can see a trend here, the phones were just that good. Hence, the new Redmi Note 5 Pro has a lot to live up to. Yes, there is the Redmi Note 5 as well, but this is the phone which is the true successor to last year’s Redmi Note 4. , Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, , The new phone brings a dual camera and the Univisium display to the Redmi line, which thanks to Honor and many others, have become the norm in the category. However, that was more or less expected from a phone launching in 2018. That said, according to us, the newest aspect of the device is the chip that powers it. The Snapdragon 636 is not just a new chip, the Note 5 Pro is the first phone to bring it to India and combined with 4000mAh battery (again), Xiaomi might just have a winner at its hands., Build and Design: New Design, same approach
With the Redmi Note 4 we had a small complaint about the width of the phone and with the Note 5 and the Note 5 Pro, that has been resolved. Xiaomi’s solution is to provide a taller 18:9 aspect ratio display. The taller 5.99-inch 2160 x 1080p display is still not the best size for a comfortable fit, even though the width is now lesser than Its predecessor. That said, it is definitely an improvement over the last phone. The display has rounded corners and thinner bezels, which add to the whole design appeal. The curved back does make the phone easier to grip, but at the same time, it feels heavy and does take some time getting used to. There is no improvement as such in terms of materials used and unlike the Moto G5s Plus or the Mi A1, the Redmi Note 5 still doesn't have a metal unibody.

Although, note that there are other more powerful options this time in the form the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 which runs on the Snapdragon 636 and has stock Android interface. It will ultimately come down to the availability, and considering the dollar-rupee fluctuations, the price is also likely to increase in a few months., , Xiaomi is on a roll this year. There's a new Mi phone almost every month and this time, not one, but three devices have landed up in India. It only goes on to show how serious the company is about India and you might just call it Xiaomi's homeland, at least as far as smartphones are concerned. The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro that launched alongside the Xiaomi Redmi 6 and the Xiaomi Redmi 6A seems to be an attempt at refreshing the budget segment by infusing the very features that made Xiaomi's mid-rangers sell like hot cakes. And then there's the notch. The Redmi 6 Pro that we received for review could very well be the Mi A2 Lite as the hardware is exactly the same, except that it runs on MIUI, not stock Android. Now, the budget segment is one of the most competitive areas when it comes to smartphones. Will a feature-packed phone be enough for Xiaomi to win it once again?, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro looks identical to almost every other Redmi phone that has launched in the past year. The metal unibody design has been done to death, but it makes sense for this segment where durability is more important than a stunning glass design. However, there could've been variations in antenna lines and the camera placement and the likes, which would've meant a new arrangement of the innards. That'd have been costlier for the company. Nevertheless, the phone is built robustly and will take a few scratches and bumps., , Up front, you have Xiaomi embracing the notch. There's a rather large chin at the bottom while the notch houses the front camera, proximity sensor and the earpiece. It's the same notched design we've seen in phones right from the flagship segment to now the budget segment, and even if you don't like it, you have little choice. The buttons on Redmi phones have been reported to fail a lot and in this one too, they are made of plastic and are a little wobbly., , The Redmi 6 Pro is in no way the slimmest phone. A 4,000mAh battery is packed into a relatively compact body. It's quite hefty too, as a result, and that gives a good grip when you're holding the phone., Overall, the Redmi 6 Pro is compact, functional and durable., The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro touts a 5.84-inch display on top. It's an IPS LCD panel that the company likes to use in almost every mid-range offering. The aspect ratio is 19:9 because of the notch and the resolution is fullHD+. The screen is certainly rich and vibrant but as the ongoing debate will tell you, this smartphone can't stream HD content through Netflix and Amazon Prime Video as it doesn't meet the required Widevine L1 DRM standards. Because of the notch, the content will also be letter-boxed and you'll likely not be using the extra space the notch gives. The notch does help in making space for the status bar and the icons don't intrude into the space for content., , You get options to tweak the colour temperature, though I'll advise against that. There's also a blue light filter and the option to tap the screen to wake it up. It's especially useful if you don't want to stress the power button one too many times. The screen seems to be colour accurate, and videos on YouTube are enjoyable as long as you're okay with a smaller screen. It's a good phone to buy if you have long commutes via public transport., The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 coupled with 3/4 GB RAM and 32/64GB onboard storage. The 14nm octa-core chipset has featured in many other Xiaomi devices including the Redmi Y2 and the Redmi Note 5 this year. There's nothing exciting about the chipset anymore, but it's certainly reliable. The SoC is known for its power efficiency which is ideal for a budget device., As of writing this review, the benchmark apps were locked down under embargo, so we don't have the scores to compare the Redmi 6 Pro against the competition. But it's likely to be at par with other Snapdragon 625-powered smartphones., In real-life, the phone is responsive and decently fast. You will have to wait for a few seconds to launch heavy apps and having too many in the background can slow the phone down a bit. I launched Instagram, Facebook, Chrome with 15 tabs, camera and PubG Mobile back to back, and there was a noticeable lag in loading the apps once again. Still, the thermals are kept more or less in check. The phone doesn't get very hot when stressed., As for gaming, this isn't the ideal choice. The Snapdragon 625 uses an Adreno 506 GPU which now seems aged as compared to the newer 5-series GPU you get in the Snapdragon 636 and the Snapdragon 660 which are more optimised to handle heavy titles like PubG Mobile. On the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro, the game runs on low graphics and the gameplay gets a bit choppy after a while., , The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro uses Xiaomi's MIUI 9.6. The same phone is available with stock Android as the Mi A2 Lite in European markets. Xiaomi's UI is packed with features and takes heavy inspiration from Google's material design. There are card-based menus, and flat, square icons. You do have the option to change the theme and icons. The phone also supports gesture-based navigation which takes a bit of time to learn, and becomes muscle-memory after a point. There also some deeper system optimisation that Xiaomi claims to have done to make the UI feel more responsive., Xiaomi promises an upgrade to MIUI 10 soon and an Android 9 Pie update as well later this year. Going by the company's record of pushing out updates though, I'd be skeptical., Camera, The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro sports a dual camera unit at the back which juts out ever so slightly. There's a primary 12MP sensor with 1.25um pixel pitch and a f/2.2 aperture lens. Additionally, there’s also EIS for videos. That is combined with another 5MP sensor to capture depth information. Up front is a 5MP selfie camera with f/2.0 lens., , The camera performs decently well in its price range. In daytime, the photos come out fairly sharp and crisp. There isn't a noticeable shutter lag when you’re shooting in the day and the focus locks on fast enough thanks to PDAF., , HDR isn't on by default, and for good reason. HDR shots take a good 1-1.5 seconds to capture, so if you're shooting a moving object, it's not a good idea., Indoors, the camera takes sharp, oversaturated photos with high contrast. The results, for most, will be pleasing to the eyes. The camera does have a tendency to expose the source of light more than the rest, so the resulting image can be a little dark., , The Redmi 6 Pro struggles under low light. There's a noticeable shutter lag because it automatically switches to the Low-light mode. The shutter remains open for longer so you need to have steady hands as this doesn’t have OIS. There's also a lot of noise in the darker regions., The portrait mode works decently enough. It's not as good as what we've seen in the Mi A2, but does the job well enough. The edges are blurred more or less consistently, although the bokeh itself looks forced and artificial sometimes., , Selfies come out rich and vibrant. There's no pixel binning happening here like on the Redmi Y2, but the results are decent. It won't work well if there's a harsh backlight though. The resolution isn't as high either., One of the highlights of the Redmi 6 Pro is the massive 4,000mAh battery that easily lasts over a day, if you use it moderately. While writing this review, I used the phone to browse social media, navigated via Google Maps, took photos, and played games. I still had around 25 percent left at the end of the day., As mentioned above, we were prevented from running our tests as the benchmark apps were all locked down., If you are an avid gamer though, you will have to plug the phone for charge by evening. Heavy titles like PubG drain the battery relatively faster. There's no Quick Charge support, so you'll need to keep it plugged in for around 1.5-2 hours., The Redmi 6 Pro comes off a reliable and functional compact phone under a tight budget. At Rs 12,999, the phone will cannibalise Xiaomi's own Redmi 5 and the Redmi Note 5. To be fair, this seems to be more of the same hardware we've seen before from Xiaomi in this segment. There are other good options like the Realme 2 and the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1. Only this time, there's a notch. Depending on where you stand, you'll either like it or hate it. But overall, the Redmi 6 Pro is something we'd easily recommend if you have a tight budget. Good luck buying one, though as this too will be offered in flash sales in the beginning."

The screen seems to be colour accurate, and videos on YouTube are enjoyable as long as you're okay with a smaller screen. It's a good phone to buy if you have long commutes via public transport., The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 coupled with 3/4 GB RAM and 32/64GB onboard storage. The 14nm octa-core chipset has featured in many other Xiaomi devices including the Redmi Y2 and the Redmi Note 5 this year. There's nothing exciting about the chipset anymore, but it's certainly reliable. The SoC is known for its power efficiency which is ideal for a budget device., As of writing this review, the benchmark apps were locked down under embargo, so we don't have the scores to compare the Redmi 6 Pro against the competition. But it's likely to be at par with other Snapdragon 625-powered smartphones., In real-life, the phone is responsive and decently fast. You will have to wait for a few seconds to launch heavy apps and having too many in the background can slow the phone down a bit. I launched Instagram, Facebook, Chrome with 15 tabs, camera and PubG Mobile back to back, and there was a noticeable lag in loading the apps once again. Still, the thermals are kept more or less in check. The phone doesn't get very hot when stressed., As for gaming, this isn't the ideal choice. The Snapdragon 625 uses an Adreno 506 GPU which now seems aged as compared to the newer 5-series GPU you get in the Snapdragon 636 and the Snapdragon 660 which are more optimised to handle heavy titles like PubG Mobile. On the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro, the game runs on low graphics and the gameplay gets a bit choppy after a while., , The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro uses Xiaomi's MIUI 9.6. The same phone is available with stock Android as the Mi A2 Lite in European markets. Xiaomi's UI is packed with features and takes heavy inspiration from Google's material design. There are card-based menus, and flat, square icons. You do have the option to change the theme and icons. The phone also supports gesture-based navigation which takes a bit of time to learn, and becomes muscle-memory after a point. There also some deeper system optimisation that Xiaomi claims to have done to make the UI feel more responsive., Xiaomi promises an upgrade to MIUI 10 soon and an Android 9 Pie update as well later this year. Going by the company's record of pushing out updates though, I'd be skeptical., Camera, The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro sports a dual camera unit at the back which juts out ever so slightly. There's a primary 12MP sensor with 1.25um pixel pitch and a f/2.2 aperture lens. Additionally, there’s also EIS for videos. That is combined with another 5MP sensor to capture depth information. Up front is a 5MP selfie camera with f/2.0 lens., , The camera performs decently well in its price range. In daytime, the photos come out fairly sharp and crisp. There isn't a noticeable shutter lag when you’re shooting in the day and the focus locks on fast enough thanks to PDAF., , HDR isn't on by default, and for good reason. HDR shots take a good 1-1.5 seconds to capture, so if you're shooting a moving object, it's not a good idea., Indoors, the camera takes sharp, oversaturated photos with high contrast. The results, for most, will be pleasing to the eyes. The camera does have a tendency to expose the source of light more than the rest, so the resulting image can be a little dark., , The Redmi 6 Pro struggles under low light. There's a noticeable shutter lag because it automatically switches to the Low-light mode. The shutter remains open for longer so you need to have steady hands as this doesn’t have OIS. There's also a lot of noise in the darker regions., The portrait mode works decently enough. It's not as good as what we've seen in the Mi A2, but does the job well enough. The edges are blurred more or less consistently, although the bokeh itself looks forced and artificial sometimes., , Selfies come out rich and vibrant. There's no pixel binning happening here like on the Redmi Y2, but the results are decent. It won't work well if there's a harsh backlight though. The resolution isn't as high either., One of the highlights of the Redmi 6 Pro is the massive 4,000mAh battery that easily lasts over a day, if you use it moderately. While writing this review, I used the phone to browse social media, navigated via Google Maps, took photos, and played games. I still had around 25 percent left at the end of the day., As mentioned above, we were prevented from running our tests as the benchmark apps were all locked down., If you are an avid gamer though, you will have to plug the phone for charge by evening. Heavy titles like PubG drain the battery relatively faster. There's no Quick Charge support, so you'll need to keep it plugged in for around 1.5-2 hours., The Redmi 6 Pro comes off a reliable and functional compact phone under a tight budget. At Rs 12,999, the phone will cannibalise Xiaomi's own Redmi 5 and the Redmi Note 5. To be fair, this seems to be more of the same hardware we've seen before from Xiaomi in this segment. There are other good options like the Realme 2 and the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1. Only this time, there's a notch. Depending on where you stand, you'll either like it or hate it. But overall, the Redmi 6 Pro is something we'd easily recommend if you have a tight budget. Good luck buying one, though as this too will be offered in flash sales in the beginning."

The phone isn't going to turn heads, but if you're looking for something reliable and functional, the Redmi 6 Pro is a good choice. Although, note that there are other more powerful options this time in the form the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 which runs on the Snapdragon 636 and has stock Android interface. It will ultimately come down to the availability, and considering the dollar-rupee fluctuations, the price is also likely to increase in a few months., , Xiaomi is on a roll this year. There's a new Mi phone almost every month and this time, not one, but three devices have landed up in India. It only goes on to show how serious the company is about India and you might just call it Xiaomi's homeland, at least as far as smartphones are concerned. The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro that launched alongside the Xiaomi Redmi 6 and the Xiaomi Redmi 6A seems to be an attempt at refreshing the budget segment by infusing the very features that made Xiaomi's mid-rangers sell like hot cakes. And then there's the notch. The Redmi 6 Pro that we received for review could very well be the Mi A2 Lite as the hardware is exactly the same, except that it runs on MIUI, not stock Android. Now, the budget segment is one of the most competitive areas when it comes to smartphones. Will a feature-packed phone be enough for Xiaomi to win it once again?, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro looks identical to almost every other Redmi phone that has launched in the past year. The metal unibody design has been done to death, but it makes sense for this segment where durability is more important than a stunning glass design. However, there could've been variations in antenna lines and the camera placement and the likes, which would've meant a new arrangement of the innards. That'd have been costlier for the company. Nevertheless, the phone is built robustly and will take a few scratches and bumps., , Up front, you have Xiaomi embracing the notch. There's a rather large chin at the bottom while the notch houses the front camera, proximity sensor and the earpiece. It's the same notched design we've seen in phones right from the flagship segment to now the budget segment, and even if you don't like it, you have little choice. The buttons on Redmi phones have been reported to fail a lot and in this one too, they are made of plastic and are a little wobbly., , The Redmi 6 Pro is in no way the slimmest phone. A 4,000mAh battery is packed into a relatively compact body. It's quite hefty too, as a result, and that gives a good grip when you're holding the phone., Overall, the Redmi 6 Pro is compact, functional and durable., The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro touts a 5.84-inch display on top. It's an IPS LCD panel that the company likes to use in almost every mid-range offering. The aspect ratio is 19:9 because of the notch and the resolution is fullHD+. The screen is certainly rich and vibrant but as the ongoing debate will tell you, this smartphone can't stream HD content through Netflix and Amazon Prime Video as it doesn't meet the required Widevine L1 DRM standards. Because of the notch, the content will also be letter-boxed and you'll likely not be using the extra space the notch gives. The notch does help in making space for the status bar and the icons don't intrude into the space for content., , You get options to tweak the colour temperature, though I'll advise against that.

There's also a lot of noise in the darker regions., The portrait mode works decently enough. It's not as good as what we've seen in the Mi A2, but does the job well enough. The edges are blurred more or less consistently, although the bokeh itself looks forced and artificial sometimes., , Selfies come out rich and vibrant. There's no pixel binning happening here like on the Redmi Y2, but the results are decent. It won't work well if there's a harsh backlight though. The resolution isn't as high either., One of the highlights of the Redmi 6 Pro is the massive 4,000mAh battery that easily lasts over a day, if you use it moderately. While writing this review, I used the phone to browse social media, navigated via Google Maps, took photos, and played games. I still had around 25 percent left at the end of the day., As mentioned above, we were prevented from running our tests as the benchmark apps were all locked down., If you are an avid gamer though, you will have to plug the phone for charge by evening. Heavy titles like PubG drain the battery relatively faster. There's no Quick Charge support, so you'll need to keep it plugged in for around 1.5-2 hours., The Redmi 6 Pro comes off a reliable and functional compact phone under a tight budget. At Rs 12,999, the phone will cannibalise Xiaomi's own Redmi 5 and the Redmi Note 5. To be fair, this seems to be more of the same hardware we've seen before from Xiaomi in this segment. There are other good options like the Realme 2 and the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1. Only this time, there's a notch. Depending on where you stand, you'll either like it or hate it. But overall, the Redmi 6 Pro is something we'd easily recommend if you have a tight budget. Good luck buying one, though as this too will be offered in flash sales in the beginning."

It’s meant for those who are upgrading from a feature phone to a smartphone for the first time. However, anyone buying the phone after years of using a feature phone might not be quite happy with the experience. It’s painfully sluggish to use because of the lower RAM, but the battery life of the phone is sufficient enough to surprise even a feature-phone user., , Xiaomi’s Redmi 5A last year was a revelation in the entry-level segment. According to the company, it sold around 5 million units of the smartphone till March 2018. It’s September and surely the company must have sold a lot more. Naturally, the successor to a device as popular as that will carry high expectations. The Xiaomi Redmi 6A aims to take over the baton as the phone to get if you’re upgrading from a feature phone, and it brings bearing features from more expensive phones. But did Xiaomi get it right the second time? Let’s find out., Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, , The Xiaomi Redmi 6A incorporates a design similar to more expensive Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Redmi Y2 - A metal body design, taller display and the likes. It’s comfortably compact with a 5.45-inch display fitted into a 5.8-inch body. It’s slightly bigger than the Redmi 5A but offers more screen real estate than last time.  The design with rounded edges isn’t going to turn heads, but it’s perfectly functional. Tapping on the back of the phone indicates that the metal casing on the phone isn’t as hard, but it will be resistant to scratches. It’s also quite resistant to fingerprints and smudges. A single camera unit is aligned horizontally in the top left corner and the way the flash unit is positioned, it’s easy to mistake it as a dual camera unit. Furthermore, the speakers are placed at the back and sound gets muffled if you’re watching something holding the phone in the landscape format. The buttons on the right side are a little rickety and based on user complaints over the years, the buttons on Redmi phones are the first to stop working., The target audience for the smartphone do max out their options for cheap data along with having enough space to store music and videos to watch on the go, which is why there is a dual SIM slot with a dedicated microSD card slot that can expand the storage by up to 256GB. The Xiaomi Redmi 6A also supports dual standby and dual VoLTE which allows users to enable HD calling on both the SIMs and enjoy internet data from both the SIM cards., The Xiaomi Redmi 6A is also quite handy to use. If you’re used to travelling in crowded buses and metros, the phone will be easier to use in such situations. The curved edges render a good grip and even with a taller display, it’s easy to use one handed. Note that there is no fingerprint sensor on the phone. The Redmi 6A relies on face unlock and traditional PIN-based unlock., , The Xiaomi Redmi 6A touts a 5.45-inch IPS LCD display with a 720x1440 pixel resolution. It’s in the newer 18:9 display format and that provides a lot more screen real estate. The math indicates there’s only 295 pixels per density. The phone compensates that with added brightness which makes the panel sufficiently legible while indoors. 720p content also look pretty sharp and but out in the open sky, the colours look visibly washed out. The content also adapts to the taller display. YouTube videos can be stretched to fill the screen but it also crops out a part of the video. It’s a functional display at best, and at its price, the extra real estate is more than welcome., , , The Xiaomi Redmi 6A ushers a new era of Xiaomi phones in India. It’s the first of the two devices in the new lineup to feature a MediaTek chipset. The Redmi 6A is powered by the new MediaTek Helio A22 SoC. It’s a 12nm quad-core chipset with two performance cores clocked at 2.0GHz. Like the Snapdragon 425 used on the Redmi 5A last year, this also relies on the Cortex A53 cores. And being made on a 12nm process, it’s also more efficient than the 28nm-based Snapdragon 425., The benchmark results easily peg the Redmi 6A as visibly more powerful. AnTuTu 7.06 gives a score of 62292 while on 3DMark Slingshot the entry-level phone scores 451 indicating it’s not a good device for playing games. On Geekbench Single Core and Multi Core tests, the Redmi 6A scores 817 and 2376, both higher than last year’s Redmi 5A., But while the chipset is perfectly capable of handling day to day tasks, the bottleneck is in the RAM. You get 2GB of RAM as compared to 3GB in the Redmi 5A. It's not adequate enough to allow multi-tasking and the experience of using the phone is actually quite sluggish. Add to that 16GB on board and you suddenly see Xiaomi walking backwards. You only get around 10GB worth of storage which will get easily filled up in a few months of usage. The higher variant does offer 32GB storage on board and if you're planning to get this device, I'd recommend to go for this one. You'll still be stuck with inadequate RAM though., The Xiaomi Redmi 6A runs on MIUI 9.6 based on Android 8.1 Oreo. Options like picture-in-picture and improved notifications are what you'll get over its predecessor. But the experience won't be as satisfactory though. If you have even two-three apps open in the background, you'll see noticeable lags in operating the phone. Apps like the Dialer takes a good ten seconds to launch., , The Xiaomi Redmi 6A sports a 13MP camera at the back and a 5MP camera up front. Even for a entry-level device, the quality of photos seems good enough when there’s ample light. It’s  low on dynamic range and colours get lost in the shadows, but it shoots well exposed photos otherwise. The camera app is a bit sluggish though. It takes some time to focus and there’s a noticeable lag after you’ve shot the photo., , , The camera algorithms work to enhance the saturation and contrast and that results in eye-pleasing shots indoors. Under low-light though, there is ample amount of noise with little detail reproduction. That’s understandable considering the price of the phone., , The front camera is also quite capable of taking good selfies, although if you’re taking it against a strong source of light, the face gets silhouetted., The Xiaomi Redmi 6A is powered by a 3,000mAh battery. It's perfectly sufficient to last more than a day. On the PCMark Work 2.0 test, we got around 8 hours of screen on time that should easily convert to around one and a half days of usage. I believe it’s the efficiency of the 12nm chipset that does the trick and a smaller display with lower resolution also helps in saving power. The Xiaomi  Redmi 6A doesn’t support fast charging though and it takes a good two hours to top up the device., The Xiaomi Redmi 6A is Xiaomi’s most affordable offering this year.

However, anyone buying the phone after years of using a feature phone might not be quite happy with the experience. It’s painfully sluggish to use because of the lower RAM, but the battery life of the phone is sufficient enough to surprise even a feature-phone user., , Xiaomi’s Redmi 5A last year was a revelation in the entry-level segment. According to the company, it sold around 5 million units of the smartphone till March 2018. It’s September and surely the company must have sold a lot more. Naturally, the successor to a device as popular as that will carry high expectations. The Xiaomi Redmi 6A aims to take over the baton as the phone to get if you’re upgrading from a feature phone, and it brings bearing features from more expensive phones. But did Xiaomi get it right the second time? Let’s find out., Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, , The Xiaomi Redmi 6A incorporates a design similar to more expensive Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Redmi Y2 - A metal body design, taller display and the likes. It’s comfortably compact with a 5.45-inch display fitted into a 5.8-inch body. It’s slightly bigger than the Redmi 5A but offers more screen real estate than last time.  The design with rounded edges isn’t going to turn heads, but it’s perfectly functional. Tapping on the back of the phone indicates that the metal casing on the phone isn’t as hard, but it will be resistant to scratches. It’s also quite resistant to fingerprints and smudges. A single camera unit is aligned horizontally in the top left corner and the way the flash unit is positioned, it’s easy to mistake it as a dual camera unit. Furthermore, the speakers are placed at the back and sound gets muffled if you’re watching something holding the phone in the landscape format. The buttons on the right side are a little rickety and based on user complaints over the years, the buttons on Redmi phones are the first to stop working., The target audience for the smartphone do max out their options for cheap data along with having enough space to store music and videos to watch on the go, which is why there is a dual SIM slot with a dedicated microSD card slot that can expand the storage by up to 256GB. The Xiaomi Redmi 6A also supports dual standby and dual VoLTE which allows users to enable HD calling on both the SIMs and enjoy internet data from both the SIM cards., The Xiaomi Redmi 6A is also quite handy to use. If you’re used to travelling in crowded buses and metros, the phone will be easier to use in such situations. The curved edges render a good grip and even with a taller display, it’s easy to use one handed. Note that there is no fingerprint sensor on the phone. The Redmi 6A relies on face unlock and traditional PIN-based unlock., , The Xiaomi Redmi 6A touts a 5.45-inch IPS LCD display with a 720x1440 pixel resolution. It’s in the newer 18:9 display format and that provides a lot more screen real estate. The math indicates there’s only 295 pixels per density. The phone compensates that with added brightness which makes the panel sufficiently legible while indoors. 720p content also look pretty sharp and but out in the open sky, the colours look visibly washed out. The content also adapts to the taller display. YouTube videos can be stretched to fill the screen but it also crops out a part of the video. It’s a functional display at best, and at its price, the extra real estate is more than welcome., , , The Xiaomi Redmi 6A ushers a new era of Xiaomi phones in India. It’s the first of the two devices in the new lineup to feature a MediaTek chipset. The Redmi 6A is powered by the new MediaTek Helio A22 SoC. It’s a 12nm quad-core chipset with two performance cores clocked at 2.0GHz. Like the Snapdragon 425 used on the Redmi 5A last year, this also relies on the Cortex A53 cores. And being made on a 12nm process, it’s also more efficient than the 28nm-based Snapdragon 425., The benchmark results easily peg the Redmi 6A as visibly more powerful. AnTuTu 7.06 gives a score of 62292 while on 3DMark Slingshot the entry-level phone scores 451 indicating it’s not a good device for playing games. On Geekbench Single Core and Multi Core tests, the Redmi 6A scores 817 and 2376, both higher than last year’s Redmi 5A., But while the chipset is perfectly capable of handling day to day tasks, the bottleneck is in the RAM. You get 2GB of RAM as compared to 3GB in the Redmi 5A. It's not adequate enough to allow multi-tasking and the experience of using the phone is actually quite sluggish. Add to that 16GB on board and you suddenly see Xiaomi walking backwards. You only get around 10GB worth of storage which will get easily filled up in a few months of usage. The higher variant does offer 32GB storage on board and if you're planning to get this device, I'd recommend to go for this one. You'll still be stuck with inadequate RAM though., The Xiaomi Redmi 6A runs on MIUI 9.6 based on Android 8.1 Oreo. Options like picture-in-picture and improved notifications are what you'll get over its predecessor. But the experience won't be as satisfactory though. If you have even two-three apps open in the background, you'll see noticeable lags in operating the phone. Apps like the Dialer takes a good ten seconds to launch., , The Xiaomi Redmi 6A sports a 13MP camera at the back and a 5MP camera up front. Even for a entry-level device, the quality of photos seems good enough when there’s ample light. It’s  low on dynamic range and colours get lost in the shadows, but it shoots well exposed photos otherwise. The camera app is a bit sluggish though. It takes some time to focus and there’s a noticeable lag after you’ve shot the photo., , , The camera algorithms work to enhance the saturation and contrast and that results in eye-pleasing shots indoors. Under low-light though, there is ample amount of noise with little detail reproduction. That’s understandable considering the price of the phone., , The front camera is also quite capable of taking good selfies, although if you’re taking it against a strong source of light, the face gets silhouetted., The Xiaomi Redmi 6A is powered by a 3,000mAh battery. It's perfectly sufficient to last more than a day. On the PCMark Work 2.0 test, we got around 8 hours of screen on time that should easily convert to around one and a half days of usage. I believe it’s the efficiency of the 12nm chipset that does the trick and a smaller display with lower resolution also helps in saving power. The Xiaomi  Redmi 6A doesn’t support fast charging though and it takes a good two hours to top up the device., The Xiaomi Redmi 6A is Xiaomi’s most affordable offering this year.

2499,,xiaomi-redmi-7-review-177285,0,0,2019-05-22,177285,Vignesh Giridharan,Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/xiaomi-redmi-7-review-177285.html,"The Redmi 7 is a fairly good all-rounder that excels in the display and camera departments. Where it falls short, sadly, is in the overall build quality. It’s a great buy nonetheless., , If it rained in New Delhi as often as Xiaomi launched a new smartphone model, the capital city would be a whole lot cooler, don’t you think? Only last month, the Chinese electronics giant launched two new budget models under the Redmi brand name (Redmi Y3 and Redmi 7) with one more to follow (Redmi 7A). A little before that, it launched the Redmi Go, Xiaomi’s cheapest smartphone as of today, with Android Go running the show. While the Redmi Y3 was picked up for a review by my esteemed colleague Subhrojit, the Redmi 7 found its way to me. Having bid goodbye to the rather likeable Nokia 4.2, I picked it up to give it a proper go., , Redmi 7 in Lunar Red, Labelling it “the ultimate all-rounder”, Xiaomi has blessed the Redmi 7 with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 chipset, up to 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of internal storage space as standard. The screen measures 6.26 inches diagonally and sports a “dot notch” at the top for the selfie camera. Starting at a price of Rs 7,999 at the time of writing this review, the Redmi 7 comes in three colour options: Eclipse Black, Comet Blue, and Lunar Red. The latter two come with a gradient finish on the back. Read on to see how our Lunar Red review unit fared., , Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, , The Redmi 7’s front face gets Corning Gorilla Glass 5 to protect the display against minor scratches, while the back panel gets what appears to be a regular glossy plastic panel (Xiaomi hasn’t disclosed any specifics). A black plastic beading keeps the two panels together and houses all the ports and buttons. According to Xiaomi, the Redmi 7’s body comes with a P2i nano-coating that makes it splash-resistant but not waterproof, so it goes without saying that it does not get an IP rating. What this means for you is that you can call your Ola driver under a light spell of rain but not expose the Redmi 7 to a swimming pool., , Back panel is a fingerprint magnet, Though the review unit appeared to be built fairly well, there was one critical detail that occurred to me the minute I held it up in my hand: the rear panel didn’t fit the plastic frame very well, leaving just a bit of its sharp edge exposed on one side. It wasn’t sharp enough to cut a finger running over it but the poor fit made me wonder if the panel would ever come off in the future or weaken the phone’s structure greatly. In terms of build alone, the Redmi 7 could do better., , Back panel on left edge was too sharp, A fair number of budget smartphones come with a gradient finish on the back panel these days and the Redmi 7 is no different. It gives the phone a bit of much-needed class. Sadly, the glossy front and back panels of the Redmi 7 act as a powerful magnet for fingerprints and smudges. The top side of the phone is home to a 3.5mm audio jack, a secondary microphone, and an IR blaster. The left side houses just the SIM/microSD card tray., , Shrey loves showing off the two-tone back panel of the Redmi 7, , 3.5mm audio jack and Xiaomi-standard IR blaster, The bottom side reveals a microUSB port (for charging and data transfer) and loudspeaker grilles on either side of the port. Predictably, sound emanates from only one of those two grilles. The right side gets the power button and a volume rocker, both of which are sturdy and tactile. On the back, we see a dual camera setup with a visible camera bump and a fingerprint scanner, which, although positioned way too high up, works well for screen unlocks., , No USB-C here, , Buttons feel good to press, , The IPS LCD screen on the Redmi 7 measures 6.26 inches diagonally. It has an aspect ratio of 19:9 and a resolution of 1520 x 720 pixels. According to Xiaomi, it has a contrast ratio of 1500:1 and a screen-to-body ratio of nearly 87 percent. The pixel density sits at a decent 269 pixels per inch. According to our test kit, the review unit’s screen brightness went all the way up to 353 LUX, which is the going figure for phones of its segment. In comparison, the recently launched Nokia 4.2's display brightness maxed out at 333 LUX. Colours on the screen appeared vivid but seemed to have a light cool tinge about them. Maximum horizontal viewing angle sat somewhere close to a respectable 170 degrees. Surprisingly, there was almost no indication of light bleed from the LCD panel's backlight. All in all, the Redmi 7's display is well worth its salt., , Sound from the single down-firing loudspeaker is both loud and clear. Songs like The Weeknd’s Starboy played with a surprising amount of clarity across all three frequencies on the review unit. Low frequency sounds too were reproduced in the form of mild artificial thumps. Understandably, none of the low frequency sounds were felt from the tiny driver. In summary, the loudspeaker on the Redmi 7 does the job if you’re with your friends and want to show them a new song you’ve recently discovered. The earpiece, on the other hand, could do with a bit more volume for calls., , , The Redmi 7 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 chipset. First announced in June last year, the chip has a 14-nanometre octa-core processor, which consists of four Kryo 250 Gold processor cores and four Kryo 250 Silver processor cores, all clocking at 1.8GHz. The budget Xiaomi phone is offered in two variants: one with 2GB of RAM (at Rs 7,999) and another with 3GB of RAM (at Rs 8,999). Our review unit was the latter. Internal storage on both variants is a standard 32GB. External storage in the form of a microSD card goes all the way up to 512GB., In our benchmark tests, the Redmi 7 review unit fared pretty well. On AnTuTu 7.0, it scored 104809. In comparison, the costlier Nokia 4.2 (with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 chipset and 3GB of RAM) scored 62985 in the same test. On Geekbench Single-Core and Multi-Core tests, the Redmi 7 bagged 1240 and 4370 respectively. In comparison, the Nokia 4.2 managed 894 and 3338 in the same two tests respectively., , In everyday use scenarios, the Redmi 7 review unit performed satisfactorily. Launching, minimising, closing, and switching between apps was a trouble-free experience. There was no visible sign of lag or delay while jumping between numerous tabs in Chrome or while multitasking in general. I was able to browse and play videos online even comfortably even where there was some background activity going on, like app installations and game updates. If anything, there was that occasional stutter in animation while minimising and jumping between apps. But these hiccups didn’t necessarily slow the phone down; they only exposed the GPU’s limitation., The Redmi 7 review unit scored 916 in 3DMark’s Sling Shot GPU benchmark test. In comparison, the Nokia 4.2 scored 821. During our gaming sessions, Asphalt 9 ran at a median frame rate of 29 frames per second on the Redmi 7. PUBG Mobile, on the other hand, ran on forced Low graphics settings at a median frame rate of 26 frames per second. During actual gameplay, some elements in Asphalt 9 (like the car’s spoiler) were slightly pixelated but the animation seemed mostly consistent and stutter-free. The metrics for Asphalt 9 and PUBG Mobile were recorded using GameBench. To sum it up, the Redmi 7 is not for serious gamers but isn't a terrible choice if you're looking to play popular titles like PUBG Mobile on a budget., , , The Redmi 7 comes with a dual camera setup on the back and a single selfie shooter in the front. The rear cameras consist of a 12-megapixel 1.25μm primary sensor with an aperture of f/2.2 and a 2-megapixel depth sensor for portrait shots. They’re accompanied by a single LED flash. The selfie shooter is an 8-megapixel 1.12μm sensor with an aperture of f/2.0. According to Xiaomi, the shooters on the back feature “AI” for scene detection, portrait mode, and a function called Beautify 4.0., , Photos taken through the Redmi 7’s primary rear camera in daylight appear to be rich in colour even if the colours are a tad bit on the warmer side. Photos taken through Portrait mode in daylight are rendered quite well without any glaring errors in blurring the foreground subject. Selfies come out bright in daylight but suffer from a fair amount of noise when taken indoors. The camera app is eager to “beautify” faces but the beauty level can be turned down or even switched off altogether.

Where it falls short, sadly, is in the overall build quality. It’s a great buy nonetheless., , If it rained in New Delhi as often as Xiaomi launched a new smartphone model, the capital city would be a whole lot cooler, don’t you think? Only last month, the Chinese electronics giant launched two new budget models under the Redmi brand name (Redmi Y3 and Redmi 7) with one more to follow (Redmi 7A). A little before that, it launched the Redmi Go, Xiaomi’s cheapest smartphone as of today, with Android Go running the show. While the Redmi Y3 was picked up for a review by my esteemed colleague Subhrojit, the Redmi 7 found its way to me. Having bid goodbye to the rather likeable Nokia 4.2, I picked it up to give it a proper go., , Redmi 7 in Lunar Red, Labelling it “the ultimate all-rounder”, Xiaomi has blessed the Redmi 7 with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 chipset, up to 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of internal storage space as standard. The screen measures 6.26 inches diagonally and sports a “dot notch” at the top for the selfie camera. Starting at a price of Rs 7,999 at the time of writing this review, the Redmi 7 comes in three colour options: Eclipse Black, Comet Blue, and Lunar Red. The latter two come with a gradient finish on the back. Read on to see how our Lunar Red review unit fared., , Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, , The Redmi 7’s front face gets Corning Gorilla Glass 5 to protect the display against minor scratches, while the back panel gets what appears to be a regular glossy plastic panel (Xiaomi hasn’t disclosed any specifics). A black plastic beading keeps the two panels together and houses all the ports and buttons. According to Xiaomi, the Redmi 7’s body comes with a P2i nano-coating that makes it splash-resistant but not waterproof, so it goes without saying that it does not get an IP rating. What this means for you is that you can call your Ola driver under a light spell of rain but not expose the Redmi 7 to a swimming pool., , Back panel is a fingerprint magnet, Though the review unit appeared to be built fairly well, there was one critical detail that occurred to me the minute I held it up in my hand: the rear panel didn’t fit the plastic frame very well, leaving just a bit of its sharp edge exposed on one side. It wasn’t sharp enough to cut a finger running over it but the poor fit made me wonder if the panel would ever come off in the future or weaken the phone’s structure greatly. In terms of build alone, the Redmi 7 could do better., , Back panel on left edge was too sharp, A fair number of budget smartphones come with a gradient finish on the back panel these days and the Redmi 7 is no different. It gives the phone a bit of much-needed class. Sadly, the glossy front and back panels of the Redmi 7 act as a powerful magnet for fingerprints and smudges. The top side of the phone is home to a 3.5mm audio jack, a secondary microphone, and an IR blaster. The left side houses just the SIM/microSD card tray., , Shrey loves showing off the two-tone back panel of the Redmi 7, , 3.5mm audio jack and Xiaomi-standard IR blaster, The bottom side reveals a microUSB port (for charging and data transfer) and loudspeaker grilles on either side of the port. Predictably, sound emanates from only one of those two grilles. The right side gets the power button and a volume rocker, both of which are sturdy and tactile. On the back, we see a dual camera setup with a visible camera bump and a fingerprint scanner, which, although positioned way too high up, works well for screen unlocks., , No USB-C here, , Buttons feel good to press, , The IPS LCD screen on the Redmi 7 measures 6.26 inches diagonally. It has an aspect ratio of 19:9 and a resolution of 1520 x 720 pixels. According to Xiaomi, it has a contrast ratio of 1500:1 and a screen-to-body ratio of nearly 87 percent. The pixel density sits at a decent 269 pixels per inch. According to our test kit, the review unit’s screen brightness went all the way up to 353 LUX, which is the going figure for phones of its segment. In comparison, the recently launched Nokia 4.2's display brightness maxed out at 333 LUX. Colours on the screen appeared vivid but seemed to have a light cool tinge about them. Maximum horizontal viewing angle sat somewhere close to a respectable 170 degrees. Surprisingly, there was almost no indication of light bleed from the LCD panel's backlight. All in all, the Redmi 7's display is well worth its salt., , Sound from the single down-firing loudspeaker is both loud and clear. Songs like The Weeknd’s Starboy played with a surprising amount of clarity across all three frequencies on the review unit. Low frequency sounds too were reproduced in the form of mild artificial thumps. Understandably, none of the low frequency sounds were felt from the tiny driver. In summary, the loudspeaker on the Redmi 7 does the job if you’re with your friends and want to show them a new song you’ve recently discovered. The earpiece, on the other hand, could do with a bit more volume for calls., , , The Redmi 7 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 chipset. First announced in June last year, the chip has a 14-nanometre octa-core processor, which consists of four Kryo 250 Gold processor cores and four Kryo 250 Silver processor cores, all clocking at 1.8GHz. The budget Xiaomi phone is offered in two variants: one with 2GB of RAM (at Rs 7,999) and another with 3GB of RAM (at Rs 8,999). Our review unit was the latter. Internal storage on both variants is a standard 32GB. External storage in the form of a microSD card goes all the way up to 512GB., In our benchmark tests, the Redmi 7 review unit fared pretty well. On AnTuTu 7.0, it scored 104809. In comparison, the costlier Nokia 4.2 (with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 chipset and 3GB of RAM) scored 62985 in the same test. On Geekbench Single-Core and Multi-Core tests, the Redmi 7 bagged 1240 and 4370 respectively. In comparison, the Nokia 4.2 managed 894 and 3338 in the same two tests respectively., , In everyday use scenarios, the Redmi 7 review unit performed satisfactorily. Launching, minimising, closing, and switching between apps was a trouble-free experience. There was no visible sign of lag or delay while jumping between numerous tabs in Chrome or while multitasking in general. I was able to browse and play videos online even comfortably even where there was some background activity going on, like app installations and game updates. If anything, there was that occasional stutter in animation while minimising and jumping between apps. But these hiccups didn’t necessarily slow the phone down; they only exposed the GPU’s limitation., The Redmi 7 review unit scored 916 in 3DMark’s Sling Shot GPU benchmark test. In comparison, the Nokia 4.2 scored 821. During our gaming sessions, Asphalt 9 ran at a median frame rate of 29 frames per second on the Redmi 7. PUBG Mobile, on the other hand, ran on forced Low graphics settings at a median frame rate of 26 frames per second. During actual gameplay, some elements in Asphalt 9 (like the car’s spoiler) were slightly pixelated but the animation seemed mostly consistent and stutter-free. The metrics for Asphalt 9 and PUBG Mobile were recorded using GameBench. To sum it up, the Redmi 7 is not for serious gamers but isn't a terrible choice if you're looking to play popular titles like PUBG Mobile on a budget., , , The Redmi 7 comes with a dual camera setup on the back and a single selfie shooter in the front. The rear cameras consist of a 12-megapixel 1.25μm primary sensor with an aperture of f/2.2 and a 2-megapixel depth sensor for portrait shots. They’re accompanied by a single LED flash. The selfie shooter is an 8-megapixel 1.12μm sensor with an aperture of f/2.0. According to Xiaomi, the shooters on the back feature “AI” for scene detection, portrait mode, and a function called Beautify 4.0., , Photos taken through the Redmi 7’s primary rear camera in daylight appear to be rich in colour even if the colours are a tad bit on the warmer side. Photos taken through Portrait mode in daylight are rendered quite well without any glaring errors in blurring the foreground subject. Selfies come out bright in daylight but suffer from a fair amount of noise when taken indoors. The camera app is eager to “beautify” faces but the beauty level can be turned down or even switched off altogether. Lowlight photos shot through the primary camera are bright but appear distorted around sources of light. Lowlight selfies, on the other hand, suffer from a good amount of noise., , The default camera app is both easy to use and quick to react. Unlike the Nokia 4.2, whose default camera app is unbearably slow and ungainly, the Redmi 7 doesn’t suffer from unexpected stalls and hiccups while running the camera app. It even has options to take square photos (so they’re Instagram-ready) and a Pro mode (which allows digital tweaking of ISO speed, aperture, shutter speed, and white balance).

According to our test kit, the review unit’s screen brightness went all the way up to 353 LUX, which is the going figure for phones of its segment. In comparison, the recently launched Nokia 4.2's display brightness maxed out at 333 LUX. Colours on the screen appeared vivid but seemed to have a light cool tinge about them. Maximum horizontal viewing angle sat somewhere close to a respectable 170 degrees. Surprisingly, there was almost no indication of light bleed from the LCD panel's backlight. All in all, the Redmi 7's display is well worth its salt., , Sound from the single down-firing loudspeaker is both loud and clear. Songs like The Weeknd’s Starboy played with a surprising amount of clarity across all three frequencies on the review unit. Low frequency sounds too were reproduced in the form of mild artificial thumps. Understandably, none of the low frequency sounds were felt from the tiny driver. In summary, the loudspeaker on the Redmi 7 does the job if you’re with your friends and want to show them a new song you’ve recently discovered. The earpiece, on the other hand, could do with a bit more volume for calls., , , The Redmi 7 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 chipset. First announced in June last year, the chip has a 14-nanometre octa-core processor, which consists of four Kryo 250 Gold processor cores and four Kryo 250 Silver processor cores, all clocking at 1.8GHz. The budget Xiaomi phone is offered in two variants: one with 2GB of RAM (at Rs 7,999) and another with 3GB of RAM (at Rs 8,999). Our review unit was the latter. Internal storage on both variants is a standard 32GB. External storage in the form of a microSD card goes all the way up to 512GB., In our benchmark tests, the Redmi 7 review unit fared pretty well. On AnTuTu 7.0, it scored 104809. In comparison, the costlier Nokia 4.2 (with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 chipset and 3GB of RAM) scored 62985 in the same test. On Geekbench Single-Core and Multi-Core tests, the Redmi 7 bagged 1240 and 4370 respectively. In comparison, the Nokia 4.2 managed 894 and 3338 in the same two tests respectively., , In everyday use scenarios, the Redmi 7 review unit performed satisfactorily. Launching, minimising, closing, and switching between apps was a trouble-free experience. There was no visible sign of lag or delay while jumping between numerous tabs in Chrome or while multitasking in general. I was able to browse and play videos online even comfortably even where there was some background activity going on, like app installations and game updates. If anything, there was that occasional stutter in animation while minimising and jumping between apps. But these hiccups didn’t necessarily slow the phone down; they only exposed the GPU’s limitation., The Redmi 7 review unit scored 916 in 3DMark’s Sling Shot GPU benchmark test. In comparison, the Nokia 4.2 scored 821. During our gaming sessions, Asphalt 9 ran at a median frame rate of 29 frames per second on the Redmi 7. PUBG Mobile, on the other hand, ran on forced Low graphics settings at a median frame rate of 26 frames per second. During actual gameplay, some elements in Asphalt 9 (like the car’s spoiler) were slightly pixelated but the animation seemed mostly consistent and stutter-free. The metrics for Asphalt 9 and PUBG Mobile were recorded using GameBench. To sum it up, the Redmi 7 is not for serious gamers but isn't a terrible choice if you're looking to play popular titles like PUBG Mobile on a budget., , , The Redmi 7 comes with a dual camera setup on the back and a single selfie shooter in the front. The rear cameras consist of a 12-megapixel 1.25μm primary sensor with an aperture of f/2.2 and a 2-megapixel depth sensor for portrait shots. They’re accompanied by a single LED flash. The selfie shooter is an 8-megapixel 1.12μm sensor with an aperture of f/2.0. According to Xiaomi, the shooters on the back feature “AI” for scene detection, portrait mode, and a function called Beautify 4.0., , Photos taken through the Redmi 7’s primary rear camera in daylight appear to be rich in colour even if the colours are a tad bit on the warmer side. Photos taken through Portrait mode in daylight are rendered quite well without any glaring errors in blurring the foreground subject. Selfies come out bright in daylight but suffer from a fair amount of noise when taken indoors. The camera app is eager to “beautify” faces but the beauty level can be turned down or even switched off altogether. Lowlight photos shot through the primary camera are bright but appear distorted around sources of light. Lowlight selfies, on the other hand, suffer from a good amount of noise., , The default camera app is both easy to use and quick to react. Unlike the Nokia 4.2, whose default camera app is unbearably slow and ungainly, the Redmi 7 doesn’t suffer from unexpected stalls and hiccups while running the camera app. It even has options to take square photos (so they’re Instagram-ready) and a Pro mode (which allows digital tweaking of ISO speed, aperture, shutter speed, and white balance). To sum it up, the Redmi 7 churns out surprisingly respectable photos, given the phone’s modest price tag., Disclaimer: Photos below have been resized for the web.

It also comes with numerous theme and wallpaper options. Despite that and the many features MIUI brings (its own set of everyday tools, like a calendar, calculator, etc.), I am personally not a fan of MIUI for one big reason: it comes filled with a tonne of ads and bloatware., , The Redmi 7 sports a 4,000mAh non-removable battery. On our standard battery benchmark test, the review unit lasted 545 minutes, which exceeds the Nokia 4.2’s score by only 15 minutes on the same test. For your reference, the Nokia 4.2 sports a much smaller 3,000mAh battery. In everyday use scenarios, the Redmi 7 review unit lasted somewhere close to two full days on a single charge., During the tests, the phone was put through many sessions of web browsing, gaming, online video playback, and simultaneous app installs and downloads. Even after a day of medium-to-heavy use, the battery only fell from 100 to 60 percent. Leaving the phone unattended for nearly an entire day didn’t seem to have too big an impact on the battery (less than a 5-percent drop), which means standby battery consumption on the Redmi 7 is fairly meagre. The Redmi 7 should last you up to one and a half days even with fairly heavy use., The Redmi 7 offers a good load of value for its price. The budget Xiaomi phone does surprisingly well on the display and camera fronts. Its performance too is up to the mark. PUBG Mobile players on a budget should be quite happy with its ability to push pixels. All things considered, the Redmi 7 really is a fairly good all-rounder. What’s its Achilles heel then? Build quality, easily, especially on the back. I wish the edge of the rear panel didn’t threaten to scratch my finger every time I lifted the phone up."

Where it falls short, sadly, is in the overall build quality. It’s a great buy nonetheless., , If it rained in New Delhi as often as Xiaomi launched a new smartphone model, the capital city would be a whole lot cooler, don’t you think? Only last month, the Chinese electronics giant launched two new budget models under the Redmi brand name (Redmi Y3 and Redmi 7) with one more to follow (Redmi 7A). A little before that, it launched the Redmi Go, Xiaomi’s cheapest smartphone as of today, with Android Go running the show. While the Redmi Y3 was picked up for a review by my esteemed colleague Subhrojit, the Redmi 7 found its way to me. Having bid goodbye to the rather likeable Nokia 4.2, I picked it up to give it a proper go., , Redmi 7 in Lunar Red, Labelling it “the ultimate all-rounder”, Xiaomi has blessed the Redmi 7 with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 chipset, up to 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of internal storage space as standard. The screen measures 6.26 inches diagonally and sports a “dot notch” at the top for the selfie camera. Starting at a price of Rs 7,999 at the time of writing this review, the Redmi 7 comes in three colour options: Eclipse Black, Comet Blue, and Lunar Red. The latter two come with a gradient finish on the back.

A black plastic beading keeps the two panels together and houses all the ports and buttons. According to Xiaomi, the Redmi 7’s body comes with a P2i nano-coating that makes it splash-resistant but not waterproof, so it goes without saying that it does not get an IP rating. What this means for you is that you can call your Ola driver under a light spell of rain but not expose the Redmi 7 to a swimming pool., , Back panel is a fingerprint magnet, Though the review unit appeared to be built fairly well, there was one critical detail that occurred to me the minute I held it up in my hand: the rear panel didn’t fit the plastic frame very well, leaving just a bit of its sharp edge exposed on one side. It wasn’t sharp enough to cut a finger running over it but the poor fit made me wonder if the panel would ever come off in the future or weaken the phone’s structure greatly. In terms of build alone, the Redmi 7 could do better., , Back panel on left edge was too sharp, A fair number of budget smartphones come with a gradient finish on the back panel these days and the Redmi 7 is no different. It gives the phone a bit of much-needed class. Sadly, the glossy front and back panels of the Redmi 7 act as a powerful magnet for fingerprints and smudges. The top side of the phone is home to a 3.5mm audio jack, a secondary microphone, and an IR blaster. The left side houses just the SIM/microSD card tray., , Shrey loves showing off the two-tone back panel of the Redmi 7, , 3.5mm audio jack and Xiaomi-standard IR blaster, The bottom side reveals a microUSB port (for charging and data transfer) and loudspeaker grilles on either side of the port. Predictably, sound emanates from only one of those two grilles. The right side gets the power button and a volume rocker, both of which are sturdy and tactile. On the back, we see a dual camera setup with a visible camera bump and a fingerprint scanner, which, although positioned way too high up, works well for screen unlocks., , No USB-C here, , Buttons feel good to press, , The IPS LCD screen on the Redmi 7 measures 6.26 inches diagonally. It has an aspect ratio of 19:9 and a resolution of 1520 x 720 pixels. According to Xiaomi, it has a contrast ratio of 1500:1 and a screen-to-body ratio of nearly 87 percent.

Where it falls short, sadly, is in the overall build quality. It’s a great buy nonetheless., , If it rained in New Delhi as often as Xiaomi launched a new smartphone model, the capital city would be a whole lot cooler, don’t you think? Only last month, the Chinese electronics giant launched two new budget models under the Redmi brand name (Redmi Y3 and Redmi 7) with one more to follow (Redmi 7A). A little before that, it launched the Redmi Go, Xiaomi’s cheapest smartphone as of today, with Android Go running the show. While the Redmi Y3 was picked up for a review by my esteemed colleague Subhrojit, the Redmi 7 found its way to me.

The screen measures 6.26 inches diagonally and sports a “dot notch” at the top for the selfie camera. Starting at a price of Rs 7,999 at the time of writing this review, the Redmi 7 comes in three colour options: Eclipse Black, Comet Blue, and Lunar Red. The latter two come with a gradient finish on the back. Read on to see how our Lunar Red review unit fared., , Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, , The Redmi 7’s front face gets Corning Gorilla Glass 5 to protect the display against minor scratches, while the back panel gets what appears to be a regular glossy plastic panel (Xiaomi hasn’t disclosed any specifics). A black plastic beading keeps the two panels together and houses all the ports and buttons. According to Xiaomi, the Redmi 7’s body comes with a P2i nano-coating that makes it splash-resistant but not waterproof, so it goes without saying that it does not get an IP rating. What this means for you is that you can call your Ola driver under a light spell of rain but not expose the Redmi 7 to a swimming pool., , Back panel is a fingerprint magnet, Though the review unit appeared to be built fairly well, there was one critical detail that occurred to me the minute I held it up in my hand: the rear panel didn’t fit the plastic frame very well, leaving just a bit of its sharp edge exposed on one side. It wasn’t sharp enough to cut a finger running over it but the poor fit made me wonder if the panel would ever come off in the future or weaken the phone’s structure greatly. In terms of build alone, the Redmi 7 could do better., , Back panel on left edge was too sharp, A fair number of budget smartphones come with a gradient finish on the back panel these days and the Redmi 7 is no different. It gives the phone a bit of much-needed class. Sadly, the glossy front and back panels of the Redmi 7 act as a powerful magnet for fingerprints and smudges. The top side of the phone is home to a 3.5mm audio jack, a secondary microphone, and an IR blaster. The left side houses just the SIM/microSD card tray., , Shrey loves showing off the two-tone back panel of the Redmi 7, , 3.5mm audio jack and Xiaomi-standard IR blaster, The bottom side reveals a microUSB port (for charging and data transfer) and loudspeaker grilles on either side of the port. Predictably, sound emanates from only one of those two grilles. The right side gets the power button and a volume rocker, both of which are sturdy and tactile. On the back, we see a dual camera setup with a visible camera bump and a fingerprint scanner, which, although positioned way too high up, works well for screen unlocks., , No USB-C here, , Buttons feel good to press, , The IPS LCD screen on the Redmi 7 measures 6.26 inches diagonally. It has an aspect ratio of 19:9 and a resolution of 1520 x 720 pixels. According to Xiaomi, it has a contrast ratio of 1500:1 and a screen-to-body ratio of nearly 87 percent. The pixel density sits at a decent 269 pixels per inch. According to our test kit, the review unit’s screen brightness went all the way up to 353 LUX, which is the going figure for phones of its segment. In comparison, the recently launched Nokia 4.2's display brightness maxed out at 333 LUX. Colours on the screen appeared vivid but seemed to have a light cool tinge about them. Maximum horizontal viewing angle sat somewhere close to a respectable 170 degrees. Surprisingly, there was almost no indication of light bleed from the LCD panel's backlight. All in all, the Redmi 7's display is well worth its salt., , Sound from the single down-firing loudspeaker is both loud and clear. Songs like The Weeknd’s Starboy played with a surprising amount of clarity across all three frequencies on the review unit. Low frequency sounds too were reproduced in the form of mild artificial thumps. Understandably, none of the low frequency sounds were felt from the tiny driver. In summary, the loudspeaker on the Redmi 7 does the job if you’re with your friends and want to show them a new song you’ve recently discovered. The earpiece, on the other hand, could do with a bit more volume for calls., , , The Redmi 7 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 chipset. First announced in June last year, the chip has a 14-nanometre octa-core processor, which consists of four Kryo 250 Gold processor cores and four Kryo 250 Silver processor cores, all clocking at 1.8GHz. The budget Xiaomi phone is offered in two variants: one with 2GB of RAM (at Rs 7,999) and another with 3GB of RAM (at Rs 8,999). Our review unit was the latter. Internal storage on both variants is a standard 32GB. External storage in the form of a microSD card goes all the way up to 512GB., In our benchmark tests, the Redmi 7 review unit fared pretty well. On AnTuTu 7.0, it scored 104809. In comparison, the costlier Nokia 4.2 (with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 chipset and 3GB of RAM) scored 62985 in the same test. On Geekbench Single-Core and Multi-Core tests, the Redmi 7 bagged 1240 and 4370 respectively. In comparison, the Nokia 4.2 managed 894 and 3338 in the same two tests respectively., , In everyday use scenarios, the Redmi 7 review unit performed satisfactorily. Launching, minimising, closing, and switching between apps was a trouble-free experience. There was no visible sign of lag or delay while jumping between numerous tabs in Chrome or while multitasking in general. I was able to browse and play videos online even comfortably even where there was some background activity going on, like app installations and game updates. If anything, there was that occasional stutter in animation while minimising and jumping between apps. But these hiccups didn’t necessarily slow the phone down; they only exposed the GPU’s limitation., The Redmi 7 review unit scored 916 in 3DMark’s Sling Shot GPU benchmark test. In comparison, the Nokia 4.2 scored 821. During our gaming sessions, Asphalt 9 ran at a median frame rate of 29 frames per second on the Redmi 7. PUBG Mobile, on the other hand, ran on forced Low graphics settings at a median frame rate of 26 frames per second. During actual gameplay, some elements in Asphalt 9 (like the car’s spoiler) were slightly pixelated but the animation seemed mostly consistent and stutter-free. The metrics for Asphalt 9 and PUBG Mobile were recorded using GameBench. To sum it up, the Redmi 7 is not for serious gamers but isn't a terrible choice if you're looking to play popular titles like PUBG Mobile on a budget., , , The Redmi 7 comes with a dual camera setup on the back and a single selfie shooter in the front. The rear cameras consist of a 12-megapixel 1.25μm primary sensor with an aperture of f/2.2 and a 2-megapixel depth sensor for portrait shots. They’re accompanied by a single LED flash. The selfie shooter is an 8-megapixel 1.12μm sensor with an aperture of f/2.0. According to Xiaomi, the shooters on the back feature “AI” for scene detection, portrait mode, and a function called Beautify 4.0., , Photos taken through the Redmi 7’s primary rear camera in daylight appear to be rich in colour even if the colours are a tad bit on the warmer side. Photos taken through Portrait mode in daylight are rendered quite well without any glaring errors in blurring the foreground subject. Selfies come out bright in daylight but suffer from a fair amount of noise when taken indoors. The camera app is eager to “beautify” faces but the beauty level can be turned down or even switched off altogether. Lowlight photos shot through the primary camera are bright but appear distorted around sources of light. Lowlight selfies, on the other hand, suffer from a good amount of noise., , The default camera app is both easy to use and quick to react. Unlike the Nokia 4.2, whose default camera app is unbearably slow and ungainly, the Redmi 7 doesn’t suffer from unexpected stalls and hiccups while running the camera app. It even has options to take square photos (so they’re Instagram-ready) and a Pro mode (which allows digital tweaking of ISO speed, aperture, shutter speed, and white balance). To sum it up, the Redmi 7 churns out surprisingly respectable photos, given the phone’s modest price tag., Disclaimer: Photos below have been resized for the web.

The UI is fairly intuitive and easy to use for new and seasoned smartphone users alike. Like the previous iterations of the UI, MIUI 10 doesn’t have a definite app drawer; all the apps can be launched straight from the home screen. As an optional feature, MIUI comes with the latest form of gestures for navigation, which is identical to the one seen on iPhones and to the one Android Q is supposed to feature. It also comes with numerous theme and wallpaper options. Despite that and the many features MIUI brings (its own set of everyday tools, like a calendar, calculator, etc.), I am personally not a fan of MIUI for one big reason: it comes filled with a tonne of ads and bloatware., , The Redmi 7 sports a 4,000mAh non-removable battery. On our standard battery benchmark test, the review unit lasted 545 minutes, which exceeds the Nokia 4.2’s score by only 15 minutes on the same test. For your reference, the Nokia 4.2 sports a much smaller 3,000mAh battery. In everyday use scenarios, the Redmi 7 review unit lasted somewhere close to two full days on a single charge., During the tests, the phone was put through many sessions of web browsing, gaming, online video playback, and simultaneous app installs and downloads. Even after a day of medium-to-heavy use, the battery only fell from 100 to 60 percent. Leaving the phone unattended for nearly an entire day didn’t seem to have too big an impact on the battery (less than a 5-percent drop), which means standby battery consumption on the Redmi 7 is fairly meagre.

If anything, there was that occasional stutter in animation while minimising and jumping between apps. But these hiccups didn’t necessarily slow the phone down; they only exposed the GPU’s limitation., The Redmi 7 review unit scored 916 in 3DMark’s Sling Shot GPU benchmark test. In comparison, the Nokia 4.2 scored 821. During our gaming sessions, Asphalt 9 ran at a median frame rate of 29 frames per second on the Redmi 7. PUBG Mobile, on the other hand, ran on forced Low graphics settings at a median frame rate of 26 frames per second. During actual gameplay, some elements in Asphalt 9 (like the car’s spoiler) were slightly pixelated but the animation seemed mostly consistent and stutter-free. The metrics for Asphalt 9 and PUBG Mobile were recorded using GameBench. To sum it up, the Redmi 7 is not for serious gamers but isn't a terrible choice if you're looking to play popular titles like PUBG Mobile on a budget., , , The Redmi 7 comes with a dual camera setup on the back and a single selfie shooter in the front. The rear cameras consist of a 12-megapixel 1.25μm primary sensor with an aperture of f/2.2 and a 2-megapixel depth sensor for portrait shots. They’re accompanied by a single LED flash. The selfie shooter is an 8-megapixel 1.12μm sensor with an aperture of f/2.0. According to Xiaomi, the shooters on the back feature “AI” for scene detection, portrait mode, and a function called Beautify 4.0., , Photos taken through the Redmi 7’s primary rear camera in daylight appear to be rich in colour even if the colours are a tad bit on the warmer side. Photos taken through Portrait mode in daylight are rendered quite well without any glaring errors in blurring the foreground subject. Selfies come out bright in daylight but suffer from a fair amount of noise when taken indoors. The camera app is eager to “beautify” faces but the beauty level can be turned down or even switched off altogether. Lowlight photos shot through the primary camera are bright but appear distorted around sources of light. Lowlight selfies, on the other hand, suffer from a good amount of noise., , The default camera app is both easy to use and quick to react. Unlike the Nokia 4.2, whose default camera app is unbearably slow and ungainly, the Redmi 7 doesn’t suffer from unexpected stalls and hiccups while running the camera app. It even has options to take square photos (so they’re Instagram-ready) and a Pro mode (which allows digital tweaking of ISO speed, aperture, shutter speed, and white balance). To sum it up, the Redmi 7 churns out surprisingly respectable photos, given the phone’s modest price tag., Disclaimer: Photos below have been resized for the web.

In everyday use scenarios, the Redmi 7 review unit lasted somewhere close to two full days on a single charge., During the tests, the phone was put through many sessions of web browsing, gaming, online video playback, and simultaneous app installs and downloads. Even after a day of medium-to-heavy use, the battery only fell from 100 to 60 percent.

Where it falls short, sadly, is in the overall build quality. It’s a great buy nonetheless., , If it rained in New Delhi as often as Xiaomi launched a new smartphone model, the capital city would be a whole lot cooler, don’t you think? Only last month, the Chinese electronics giant launched two new budget models under the Redmi brand name (Redmi Y3 and Redmi 7) with one more to follow (Redmi 7A). A little before that, it launched the Redmi Go, Xiaomi’s cheapest smartphone as of today, with Android Go running the show. While the Redmi Y3 was picked up for a review by my esteemed colleague Subhrojit, the Redmi 7 found its way to me. Having bid goodbye to the rather likeable Nokia 4.2, I picked it up to give it a proper go., , Redmi 7 in Lunar Red, Labelling it “the ultimate all-rounder”, Xiaomi has blessed the Redmi 7 with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 chipset, up to 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of internal storage space as standard. The screen measures 6.26 inches diagonally and sports a “dot notch” at the top for the selfie camera. Starting at a price of Rs 7,999 at the time of writing this review, the Redmi 7 comes in three colour options: Eclipse Black, Comet Blue, and Lunar Red. The latter two come with a gradient finish on the back. Read on to see how our Lunar Red review unit fared., , Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, , The Redmi 7’s front face gets Corning Gorilla Glass 5 to protect the display against minor scratches, while the back panel gets what appears to be a regular glossy plastic panel (Xiaomi hasn’t disclosed any specifics). A black plastic beading keeps the two panels together and houses all the ports and buttons. According to Xiaomi, the Redmi 7’s body comes with a P2i nano-coating that makes it splash-resistant but not waterproof, so it goes without saying that it does not get an IP rating. What this means for you is that you can call your Ola driver under a light spell of rain but not expose the Redmi 7 to a swimming pool., , Back panel is a fingerprint magnet, Though the review unit appeared to be built fairly well, there was one critical detail that occurred to me the minute I held it up in my hand: the rear panel didn’t fit the plastic frame very well, leaving just a bit of its sharp edge exposed on one side. It wasn’t sharp enough to cut a finger running over it but the poor fit made me wonder if the panel would ever come off in the future or weaken the phone’s structure greatly. In terms of build alone, the Redmi 7 could do better., , Back panel on left edge was too sharp, A fair number of budget smartphones come with a gradient finish on the back panel these days and the Redmi 7 is no different. It gives the phone a bit of much-needed class. Sadly, the glossy front and back panels of the Redmi 7 act as a powerful magnet for fingerprints and smudges. The top side of the phone is home to a 3.5mm audio jack, a secondary microphone, and an IR blaster. The left side houses just the SIM/microSD card tray., , Shrey loves showing off the two-tone back panel of the Redmi 7, , 3.5mm audio jack and Xiaomi-standard IR blaster, The bottom side reveals a microUSB port (for charging and data transfer) and loudspeaker grilles on either side of the port. Predictably, sound emanates from only one of those two grilles. The right side gets the power button and a volume rocker, both of which are sturdy and tactile. On the back, we see a dual camera setup with a visible camera bump and a fingerprint scanner, which, although positioned way too high up, works well for screen unlocks., , No USB-C here, , Buttons feel good to press, , The IPS LCD screen on the Redmi 7 measures 6.26 inches diagonally. It has an aspect ratio of 19:9 and a resolution of 1520 x 720 pixels. According to Xiaomi, it has a contrast ratio of 1500:1 and a screen-to-body ratio of nearly 87 percent. The pixel density sits at a decent 269 pixels per inch. According to our test kit, the review unit’s screen brightness went all the way up to 353 LUX, which is the going figure for phones of its segment. In comparison, the recently launched Nokia 4.2's display brightness maxed out at 333 LUX. Colours on the screen appeared vivid but seemed to have a light cool tinge about them. Maximum horizontal viewing angle sat somewhere close to a respectable 170 degrees. Surprisingly, there was almost no indication of light bleed from the LCD panel's backlight. All in all, the Redmi 7's display is well worth its salt., , Sound from the single down-firing loudspeaker is both loud and clear. Songs like The Weeknd’s Starboy played with a surprising amount of clarity across all three frequencies on the review unit. Low frequency sounds too were reproduced in the form of mild artificial thumps. Understandably, none of the low frequency sounds were felt from the tiny driver. In summary, the loudspeaker on the Redmi 7 does the job if you’re with your friends and want to show them a new song you’ve recently discovered. The earpiece, on the other hand, could do with a bit more volume for calls., , , The Redmi 7 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 chipset. First announced in June last year, the chip has a 14-nanometre octa-core processor, which consists of four Kryo 250 Gold processor cores and four Kryo 250 Silver processor cores, all clocking at 1.8GHz. The budget Xiaomi phone is offered in two variants: one with 2GB of RAM (at Rs 7,999) and another with 3GB of RAM (at Rs 8,999). Our review unit was the latter. Internal storage on both variants is a standard 32GB. External storage in the form of a microSD card goes all the way up to 512GB., In our benchmark tests, the Redmi 7 review unit fared pretty well. On AnTuTu 7.0, it scored 104809. In comparison, the costlier Nokia 4.2 (with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 chipset and 3GB of RAM) scored 62985 in the same test. On Geekbench Single-Core and Multi-Core tests, the Redmi 7 bagged 1240 and 4370 respectively. In comparison, the Nokia 4.2 managed 894 and 3338 in the same two tests respectively., , In everyday use scenarios, the Redmi 7 review unit performed satisfactorily. Launching, minimising, closing, and switching between apps was a trouble-free experience. There was no visible sign of lag or delay while jumping between numerous tabs in Chrome or while multitasking in general. I was able to browse and play videos online even comfortably even where there was some background activity going on, like app installations and game updates.

According to Xiaomi, the Redmi 7’s body comes with a P2i nano-coating that makes it splash-resistant but not waterproof, so it goes without saying that it does not get an IP rating. What this means for you is that you can call your Ola driver under a light spell of rain but not expose the Redmi 7 to a swimming pool., , Back panel is a fingerprint magnet, Though the review unit appeared to be built fairly well, there was one critical detail that occurred to me the minute I held it up in my hand: the rear panel didn’t fit the plastic frame very well, leaving just a bit of its sharp edge exposed on one side. It wasn’t sharp enough to cut a finger running over it but the poor fit made me wonder if the panel would ever come off in the future or weaken the phone’s structure greatly. In terms of build alone, the Redmi 7 could do better., , Back panel on left edge was too sharp, A fair number of budget smartphones come with a gradient finish on the back panel these days and the Redmi 7 is no different. It gives the phone a bit of much-needed class. Sadly, the glossy front and back panels of the Redmi 7 act as a powerful magnet for fingerprints and smudges. The top side of the phone is home to a 3.5mm audio jack, a secondary microphone, and an IR blaster. The left side houses just the SIM/microSD card tray., , Shrey loves showing off the two-tone back panel of the Redmi 7, , 3.5mm audio jack and Xiaomi-standard IR blaster, The bottom side reveals a microUSB port (for charging and data transfer) and loudspeaker grilles on either side of the port. Predictably, sound emanates from only one of those two grilles. The right side gets the power button and a volume rocker, both of which are sturdy and tactile. On the back, we see a dual camera setup with a visible camera bump and a fingerprint scanner, which, although positioned way too high up, works well for screen unlocks., , No USB-C here, , Buttons feel good to press, , The IPS LCD screen on the Redmi 7 measures 6.26 inches diagonally. It has an aspect ratio of 19:9 and a resolution of 1520 x 720 pixels. According to Xiaomi, it has a contrast ratio of 1500:1 and a screen-to-body ratio of nearly 87 percent. The pixel density sits at a decent 269 pixels per inch. According to our test kit, the review unit’s screen brightness went all the way up to 353 LUX, which is the going figure for phones of its segment. In comparison, the recently launched Nokia 4.2's display brightness maxed out at 333 LUX. Colours on the screen appeared vivid but seemed to have a light cool tinge about them. Maximum horizontal viewing angle sat somewhere close to a respectable 170 degrees. Surprisingly, there was almost no indication of light bleed from the LCD panel's backlight. All in all, the Redmi 7's display is well worth its salt., , Sound from the single down-firing loudspeaker is both loud and clear. Songs like The Weeknd’s Starboy played with a surprising amount of clarity across all three frequencies on the review unit. Low frequency sounds too were reproduced in the form of mild artificial thumps. Understandably, none of the low frequency sounds were felt from the tiny driver. In summary, the loudspeaker on the Redmi 7 does the job if you’re with your friends and want to show them a new song you’ve recently discovered. The earpiece, on the other hand, could do with a bit more volume for calls., , , The Redmi 7 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 chipset. First announced in June last year, the chip has a 14-nanometre octa-core processor, which consists of four Kryo 250 Gold processor cores and four Kryo 250 Silver processor cores, all clocking at 1.8GHz. The budget Xiaomi phone is offered in two variants: one with 2GB of RAM (at Rs 7,999) and another with 3GB of RAM (at Rs 8,999). Our review unit was the latter. Internal storage on both variants is a standard 32GB. External storage in the form of a microSD card goes all the way up to 512GB., In our benchmark tests, the Redmi 7 review unit fared pretty well. On AnTuTu 7.0, it scored 104809. In comparison, the costlier Nokia 4.2 (with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 439 chipset and 3GB of RAM) scored 62985 in the same test. On Geekbench Single-Core and Multi-Core tests, the Redmi 7 bagged 1240 and 4370 respectively. In comparison, the Nokia 4.2 managed 894 and 3338 in the same two tests respectively., , In everyday use scenarios, the Redmi 7 review unit performed satisfactorily. Launching, minimising, closing, and switching between apps was a trouble-free experience. There was no visible sign of lag or delay while jumping between numerous tabs in Chrome or while multitasking in general. I was able to browse and play videos online even comfortably even where there was some background activity going on, like app installations and game updates. If anything, there was that occasional stutter in animation while minimising and jumping between apps. But these hiccups didn’t necessarily slow the phone down; they only exposed the GPU’s limitation., The Redmi 7 review unit scored 916 in 3DMark’s Sling Shot GPU benchmark test. In comparison, the Nokia 4.2 scored 821. During our gaming sessions, Asphalt 9 ran at a median frame rate of 29 frames per second on the Redmi 7. PUBG Mobile, on the other hand, ran on forced Low graphics settings at a median frame rate of 26 frames per second. During actual gameplay, some elements in Asphalt 9 (like the car’s spoiler) were slightly pixelated but the animation seemed mostly consistent and stutter-free. The metrics for Asphalt 9 and PUBG Mobile were recorded using GameBench. To sum it up, the Redmi 7 is not for serious gamers but isn't a terrible choice if you're looking to play popular titles like PUBG Mobile on a budget., , , The Redmi 7 comes with a dual camera setup on the back and a single selfie shooter in the front. The rear cameras consist of a 12-megapixel 1.25μm primary sensor with an aperture of f/2.2 and a 2-megapixel depth sensor for portrait shots. They’re accompanied by a single LED flash. The selfie shooter is an 8-megapixel 1.12μm sensor with an aperture of f/2.0. According to Xiaomi, the shooters on the back feature “AI” for scene detection, portrait mode, and a function called Beautify 4.0., , Photos taken through the Redmi 7’s primary rear camera in daylight appear to be rich in colour even if the colours are a tad bit on the warmer side. Photos taken through Portrait mode in daylight are rendered quite well without any glaring errors in blurring the foreground subject. Selfies come out bright in daylight but suffer from a fair amount of noise when taken indoors. The camera app is eager to “beautify” faces but the beauty level can be turned down or even switched off altogether. Lowlight photos shot through the primary camera are bright but appear distorted around sources of light. Lowlight selfies, on the other hand, suffer from a good amount of noise., , The default camera app is both easy to use and quick to react. Unlike the Nokia 4.2, whose default camera app is unbearably slow and ungainly, the Redmi 7 doesn’t suffer from unexpected stalls and hiccups while running the camera app. It even has options to take square photos (so they’re Instagram-ready) and a Pro mode (which allows digital tweaking of ISO speed, aperture, shutter speed, and white balance). To sum it up, the Redmi 7 churns out surprisingly respectable photos, given the phone’s modest price tag., Disclaimer: Photos below have been resized for the web.

The UI is fairly intuitive and easy to use for new and seasoned smartphone users alike. Like the previous iterations of the UI, MIUI 10 doesn’t have a definite app drawer; all the apps can be launched straight from the home screen. As an optional feature, MIUI comes with the latest form of gestures for navigation, which is identical to the one seen on iPhones and to the one Android Q is supposed to feature. It also comes with numerous theme and wallpaper options. Despite that and the many features MIUI brings (its own set of everyday tools, like a calendar, calculator, etc.), I am personally not a fan of MIUI for one big reason: it comes filled with a tonne of ads and bloatware., , The Redmi 7 sports a 4,000mAh non-removable battery. On our standard battery benchmark test, the review unit lasted 545 minutes, which exceeds the Nokia 4.2’s score by only 15 minutes on the same test. For your reference, the Nokia 4.2 sports a much smaller 3,000mAh battery. In everyday use scenarios, the Redmi 7 review unit lasted somewhere close to two full days on a single charge., During the tests, the phone was put through many sessions of web browsing, gaming, online video playback, and simultaneous app installs and downloads. Even after a day of medium-to-heavy use, the battery only fell from 100 to 60 percent. Leaving the phone unattended for nearly an entire day didn’t seem to have too big an impact on the battery (less than a 5-percent drop), which means standby battery consumption on the Redmi 7 is fairly meagre. The Redmi 7 should last you up to one and a half days even with fairly heavy use., The Redmi 7 offers a good load of value for its price. The budget Xiaomi phone does surprisingly well on the display and camera fronts. Its performance too is up to the mark. PUBG Mobile players on a budget should be quite happy with its ability to push pixels. All things considered, the Redmi 7 really is a fairly good all-rounder. What’s its Achilles heel then? Build quality, easily, especially on the back. I wish the edge of the rear panel didn’t threaten to scratch my finger every time I lifted the phone up."

Where it falls short, sadly, is in the overall build quality. It’s a great buy nonetheless., , If it rained in New Delhi as often as Xiaomi launched a new smartphone model, the capital city would be a whole lot cooler, don’t you think? Only last month, the Chinese electronics giant launched two new budget models under the Redmi brand name (Redmi Y3 and Redmi 7) with one more to follow (Redmi 7A). A little before that, it launched the Redmi Go, Xiaomi’s cheapest smartphone as of today, with Android Go running the show. While the Redmi Y3 was picked up for a review by my esteemed colleague Subhrojit, the Redmi 7 found its way to me. Having bid goodbye to the rather likeable Nokia 4.2, I picked it up to give it a proper go., , Redmi 7 in Lunar Red, Labelling it “the ultimate all-rounder”, Xiaomi has blessed the Redmi 7 with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 chipset, up to 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of internal storage space as standard. The screen measures 6.26 inches diagonally and sports a “dot notch” at the top for the selfie camera. Starting at a price of Rs 7,999 at the time of writing this review, the Redmi 7 comes in three colour options: Eclipse Black, Comet Blue, and Lunar Red.

2414,,xiaomi-redmi-note-6-pro-review-138337,0,0,2019-05-22,138337,Subhrojit Mallick,Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/xiaomi-redmi-note-6-pro-review-138337.html,"The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, despite being a reliable device, isn't the best smartphone in the mid-range segment anymore. Xiaomi frankly borrowed a leaf out of OnePlus' book and refined the popular Redmi Note 5 Pro, and didn't really upgrade it. And in the mid-range segment where loyalties shift with a bump in megapixels or RAM, the Redmi Note 6 Pro could be threatened by other, more powerful devices in that category. Read on to find out why. , , The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro comes just eight months after the launch of its predecessor, the Redmi Note 5 Pro. In a recent IDC report, Xiaomi remained in top of the Indian smartphone market and grew by an astonishing 27 percent. The chief drivers of the growth were the affordable Redmi 5A and the Redmi Note 5 Pro. When the Note 5 Pro  launched back in February 2018, it set a benchmark for performance in the mid-range segment by introducing the Snapdragon 636 alongside 6 gigs of RAM. No wonder it sold like hot cakes., Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, With the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, Xiaomi has done something that OnePlus is known to do. Xiaomi refreshed it’s best-selling offering in a short span of time, improving upon the usability with new software-based features, while leaving out a notable hardware upgrade. While that has worked out well for OnePlus so far in the high-end segment, the mid-range category is a whole different story. With the likes of the Realme 2 Pro, the Moto One Power, and Xiaomi’s own Mi A2 for company in that segment, the Redmi Note 6 Pro has a tough road ahead to glory., Will its follow-up, the Redmi Note 6 Pro live up to the same hype? More importantly, is it still the high performer? Let’s find out., The Redmi Note 6 Pro is basically the old Note 5 Pro, but with a notch cut-out in the display. As ugly as the notch looks, Xiaomi gave in to the growing demand of a larger, bezel-less display and the notch was the only way to give the people what they wanted. It doesn’t really help things here as the notch is rather wide and offers little space on either sides for icons and notifications. It’s also quite pesky and refuses to go if you’re playing a game like PubG unless you manually turn it off. The notch is present while you’re reading an article and but not when you’re watching a video on YouTube., 
Hello notch, my old friend! , Xiaomi’s design philosophy was once appreciated and even copied across the segment. One of the primary proponents of the metal-body design in the price-range, Xiaomi’s Redmi Note series popularised the design cues that are now present in almost all Xiaomi phones in the budget and mid-range segment. The company does experiment with other materials like ceramic in its flagship products and even kevlar like it did in the Poco F1. I can safely say the metal body design now looks plain boring. Heck, it’s now difficult to tell one Xiaomi phone apart from the other if you’re looking at them from the back. Despite that, one has to admit that these metal-bodied phones are anyday more durable than your glass-sandwich ones even though the latter looks much, much better. You’re anyway going to slap a case on it and if that’s the case, there’s no point calling Xiaomi out for using a recurring design if it’s made to last. But then, the Redmi Note 5 Pro unit we had received for review, doesn’t work all that well now. The power button on the right needs to be pressed harder to have it register. Hopefully, the Redmi Note 6 Pro has better internal construction and durability., 
The side bulges are the only thing distinctive in the design, While there’s hardly any major difference in the design of the Redmi Note 6 Pro, Xiaomi did introduce slightly curved edges on the back, with sides that bulge out from the body. It does help in gripping the phone better. The rounded corners also doesn’t let the phone dig into the palm. The dual-camera unit on the back is aligned vertically on the top left corner with the fingerprint sensor located centrally, right where the index finger can reach. The Redmi Note 6 Pro also shaved off the bezels from below, but only by a hair and unless you’re comparing the Note 6 Pro against the Note 5 Pro side-by-side, there’s no way to tell. It’s quite a big bezel though and phones like the Honor 8X are honestly a better alternative if a bezel-less display is what you’re looking for in a phone., I have mixed feelings about the Redmi Note 6 Pro’s design. At the fag end of the year, after using a bunch of Xiaomi devices that look all the same, I’ve grown tired of the reiteration. However, it’s durable and can take more scratches and bumps than a glass-bodied phone, and that should be a priority in the mid-range segment., This is where the Redmi Note 6 Pro primarily differs from the Redmi Note 5 Pro. The Note 6 Pro sports a larger 6.26-inch display that has an ugly notch on top, which is how Xiaomi increased the screen size without increasing the footprint of the phone. However, most of the extra screen real-estate is eaten up by the notch itself, and there’s hardly any space for the icons and notifications. The phone does offer the option to turn the notch off, but you have to do it manually by whitelisting apps. Videos are cut out in 16:9 aspect ratio by default and in apps like YouTube you can stretch it to 18:9 aspect ratio, but there will still be space left unused. The notch, like we have mentioned countless times, serves no purpose whatsoever, and should just go., 
Colours on the Redmi Note 6 Pro are a little more vibrant, Apart from that, the panel on the Redmi Note 6 Pro is of a higher quality than it’s predecessor. While the brightness levels are more or less the same (500 lux), colours are more vibrant and crisp on this one. The phone also offers options to tweak the white balance and colour temperature, but if you don’t know what you're doing, it’s better to maintain the default settings., This is where there’s hardly any difference in between the Redmi Note 6 Pro and it’s predecessor. All other Redmi Note phone have outperformed their respective predecessors in both benchmark tests and in real-world usage, but not this one. The Redmi Note 6 Pro relies on the same Snapdragon 636 SoC coupled with either 4GB or 6GB RAM,  along with 64GB storage. While the hardware configuration did excite us in the beginning of the year, by the end of 2018, it has become the standard. The Snapdragon 636, with it’s eight Kryo 260 cores clocked at 1.8GHz, is now aging quickly in the face of the Snapdragon 660 and the Kirin 710 being offered in the same price. The benchmark reports corroborate that., , , On AnTuTu, the Redmi Note 6 Pro scored 116046 against the Redmi Note 5 Pro’s 112652, while the Realme 2 Pro with a Snapdragon 660 outscored both of them with 128430 and the Mi A2 trumped even that score with 128895. With similar price points, it becomes an easy choice if you’re looking for the best performance. On Geekbench Single Core and Multi Core tests that puts the CPU capabilities to test, the Redmi Note 6 Pro scored 1632 and 3233 respectively. The scores are once again in line with the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1  and here again, the Realme 2 Pro and the Mi A2 outperformed the Note 6 Pro with significantly higher scores. Even on 3DMark Slingshot, which tests the graphics processing capabilities of a device, the scores are similar for both the Redmi Note 6 Pro and it’s predecessor while the Mi A2 and the Realme 2 Pro outscored it by a long margin., Based on the performance benchmark scores, it’s easy to see that the Redmi Note 6 Pro is not the best Xiaomi has to offer in that price. The Mi A2, with the Snapdragon 660 SoC and Android One-certified stock Android UI is what we would recommend, but if you’re married to the MIUI ecosystem, the Redmi Note 6 Pro is your next best option., In real-world usage, the difference in performance isn’t all that much. The phone runs MIUI 10 out of the box and it’s optimised brilliantly for the phone. I didn’t face any lag or stutter while opening apps, or browsing the internet. However, the MIUI 10 interface on this phone is based on Android 8.1 Oreo and not the latest Android version. The new update brings gesture-based navigation and a new recent apps menu which is more card-based and arranged vertically. There’s support for autofill now, and a new app management system in Settings. More than that, MIUI feels fast and snappy with quick animations. The phone also boots quickly in around 30 seconds and apps launch slightly faster than the Note 5 Pro., 
PubG Mobile is playable on this phone, Gaming on the Redmi Note 6 Pro is not the best experience. Most games will run although the graphically-demanding ones have to be played in low or medium settings. We played PubG Mobile on the Redmi Note 6 Pro with GameBench plugged in, and it recorded a stable FPS of 25. On flagships like the OnePlus 6T, you get around 40 FPS. While FPS count isn’t as much as what flagships offer, you do get stable gameplay with a variability index of 1 FPS on an average across five sessions we tested., , Courtesy: Gamebench, It goes without saying that even though this isn’t the fastest phone in the mid-range segment by any means, it’s fairly reliable and functional and will not let you down., The Redmi Note 6 Pro while not offering any upgrades in raw performance, ups the ante when it comes to imaging. The phone’s dual camera unit at the back is better thanks to a bigger sensor with larger 1.4um pixels and a wider f/1.9 aperture as compared to that on the Redmi Note 5 Pro. On the front, inside that ugly notch are two sensors as well for selfies. The secondary sensor, like that on the rear, is used for calculating the depth of field., , 12+5MP dual camera with bigger sensors and wider aperture, , The notch houses dual front cameras , The camera on the Redmi Note 6 Pro is much better than the Redmi Note 5 Pro’s. In the day as well as in low-light, the Redmi Note 6 Pro takes images that are aesthetically pleasing. The camera relies on machine learning to recognise scenes across 32 categories including buildings, greenery, animals, people, etc. The AI mode is turned off by default and once you turn it on, it automatically recognises what you’re shooting within 1-2 seconds, but what it’s actually doing after recognising is not clear. In some instances, like shooting foliage, the greens do look more vibrant while low-light photos are processed using noise-reduction algorithms. But there’s no real clarity on what the AI is doing in reality. But to cut things short, the Redmi Note 6 Pro can take good photos that are sharp, vibrant and are visually appealing., , , , , For more image samples, check out our Flickr Gallery. , We did an article after testing the camera extensively where we concluded the camera on the Redmi Note 6 Pro is more than capable of taking good photos, and is much better than that on the Redmi Note 5 Pro. But the Mi A2 trumps it in low-light with its pixel-binning technique. The Note 6 Pro applies the same technique for selfies with its 20+2MP front camera and the selfies do come out better in low-light because of it., , , Further, the Note 6 Pro offers a new experience of portrait mode with dynamic bokeh. The blurred part warps into different shapes and if you ask me, I found them pretty cool. The phone also has various lighting effects and thankfully, Xiaomi’s implementation works much better than what the Realme 2 Pro or the Honor 8X offers., Overall, the Redmi Note 6 Pro’s primary claim to fame is the camera. That’s where most of the work has gone in developing the phone., 
What a day-and-a-half battery life looks like, The Redmi Note 6 Pro with its 4,000mAh battery offers the same one and a half day battery life like its predecessor. While we would have liked a bigger battery on the phone like the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1, this one is more than enough to last the entire day. What’s disappointing is that Xiaomi offers a 5V charger out of the box that can’t fast-charge the device. It still uses a micro-USB port to charge even when the Mi A2, offered at nearly the same price has a USB-Type C port. The battery drain while playing PubG was around 15 percent for a full 30-minute session which isn’t all that bad considering other phones also have similar drainage pattern., The Redmi Note 6 Pro, like we noted before is no longer a leader in the mid-range segment. With underwhelming performance, and a lacklustre design, it’s now a follower. It’s still offers good value for your money though, it’s just not the best, which is what we expect from Redmi’s Note lineup anyway. The Note 6 Pro somewhat redeems itself with good imaging prowess, but if you’re looking for an out-and-out performer, the Realme 2 Pro or the Honor 8X are phones you can consider. Or if you have to stick to Xiaomi and can make do with stock Android, the Mi A2 is a no-brainer. To be frank, I couldn’t find a legit reason to recommend the Note 6 Pro apart from the high value for money. In the mid-range segment where spec-sheets rule the roost and design slowly getting noticed, Xiaomi could have spent a few more months and followed up the popular Redmi Note 5 Pro with a worthy successor."
2414,,xiaomi-redmi-note-6-pro-review-138337,0,0,2019-05-22,138337,Subhrojit Mallick,Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/xiaomi-redmi-note-6-pro-review-138337.html,"The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, despite being a reliable device, isn't the best smartphone in the mid-range segment anymore. Xiaomi frankly borrowed a leaf out of OnePlus' book and refined the popular Redmi Note 5 Pro, and didn't really upgrade it. And in the mid-range segment where loyalties shift with a bump in megapixels or RAM, the Redmi Note 6 Pro could be threatened by other, more powerful devices in that category. Read on to find out why. , , The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro comes just eight months after the launch of its predecessor, the Redmi Note 5 Pro. In a recent IDC report, Xiaomi remained in top of the Indian smartphone market and grew by an astonishing 27 percent. The chief drivers of the growth were the affordable Redmi 5A and the Redmi Note 5 Pro. When the Note 5 Pro  launched back in February 2018, it set a benchmark for performance in the mid-range segment by introducing the Snapdragon 636 alongside 6 gigs of RAM. No wonder it sold like hot cakes., Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Realme 3 Pro Review, Huawei P30 Pro 256GB Review, With the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, Xiaomi has done something that OnePlus is known to do. Xiaomi refreshed it’s best-selling offering in a short span of time, improving upon the usability with new software-based features, while leaving out a notable hardware upgrade. While that has worked out well for OnePlus so far in the high-end segment, the mid-range category is a whole different story. With the likes of the Realme 2 Pro, the Moto One Power, and Xiaomi’s own Mi A2 for company in that segment, the Redmi Note 6 Pro has a tough road ahead to glory., Will its follow-up, the Redmi Note 6 Pro live up to the same hype? More importantly, is it still the high performer? Let’s find out., The Redmi Note 6 Pro is basically the old Note 5 Pro, but with a notch cut-out in the display. As ugly as the notch looks, Xiaomi gave in to the growing demand of a larger, bezel-less display and the notch was the only way to give the people what they wanted. It doesn’t really help things here as the notch is rather wide and offers little space on either sides for icons and notifications. It’s also quite pesky and refuses to go if you’re playing a game like PubG unless you manually turn it off. The notch is present while you’re reading an article and but not when you’re watching a video on YouTube., 
Hello notch, my old friend! , Xiaomi’s design philosophy was once appreciated and even copied across the segment. One of the primary proponents of the metal-body design in the price-range, Xiaomi’s Redmi Note series popularised the design cues that are now present in almost all Xiaomi phones in the budget and mid-range segment. The company does experiment with other materials like ceramic in its flagship products and even kevlar like it did in the Poco F1. I can safely say the metal body design now looks plain boring. Heck, it’s now difficult to tell one Xiaomi phone apart from the other if you’re looking at them from the back. Despite that, one has to admit that these metal-bodied phones are anyday more durable than your glass-sandwich ones even though the latter looks much, much better. You’re anyway going to slap a case on it and if that’s the case, there’s no point calling Xiaomi out for using a recurring design if it’s made to last. But then, the Redmi Note 5 Pro unit we had received for review, doesn’t work all that well now. The power button on the right needs to be pressed harder to have it register. Hopefully, the Redmi Note 6 Pro has better internal construction and durability., 
The side bulges are the only thing distinctive in the design, While there’s hardly any major difference in the design of the Redmi Note 6 Pro, Xiaomi did introduce slightly curved edges on the back, with sides that bulge out from the body. It does help in gripping the phone better. The rounded corners also doesn’t let the phone dig into the palm. The dual-camera unit on the back is aligned vertically on the top left corner with the fingerprint sensor located centrally, right where the index finger can reach. The Redmi Note 6 Pro also shaved off the bezels from below, but only by a hair and unless you’re comparing the Note 6 Pro against the Note 5 Pro side-by-side, there’s no way to tell. It’s quite a big bezel though and phones like the Honor 8X are honestly a better alternative if a bezel-less display is what you’re looking for in a phone., I have mixed feelings about the Redmi Note 6 Pro’s design. At the fag end of the year, after using a bunch of Xiaomi devices that look all the same, I’ve grown tired of the reiteration. However, it’s durable and can take more scratches and bumps than a glass-bodied phone, and that should be a priority in the mid-range segment., This is where the Redmi Note 6 Pro primarily differs from the Redmi Note 5 Pro. The Note 6 Pro sports a larger 6.26-inch display that has an ugly notch on top, which is how Xiaomi increased the screen size without increasing the footprint of the phone. However, most of the extra screen real-estate is eaten up by the notch itself, and there’s hardly any space for the icons and notifications. The phone does offer the option to turn the notch off, but you have to do it manually by whitelisting apps. Videos are cut out in 16:9 aspect ratio by default and in apps like YouTube you can stretch it to 18:9 aspect ratio, but there will still be space left unused. The notch, like we have mentioned countless times, serves no purpose whatsoever, and should just go., 
Colours on the Redmi Note 6 Pro are a little more vibrant, Apart from that, the panel on the Redmi Note 6 Pro is of a higher quality than it’s predecessor. While the brightness levels are more or less the same (500 lux), colours are more vibrant and crisp on this one. The phone also offers options to tweak the white balance and colour temperature, but if you don’t know what you're doing, it’s better to maintain the default settings., This is where there’s hardly any difference in between the Redmi Note 6 Pro and it’s predecessor. All other Redmi Note phone have outperformed their respective predecessors in both benchmark tests and in real-world usage, but not this one. The Redmi Note 6 Pro relies on the same Snapdragon 636 SoC coupled with either 4GB or 6GB RAM,  along with 64GB storage. While the hardware configuration did excite us in the beginning of the year, by the end of 2018, it has become the standard. The Snapdragon 636, with it’s eight Kryo 260 cores clocked at 1.8GHz, is now aging quickly in the face of the Snapdragon 660 and the Kirin 710 being offered in the same price. The benchmark reports corroborate that., , , On AnTuTu, the Redmi Note 6 Pro scored 116046 against the Redmi Note 5 Pro’s 112652, while the Realme 2 Pro with a Snapdragon 660 outscored both of them with 128430 and the Mi A2 trumped even that score with 128895. With similar price points, it becomes an easy choice if you’re looking for the best performance. On Geekbench Single Core and Multi Core tests that puts the CPU capabilities to test, the Redmi Note 6 Pro scored 1632 and 3233 respectively. The scores are once again in line with the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1  and here again, the Realme 2 Pro and the Mi A2 outperformed the Note 6 Pro with significantly higher scores. Even on 3DMark Slingshot, which tests the graphics processing capabilities of a device, the scores are similar for both the Redmi Note 6 Pro and it’s predecessor while the Mi A2 and the Realme 2 Pro outscored it by a long margin., Based on the performance benchmark scores, it’s easy to see that the Redmi Note 6 Pro is not the best Xiaomi has to offer in that price. The Mi A2, with the Snapdragon 660 SoC and Android One-certified stock Android UI is what we would recommend, but if you’re married to the MIUI ecosystem, the Redmi Note 6 Pro is your next best option., In real-world usage, the difference in performance isn’t all that much. The phone runs MIUI 10 out of the box and it’s optimised brilliantly for the phone. I didn’t face any lag or stutter while opening apps, or browsing the internet. However, the MIUI 10 interface on this phone is based on Android 8.1 Oreo and not the latest Android version. The new update brings gesture-based navigation and a new recent apps menu which is more card-based and arranged vertically. There’s support for autofill now, and a new app management system in Settings. More than that, MIUI feels fast and snappy with quick animations. The phone also boots quickly in around 30 seconds and apps launch slightly faster than the Note 5 Pro., 
PubG Mobile is playable on this phone, Gaming on the Redmi Note 6 Pro is not the best experience. Most games will run although the graphically-demanding ones have to be played in low or medium settings. We played PubG Mobile on the Redmi Note 6 Pro with GameBench plugged in, and it recorded a stable FPS of 25. On flagships like the OnePlus 6T, you get around 40 FPS.

2203,,xiaomi-redmi-y1-review-69891,0,0,2019-05-22,69891,Hardik Singh,Xiaomi Redmi Y1 32 GB Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/xiaomi-redmi-y1-review-69891.html,"The Xiaomi Redmi Y1 is now the best phone for selfie lovers with a budget of under Rs. 10,000. It is a decent performer and has the same qualities we have seen on other Xiaomi phones. The only real compromise is in build quality.,  , , Xiaomi is one of the most prominent names in the budget market. The company has multiple options available for its customers, starting from Rs. 5,000. Among these is the relatively new (launched last month) Xiaomi Redmi Y1 smartphone. This is the company’s first foray into the selfie-centric smartphone market, which is primarily dominated by Oppo, Vivo and Gionee. However, with a price tag of just Rs. 8,999, the phone is squarely aimed at the budget-centric audience. For this phone, the company has reused the guts of its Redmi 4 smartphone and added some new features, to strike the right balance between good selfie cameras and pocket friendliness. Has it worked? Well, Let’s find out., Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, , Front facing camera: Best in class
The 16MP front facing camera with f/2.0 aperture lens is the main party trick. And this new camera does quite well. In fact, in a recent comparison between the selfies taken from this phone and the significantly more expensive Oppo F5, we established that the Redmi Y1 does hold its own. If we break it down further though, the phone does a good job when taking images in natural or ample lighting conditions. The camera captures decent amount of details but has a tendency to add a warm tone to all these images. Being a front facing camera, images turn out softer in comparison to a rear camera. So, details are noticeably low., ,  , Images taken in low light are about average and carry little details with decent colour reproduction. Images have high levels of noise the front facing flash doesn’t help either. That being said, you won’t find anything better at this price point, which inadvertently makes the Redmi Y1 better than the rest., Rear camera: Nothing great
As for the 13MP rear shooter, we are disappointed to see that the image quality here has dropped, compared to the Redmi 4. That’s likely because of the smaller f/2.2 aperture. The overall image quality is not significantly different, but we would argue that it shouldn’t be different at all. , , , , In ample lighting conditions, the Redmi Y1 captures decent details and colour saturation levels are fine as well. The camera, however, does not address the low dynamic range issue we pointed out in our Redmi 4 review, and shadow details are still lost. Furthermore, images shot at night don’t have a lot of detail, thanks to the camera’s reduced aperture. The phone also requires a rather steady hand to click low light images in HDR mode, as it takes quite a bit of times to capture images in this mode., , , , Build and Design: Pedestrian
To keep the prices low, Xiaomi cut some costs here and instead of the usual metallic or metal-like builds, the Redmi Y1 is made out of plastic. Yes, you do get a metal finish and a metal frame inside, but the body is susceptible to scratches and bumps. Our review unit has developed a minor creaking sound in just a couple of weeks of usage. If you forego all that though, the Redmi Y1 seems like any budget phone you may have encountered in the wild. The phone does not look particularly smart and the rather boring design has become more of a staple (safe) choice for many. We also don’t like the fact that the three navigation keys below the display are not backlit (still), which in 2017 is rather disappointing. , , Display and UI: As expected
Adding to the design is the 5.5-inch IPS LCD display. While the display offers a 720p resolution only, it does not look inferior to any of its competitors. Our testing reveals that Xiaomi has done a better job with this display, compared to the Redmi 4, even with the reduced pixel density. The Redmi Y1’s display looks more natural, compared to the oversaturated tones on the Redmi 4. Though many may prefer the warmer display on the Redmi 4, we personally like the Y1’s colour tones., , That said, the legibility under sunlight is not the best. Same goes for the viewing angles, which are good but there is a slight colour shift at extreme angles. Videos, games and text on the display look plenty sharp and with reasonable contrast. , With this phone, Xiaomi also introduced MIUI 9 in India. The phone was launched with a beta build and now in its stable form, it is just as good and functional as MIUI8. Apart from some new animations, the new UI brings support for split screen apps, bundled app notifications and new editing mode built inside the gallery app. Xiaomi’s Mi drop feature is now available as a separate app and is quite handy for transferring files to other devices. However, on the latest stable build, Xiaomi has not included the new Mi Video app, as well as the shortcut homescreen. Both of which were showcased at the launch last month. As of now, the calendar app also remains the same. , , Performance: Deja vu
Inside the device is a tried and tested Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 SoC and since you get the phone in 3GB and 4GB variants, its performance is similar to the Redmi 4 as well. This combination of hardware and software allows the phone to run smoothly through the day. Some apps may take a second or two to load, but overall the in-app experience is quite good. The phone even handles heavy games, like Asphalt 8 and Injustice 2 without much hassle. The loading time can be long sometimes, but that is something we were expecting at this price. Continuous gaming or shooting 1080p videos with the phone does make the device a tad warm. However, it didn't get uncomfortably hot during our use., , , , Apart from raw performance, the phone has decent sound output via headphones, with special attention given to bass. The same can’t be said about the bottom speaker. It is however reasonably loud., , We also liked the fact that Xiaomi has been listening to its customers, adding a dedicated SD card slot on this phone. This means you can use your secondary Jio SIM without running out of storage. Moreover, the IR blaster is always a welcome extra., Battery life: Good enough
As we mentioned before, Xiaomi has made some compromises to meet the budget and one of those is the battery life. Instead of the large 4100mAh battery pack the Redmi 4 features, the Y1 makes do with just a 3080mAh battery. That said, in our usage we didn’t find the battery life limiting and it did last us about a full work day almost every day. You can run out of battery easily if you are gaming for long hours, or watch a lot of content on Netflix or YouTube. Once discharged, the phone can be charged to the brim in less than two hours and if you are paranoid, just turn on the battery saver mode in the settings to delay the run to the wall socket., , Bottomline
Overall then, the Xiaomi Redmi Y1 is in essence a Redmi 4 that swaps out some features to make way for others. The biggest addition here is the 16MP front facing camera, which is simply the best at it's price. We don't have any complaints about the performance per se, but we do feel that build quality could have been better. It’s not particularly bad, but we’re used to better designed phones from Xiaomi., Overall, if you are crazy about selfies and can't extend your budget, the Redmi Y1 is a good option. If not, the tried and tested Redmi 4 is still hard to beat."

The biggest addition here is the 16MP front facing camera, which is simply the best at it's price. We don't have any complaints about the performance per se, but we do feel that build quality could have been better. It’s not particularly bad, but we’re used to better designed phones from Xiaomi., Overall, if you are crazy about selfies and can't extend your budget, the Redmi Y1 is a good option. If not, the tried and tested Redmi 4 is still hard to beat."

It may not be as powerful as its rivals, but that doesn't deter the Redmi Y2 to cover the basics right. , , The market for selfie-centric phones has been booming in India ever since Oppo, Vivo and the likes started positioning their phones around their front cameras. A lot has been done to enhance the quality of selfies  — AI beautification, dual cameras, portrait mode and what not. Xiaomi too jumped into the selfie bandwagon with the Y series last year. Aimed at the selfie-crazy youth, the Redmi Y1 last year was quite the hit. So it’s no surprise that Xiaomi launched a successor. Named the Redmi Y2, it is essentially a rebranding of the Redmi S2 launched just a few weeks earlier in China. But there’s more going for the Redmi Y2 than just a good front camera., Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review, Smartphones under the Rs 10,000 price barrier which we usually call budget or entry-level phones are the soft cookies among more expensive giants. They are fairly capable of offering similar hassle-free performance and pack a few trending features. That’s particularly because last year’s mid-range hardware is now affordable enough to be found in budget phones. The same carries for the Redmi Y2. With last year’s popular Snapdragon 625 running the show, the Redmi Y2 seems reliable on paper. But the world has moved on to other more powerful processors so does the new Xiaomi incumbent keep up with its rivals? We find out., Design, The Redmi Y2 is a typical Xiaomi device. Xiaomi’s design philosophy has become so diluted among phones in all and every price range that it’s both easy and hard to identify the phone. Easy because you’ll immediately know it’s a Mi phone and hard because you won’t be able to tell which one. Thankfully, there are some subtle differentiating features on the Redmi Y2. The antenna lines on the back are no longer a plastic cap that are evident to be distinctly different from the body. Instead, they are etched in the metal body itself which increases the visual appeal of the phone. Furthermore, where most phones use a 2.5D glass to offer that bulge along the edges for good grip, the Redmi Y2 does that with the metal body itself. The display is a little raised from the body and the edges bulge out to meet the screen. This bulge, Xiaomi says, renders more protection to the display and it gives good grip. That may be true, but the implementation makes it look like two different phones from the back and the front. Especially with the gold and white colour variant. This sort of break in design continuity isn’t signature Xiaomi and is quite the departure from the consistent design that we have come to expect from the company., , Apart from these subtle differences, the Redmi Y2 looks identical to the Redmi Note 5 Pro. The front is mostly taken up by the 18:9 display although there are distinct bezels on the top and the bottom. The rear panel is polished to give a smooth grip without being slippery. There’s the fingerprint sensor in the centre while the vertically dual cameras stick out from the corner. The bump is not as much but significant enough to be noticeable when placing the phone on a flat surface. You get a single bottom firing speaker that does get loud and a micro-USB port. The choice of port, Xiaomi claims is because it’s aimed for the masses who still use the older chargers. But that’s an excuse from the past. There is a major push for wider adoption of the Type-C standards and it’s high time companies started offering it in devices used by the masses., , The Redmi Y2 has a predictable, but reliable design. It doesn’t have the bling of the Realme 1, neither does it have the premium glass body of the Honor 9 Lite. It’s the typical Xiaomi design we’ve been seeing in Redmi phones for more than a year now., Display, The Redmi Y2’s focus is on selfies. For that, it has a powerful camera up front. But the company misses out on the fact that a good display is just as essential to the selfie-taking experience as the camera. The front camera shoots the selfie. The display lets the person see how she/he will look. It’s absolutely integral to know whether the effects of the beautification and the lights and shadows will be balanced. But the one on the Redmi Y2 doesn’t impress. It has a 720x1440 pixel 5.99-inch display with 18:9 aspect ratio. While the screen real estate is right up there with most other mid-range phones these days, the resolution leaves a lot to be desired. The visuals appear soft with a distinct lack of detail. The peak brightness isn’t enough for text to be legible under direct sunlight and the minimum brightness is still high enough to give off a glare in the dark., , MIUI’s punchy bright colours help though. The experience while browsing the phone isn’t that bad. But when you’re checking a photo or watching a video or even while playing a game, the low resolution is apparent. Still, the extra real estate means multi-tasking is easier, so is reading text. Most apps these days have adopted to the new display aspect ratio which is a good thing.,  , Performance and UI, The Redmi Y2’s aim is not to provide the firepower the enthusiasts desire. It needs just enough to impress the selfie-taker. Launch the camera quickly, shoot without any lag and have the battery last at least a full day. Considering this, the Snapdragon 625 is the apt choice for the phone. It was last year’s processor of choice for mid-range phones, especially for Xiaomi. The chipset is built on a 14nm FinFET process has been hailed for its power efficiency and reliable performance. The fact that it is now brought down to the budget segment is even more heartening.,  , But the world has moved on. Chipsets like the Kirin 659, the Snapdragon 630 and the Helio P60 are much better at handling performance and battery. The Helio P60 even has a discrete AI processor inside. With so much advancements, the Snapdragon 625 is visibly slower at least on synthetic benchmarks. When pitted against the competition, it failed to keep up. On Geekbench 4 Single Core, the Redmi Y2 scored 792 while on multi-core it scored 3,400. Both numbers are much lesser when compared to phones like the Realme 1, Redmi 5 and Honor 7X. On 3D Mark’s Sling Shot, the Redmi Y2 got a score 785, once again much lower than the competition. The story is the same for every benchmark that we ran. Read the chart below:
 , But like always, synthetic benchmarks dont give the full story. In real world usage, the Redmi Y2 is quick’, slick and smooth. Xiaomi has tuned its MIUI interface to work well with older chipsets and that shows. The interface can be swift and without any glitches. We didn’t experience any arbitrary app crashes or hiccups. The camera also opened quickly, which is essential in a selfie-centric phone., The weakness starts showing up when gaming. Games like PubG work in low graphics and there were expected frame drops while playing. It also took some time for the phone to load the environment which isn’t a good thing in first person shooters. Needless to say, the graphics aren’t going to impress enthusiasts., The phone runs on the latest Android 8.1 Oreo with MIUI 9.5 on top. It’s pleasantly surprising to see a Xiaomi phone running on the latest Android out of the box. The pressure of its competitors launching phones with the latest Android seems to be getting to Xiaomi, I suppose. MIUI 9.5 brings a lot of new features including a revamped notification shade, app lock, Mi Drop, but more importantly, it introduces gesture-based navigation. It’s a lot like the iPhone X.  You swipe up to go back, swipe up and hold down to get to the recents menu and swipe up from the center to go home. The gestures are fairly easy to learn and doesn’t take long to become muscle memory., Camera, The reason why the Redmi Y2 exists in the first place is because of its imaging prowess. The Y2 is regarded as a selfie expert with a 16-megapixel front camera. Interestingly, there’s a lot going in the front camera than your usual AI beautification marketing-speak. Xiaomi said it’s using pixel binning to improve selfies. The feature is used on much more expensive phones like the Huawei P20 Pro and the older Nokia Lumia 1020. Essentially, pixel binning combines adjacent pixels to create one single pixel that is larger than the rest. What that does is increase the signal to noise ratio so that more details are caught along with reducing digital noise. But usually, pixel binning reduces the effective resolution of the image, but in this case, Xiaomi converts the image back to 16-megapixel., , But does that make a big difference in selfies? Yes and no. It does improve on the details captured by the camera. The edges are much more consistent and colours are more vibrant. But it doesn’t solve the inherent problems with front cameras; highlight clipping and wonky exposure. In its bid to enhance facial details, the camera of the Y2 often blows up the background exposure. The dynamic range also isn’t as high to record details both in shadows and highlights., , To be honest, the rear camera has more going for the Y2 than the front. The resulting images come out nice and warm, a typical Xiaomi signature. Xiaomi tells me the Y2 uses the same hardware as the more expensive Redmi Note 5 Pro. A 12-megapixel primary sensor and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. Despite that, the quality isn’t the same. That doesn’t mean they’re bad. It’s still more richer than other phones at that price range., , , Photos shot in regular daylight can be compared to more expensive mid-range phones. You get a well-balanced exposure with a quick focus on the subject. The dynamic range is good enough for phones at that price and lights and shadows are balanced quite well., , , The Y2 is quite capable of taking close-up shots too. Bring the camera closer to the subject and the focus is locked with ease. The details are quite sharp with a distinct depth of field that comes out naturally., , Indoors, the camera starts to show its weakness. The area where the light is, is often overexposed. You also have to keep the shutter open for longer which results in shaky images. That becomes even more apparent when taking low-light shots. In that case, there’s more noise and less details, ., As for the portrait mode, it would be unfair to expect the quality of flagship phones. But for what it’s worth, the Y2 handles portraits quite well. The edges are consistently blurred and the background isn’t that out of focus that the subject looks like a cutout., Battery, The Redmi Y2, with its selfie-centric DNA demands good battery life. But Xiaomi, while focusing on the front camera, missed out giving the Y2 llong battery life. It’s 3,080mAH battery last just about a day. The phone lasted around 5 hours 16 minutes on PC Mark’s Work 2.0 battery test which means it will last just around a day for the average user. In the real world, the drain is not so drastic. I used the phone to browse the web, browse social media, reply to messages and take photos apart from listening to music. I had to charge the phone again at night. Sadly, there’s no fast charging and you will have to wait more than an hour and a half to top up the battery., Bottomline, The Redmi Y2 may be confusing to a buyer. The phone is priced similar to both the Redmi 5 and the Redmi Note 5. In fact, it has the same internals as the Redmi Note 5. But Xiaomi’s intentions are clear. The Note 5 is for enthusiasts while the Redmi 5 is for compact phone lovers. The Redmi Y2, hence, is for selfie lovers. Its front camera tech sets it apart from the rest, although the results are more or less consistent among other products by Xiaomi. The main threat for the Redmi Y2 is not from its own siblings though, but from its rivals. The Realme 1 is shaping up to be a compelling device with high-end hardware while the new Honor 7C and 7A are also proving to be reliable. The Redmi Y2 doesn’t bring anything groundbreaking to the table. It’s bland, but functional."

2491,,xiaomi-redmi-y3-review-181511,0,0,2019-05-22,181511,Subhrojit Mallick,Xiaomi Redmi Y3 Review,https://www.digit.in/reviews/mobile-phones/xiaomi-redmi-y3-review-181511.html,"The Redmi Y3 has a clear-cut mission — Make selfies great again. It’s weapon of choice is a 32MP camera on the front which while preserving facial details has the tendency to blow up the highlights. The advantages of a high-res camera, however, isn’t as apparent as in the case of the Redmi Note 7 Pro’s 48MP rear camera, especially in low-light. Switch to the binned mode and it'll be apparent why the Redmi Y3 is a solid selfie shooter. Surprisingly, the Redmi Y3 seems fairly adept at handling popular mobile games as the gaming performance revealed. Frankly, the Redmi Y3 is a mixed-bag with a few trade-offs here and there. But if you’re not a nitpicker when it comes to choosing your smartphone, this is an easy smartphone to recommend if good selfies are particularly what you’re after., , If the Redmi Note 7 Pro is focused around the rear camera, the Redmi Y3 is its polar opposite with a strong focus on the selfie camera. The two smartphones are even priced similarly making it clear that if you want a selfie phone, the Redmi Y3 is the one to go for while the Note 7 Pro is for everything else. But selfies aren’t the only thing one can do with a phone. The Redmi Y2 last year addressed this quite well with decent performance mixed with a decent cameras on both sides. Can the Redmi Y3 repeat the feat? Let’s find out., Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, , The Redmi Y3, at first glance looks a lot like the Redmi Note 7 Pro. It has a similar gradient colour design with a dual tone finish in both blue and red as well as a standard black finish. However, there are subtle differences in the design between the two. The Redmi Y3’s gradient dual tone has vertical stripes running down the rear panel with the shade of colour changing after each line. It’s also more curved around the edges and rounded in the corners. Furthermore, unlike the Note 7 Pro, the Redmi Y3 is made of polycarbonate which handles fingerprints quite fine, but retains smudges and sweat marks easily. The frame also seems to be made of plastic but with a smooth polish which lends a feeling of sturdiness. The buttons however feel wobbly and could be the first thing that stops functioning after prolonged use., , The front fascia is layered with Gorilla Glass 5 protecting the LCD display. The display itself takes up most of the real estate but leaves enough space around the edges, so it’s not particularly a bezel-less display even though the screen-to-body ratio is impressive at 86.7 percent. This is possible because of the smaller U-shaped notch that houses the front camera and other sensors leaving more space for status bar icons on top of the display., Overall, the Redmi Y3’s design looks good but I’m afraid the gradient colour design has been done to death over the past year and soon enough, the Y3’s unique look might become mainstream., , 
The Redmi Y3 sports a 6.26-inch IPS LCD display with only HD+ resolution. That’s a marked departure from the superior display you get with the Redmi Note 7 Pro by spending just Rs 1000 more. Phones priced above Rs 10,000 are expected to come with a fullHD display and in this regard, the Y3 disappoints. It gets more problematic when you realise the Y3 also doesn’t have the required DRM certification to stream content in HD. Instead, premium content from Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hotstar will run at 540p, marring the viewing experience even more., While gaming, the lower resolution becomes more apparent. The texture quality of objects in PUBG Mobile come across as jagged and grainy. However, reading text and watching short videos on Facebook are a good enough experience., , The sunlight legibility is also questionable. Out in the strong sun, the Redmi Y3’s display was barely visible even at full brightness. We clocked peak brightness of 373 lux and a minimum brightness of 5 lux which is lower than what most phones in that price range scored in our tests., , , The phone does give you the option to tweak the colour temperature as well as play around with display contrast. The night mode in the phone is called Reading mode and does exactly the same as other blue-light filters. You can also increase the size of the text and turn on ‘double tap to wake’ to reduce dependence on the wobbly power button., , The Redmi Y3 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 632. It’s Qualcomm’s most basic mid-range chipset available right now, so naturally there’s not a lot that we expect in terms of performance. Benchmark scores peg the Redmi Y3 closer to the Samsung Galaxy M20 more than the Redmi Note 7 Pro. We’re yet to benchmark the Redmi Note 7, but that phone we expect to perform better than this courtesy the Snapdragon 660. The Redmi Y3 as a result also sits below the Redmi Note 7. However, not everything is as it seems., CPU, , , On CPU Benchmarks, the Redmi Y3 scores 102267 on AnTuTu while on Geekbench Single Core and Multi Core tests, the Redmi Y3 scores 1237 and 4219, both of which are slightly higher than what the Samsung Galaxy M20 achieves but much, much lower than the score of the Redmi Note 7 Pro. The CPU scores indicate the Redmi Y3 has a big improvement as compared to the Redmi Y2 which ran on the Snapdragon 625. And for good reason. The Snapdragon 632 uses custom-made Kryo 250 Gold performance cores, even though the clock speed is lower at 1.8GHz., The CPU comprehensively indicates the Redmi Y3 is faster than the Galaxy M20., GPU, , The GPU benchmarks also follow the same narrative. The Redmi Y3 scored 951 on 3DMark SlingShot which is again higher than the Galaxy M20’s 746 but much lower than what the Redmi Note 7 Pro and the Realme 3 Pro achieves. This is again corroborated by GFXBench’s render tests where the Redmi Y3 rendered more frames than the Galaxy M20 but much lesser than the Note 7 Pro and the Realme 3 Pro., Gaming, Surprisingly, despite scoring lower on benchmark scores as compared to the Note 7 Pro, the Redmi Y3 is surprisingly good at gaming. We clocked steady 30FPS in Asphalt 9 with 88 percent stability as compared to the paltry 22 FPS with 52 percent stability by the Redmi Note 7 Pro., , , Even on PUBG Mobile, the Redmi Y3 came dangerously close to beating the Note 7 Pro with 26FPS with 98 percent stability, as compared to 30FPS by the Note 7 Pro and the Realme 3 Pro with around 96 percent stability. We used Gamebench for recording in-game statistics., While it’s seemingly more fun to game on the Redmi Y3 based on the frame rate data, it’s worth noting that the Redmi Y3 has a 720p screen while the Note 7 Pro has a FullHD+ display. As a result, the textures of in-game objects look much better on the Note 7 Pro. The Redmi Y3 also runs PUBG Mobile in low graphics and on Asphalt 9, the poor graphics are visibly apparent., Daily Usage, The Redmi Y3 feels quite breezy to use at first go. But after installing a few apps and stressing the phone a bit with tasks like social media browsing, watching videos and using the camera, it does slow down a bit. You won’t be able to tell it’s slow by looking at the UI though. The transitions will work just fine. However, you will notice a slight delay in bringing up the keyboard, or placing a call, or going to the Settings app and even launching apps. If you can get past it, the Redmi Y3 is a decent performer., Software, , The Redmi Y3 runs on MIUI 10 based on Android 9 Pie. You get more or less all the features that are there on the Note 7 Pro like a minus-1 screen housing all the important information, but there’s still no app drawer. The transition animations are swifter and there are deep-seated optimisations that Xiaomi claims make the phone run faster. It certainly does, but then again the processor and RAM constraints make the apps launch a little slower after prolonged use., , , 
The Redmi Y3 is a selfie-centric smartphone with a 32MP front camera. On the back is a 12+2MP setup that’s akin to the Redmi 7 with f/2.2 primarily lens and 1.25um pixel pitch. What sets this apart is obviously the high-res selfie camera that’s embedded in the water-drop notch. The working of the camera is similar to the 48MP rear camera of the Redmi Note 7 Pro. The selfie camera bins four pixels into one to create one super pixel that allows for higher light sensitivity. As a result, by default your selfies will be dished out in 8MP. You can manually turn on the high-res 32MP mode as well, but we’d recommend you to stick to the default 8MP mode. Here’s why., 32MP selfies, , , , The 32MP selfie mode is decent, to say the least. It does produce the extra facial details and lets you crop the photo to a greater extent, but it also lacks the dynamic range that’s offered by the binned mode. The samples above were taken under the bright afternoon sun have the highlights clipped to an extent that the background is all washed out. The facial details are still there and if you zoom in (sample below), almost every strand of my beard could be made out. The last sample in the series above was taken with a mix of shadows and highlights and this is where the lack of dynamic range is more apparent., 8MP selfies, On the other hand, the 8MP selfies are not only rich in details, but they also handle the dynamic range quite well. Take a look at the samples below —, , , , In all three samples above, there’s a lot more contrast and details in the selfies. The camera was able to capture all the shades of my puppy’s fur with near perfection. Agreed the background still looks washed out, but the nearer objects in the background still retain most of the details. Another thing that made me stick to the 8MP mode more was the speed at which the front camera shoots selfies in the default mode. Even with HDR turned on, the camera takes less than a second to shoot. The same is not the case in the 32MP mode. There’s a one-second delay after you press the shutter which might make you miss the moment you’re trying to capture., Low Light selfies, , Shot in 32MP mode, , Shot in 8MP mode,  , The primary reason for outfitting a 32MP camera on the front was to improve low-light selfies, and while that has improved to a certain extent, it’s still not quite usable. The 32MP mode in fact generates a lot of noise which is expected considering the pixel pitch is much smaller. The binned mode is expected to perform better here too we noticed soft details and the watercolour effect most sensors try to avoid in low-light. Perhaps this can be improved further via software updates., Portrait Selfies, , , As the samples above suggest, portrait mode, when it works, works quite well. But when it doesn’t, you get results like this. Essentially, the portrait selfie mode is tuned particularly to the human face. Dogs and other animals tend to confuse the algorithm. When the portrait mode is engaged, the subject separation is pretty accurate even though the highlights are clipped to ensure more focus on the subject., Rear camera, , , , The dual rear cameras are highly dependent on the AI algorithms to bring out good colours and contrasts. The AI takes a little time to recognise the subject you’re shooting, but the results are eye-pleasing. The quality is nowhere close to what the Redmi Note 7 Pro can produce, but it’s quite capable of producing good details as the first sample suggests. The dynamic range is a lot better in photos taken from the rear camera as seen in the second sample but low-light photos come out soft with heavy noise reduction., , , The Redmi Y3 features the same 4,000mAh battery as the Redmi Note 7 Pro and the Redmi 7. It seems like a high-capacity battery is becoming a standard in all Redmi phones this year. As a matter of fact, the same battery on the Redmi Y3 lasts a little longer than the Note 7 Pro., In our Geekbench battery test, the Redmi Y3 managed to last 693 minutes which should ensure the phone lasts well over a day of usage. PUBG Mobile itself drained the battery by around 5 percent after 15 minutes of play, while 30 minutes of streaming Mirzapur on Amazon Prime Video took up around 10 percent of charge., Charging the battery, however, took up a lot of time despite Xiaomi offering a 10W fast charger. It takes around two hours to fully top up the battery which might be a problem if you have to charge in the middle of the day, but given the day-long battery life, a top-up at night should be enough to push through the entire day., Bottomline, The Redmi Y3 has a clear-cut mission — Make selfies great again. It’s weapon of choice is a 32MP camera on the front which while preserving facial details has the tendency to blow up the highlights. The advantages of a high-res camera, however, isn’t as apparent as in the case of the Redmi Note 7 Pro’s 48MP rear camera, especially in low-light. Switch to the binned mode and you’re finally seeing why the Redmi Y3 is a solid selfie shooter.  Surprisingly, the Redmi Y3 seems fairly adept at handling popular mobile games as the gaming performance revealed. Frankly, the Redmi Y3 is a mixed-bag with a few trade-offs here and there. But if you’re not a nitpicker when it comes to choosing your smartphone, this is an easy smartphone to recommend if good selfies are particularly what you’re after.,  "

But if you’re not a nitpicker when it comes to choosing your smartphone, this is an easy smartphone to recommend if good selfies are particularly what you’re after., , If the Redmi Note 7 Pro is focused around the rear camera, the Redmi Y3 is its polar opposite with a strong focus on the selfie camera. The two smartphones are even priced similarly making it clear that if you want a selfie phone, the Redmi Y3 is the one to go for while the Note 7 Pro is for everything else. But selfies aren’t the only thing one can do with a phone. The Redmi Y2 last year addressed this quite well with decent performance mixed with a decent cameras on both sides. Can the Redmi Y3 repeat the feat? Let’s find out., Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro Review, Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review, Samsung Galaxy A70 128GB Review, Nokia 4.2 Review, Samsung Galaxy S10e Review, , The Redmi Y3, at first glance looks a lot like the Redmi Note 7 Pro. It has a similar gradient colour design with a dual tone finish in both blue and red as well as a standard black finish. However, there are subtle differences in the design between the two. The Redmi Y3’s gradient dual tone has vertical stripes running down the rear panel with the shade of colour changing after each line. It’s also more curved around the edges and rounded in the corners. Furthermore, unlike the Note 7 Pro, the Redmi Y3 is made of polycarbonate which handles fingerprints quite fine, but retains smudges and sweat marks easily. The frame also seems to be made of plastic but with a smooth polish which lends a feeling of sturdiness. The buttons however feel wobbly and could be the first thing that stops functioning after prolonged use., , The front fascia is layered with Gorilla Glass 5 protecting the LCD display. The display itself takes up most of the real estate but leaves enough space around the edges, so it’s not particularly a bezel-less display even though the screen-to-body ratio is impressive at 86.7 percent. This is possible because of the smaller U-shaped notch that houses the front camera and other sensors leaving more space for status bar icons on top of the display., Overall, the Redmi Y3’s design looks good but I’m afraid the gradient colour design has been done to death over the past year and soon enough, the Y3’s unique look might become mainstream., , 
The Redmi Y3 sports a 6.26-inch IPS LCD display with only HD+ resolution. That’s a marked departure from the superior display you get with the Redmi Note 7 Pro by spending just Rs 1000 more. Phones priced above Rs 10,000 are expected to come with a fullHD display and in this regard, the Y3 disappoints. It gets more problematic when you realise the Y3 also doesn’t have the required DRM certification to stream content in HD. Instead, premium content from Netflix, Amazon Prime and Hotstar will run at 540p, marring the viewing experience even more., While gaming, the lower resolution becomes more apparent. The texture quality of objects in PUBG Mobile come across as jagged and grainy. However, reading text and watching short videos on Facebook are a good enough experience., , The sunlight legibility is also questionable. Out in the strong sun, the Redmi Y3’s display was barely visible even at full brightness. We clocked peak brightness of 373 lux and a minimum brightness of 5 lux which is lower than what most phones in that price range scored in our tests., , , The phone does give you the option to tweak the colour temperature as well as play around with display contrast. The night mode in the phone is called Reading mode and does exactly the same as other blue-light filters. You can also increase the size of the text and turn on ‘double tap to wake’ to reduce dependence on the wobbly power button., , The Redmi Y3 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 632. It’s Qualcomm’s most basic mid-range chipset available right now, so naturally there’s not a lot that we expect in terms of performance. Benchmark scores peg the Redmi Y3 closer to the Samsung Galaxy M20 more than the Redmi Note 7 Pro. We’re yet to benchmark the Redmi Note 7, but that phone we expect to perform better than this courtesy the Snapdragon 660. The Redmi Y3 as a result also sits below the Redmi Note 7. However, not everything is as it seems., CPU, , , On CPU Benchmarks, the Redmi Y3 scores 102267 on AnTuTu while on Geekbench Single Core and Multi Core tests, the Redmi Y3 scores 1237 and 4219, both of which are slightly higher than what the Samsung Galaxy M20 achieves but much, much lower than the score of the Redmi Note 7 Pro. The CPU scores indicate the Redmi Y3 has a big improvement as compared to the Redmi Y2 which ran on the Snapdragon 625. And for good reason. The Snapdragon 632 uses custom-made Kryo 250 Gold performance cores, even though the clock speed is lower at 1.8GHz., The CPU comprehensively indicates the Redmi Y3 is faster than the Galaxy M20., GPU, , The GPU benchmarks also follow the same narrative. The Redmi Y3 scored 951 on 3DMark SlingShot which is again higher than the Galaxy M20’s 746 but much lower than what the Redmi Note 7 Pro and the Realme 3 Pro achieves. This is again corroborated by GFXBench’s render tests where the Redmi Y3 rendered more frames than the Galaxy M20 but much lesser than the Note 7 Pro and the Realme 3 Pro., Gaming, Surprisingly, despite scoring lower on benchmark scores as compared to the Note 7 Pro, the Redmi Y3 is surprisingly good at gaming. We clocked steady 30FPS in Asphalt 9 with 88 percent stability as compared to the paltry 22 FPS with 52 percent stability by the Redmi Note 7 Pro., , , Even on PUBG Mobile, the Redmi Y3 came dangerously close to beating the Note 7 Pro with 26FPS with 98 percent stability, as compared to 30FPS by the Note 7 Pro and the Realme 3 Pro with around 96 percent stability. We used Gamebench for recording in-game statistics., While it’s seemingly more fun to game on the Redmi Y3 based on the frame rate data, it’s worth noting that the Redmi Y3 has a 720p screen while the Note 7 Pro has a FullHD+ display. As a result, the textures of in-game objects look much better on the Note 7 Pro. The Redmi Y3 also runs PUBG Mobile in low graphics and on Asphalt 9, the poor graphics are visibly apparent., Daily Usage, The Redmi Y3 feels quite breezy to use at first go. But after installing a few apps and stressing the phone a bit with tasks like social media browsing, watching videos and using the camera, it does slow down a bit. You won’t be able to tell it’s slow by looking at the UI though. The transitions will work just fine. However, you will notice a slight delay in bringing up the keyboard, or placing a call, or going to the Settings app and even launching apps. If you can get past it, the Redmi Y3 is a decent performer., Software, , The Redmi Y3 runs on MIUI 10 based on Android 9 Pie. You get more or less all the features that are there on the Note 7 Pro like a minus-1 screen housing all the important information, but there’s still no app drawer. The transition animations are swifter and there are deep-seated optimisations that Xiaomi claims make the phone run faster. It certainly does, but then again the processor and RAM constraints make the apps launch a little slower after prolonged use., , ,
