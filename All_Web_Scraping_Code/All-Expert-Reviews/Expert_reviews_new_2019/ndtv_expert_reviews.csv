2244,21,asus-zenfone-max-pro-m1-review-1841211,9,10,2018-04-24,1841211,Jamshed Avari,Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/asus-zenfone-max-pro-m1-review-1841211," Asus has often experimented with emerging product markets such as netbooks, wearables, tablets, and of course smartphones. The company's biggest success in the Indian smartphone market was back in 2014, when it was one of the first to kick off the low-cost smartphone war. The original ZenFone 4 (Review), ZenFone 5 (Review), and ZenFone 6 (Review) were all quite popular, and plenty of people gave the then relatively unfamiliar brand a chance. Since then, Asus has tried a number of strategies: going exclusively high-end with the ZenFone 3 series, then focusing on selfies with the ZenFone 4 series, and targeting tiny niches now and then with products such as the ZenFone AR (Review), ZenFone Zoom S (Review), and ZenFone Live (Review). However, new Chinese brands had moved in on the value market during that time, and none of Asus' recent efforts achieved the same level of success. Now, Asus trying to going back to its strategy of delighting buyers with devices that have premium features at almost impossibly affordable prices. More specifically, it's looking to reclaim the sub-Rs. 15,000 segment where Xiaomi and Lenovo effectively have a stranglehold. It will be tougher than before, but the more options, the better for buyers. The new ZenFone Max Pro M1 was developed specifically for India, according to Asus, and it could be the first of many such devices. Its chief purpose is to knock the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 (Review) and Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review) off their perches, and with a starting price of Rs. 10,999, we're paying attention. We were able to spend some time with a pre-sale version of this phone prior to its official launch, and while there were a few elements that weren't quite ready for release, we can tell you quite a lot about the ZenFone Max Pro M1 - including whether or not it's the Xiaomi killer that Asus hopes it will be.    First of all, this is quite a good-looking phone. It will be available in Grey and Midnight Black, and our review unit is the latter. It's more of a really dark navy blue than black, and you'll see that more under strong light. It feels pretty good, with a non-slippery back and rounded-edge glass on the front. Asus says that it has used ""high-quality durable glass"", but it isn't branded and isn't specifically described as reinforced. The frame is made of aluminium and there's a metal backplate. There are no sharp edges and even the camera module barely protrudes at all. One problem is how badly the rear gets smudged with fingerprints. The Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 is also a bit thick at 8.61mm and somewhat heavy at 180g. Because of its size, you won't be able to reach all parts of the screen with one thumb, and it can be a little top-heavy when typing with both thumbs at keyboard level. However, the fingerprint scanner is within easy reach, and was quick most of the time. We had to deal with a few failed recognition attempts early in our review process, but an OTA update fixed most of these issues mid-way. There's the mandatory 18:9 screen in the front, with rounded corners and narrow borders on either side. The power and volume buttons on the right are within easy reach, as is the fingerprint sensor on the back. We're slightly disappointed to see a Micro-USB port on the bottom rather than Type-C, but we can live with this. There's also a 3.5mm audio socket and a single speaker. The tray on the left has cutouts for two Nano-SIMs as well as a microSD card. In the box, you get a 10W charger, a USB cable, some warranty and other leaflets, and a little cardboard accessory called the Max Box. This is essentially a foldable stand for the phone with a cutout in its base that helps direct and amplify sound. There's no headset, screen protector, or case of any kind bundled with the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1.  The big news here is the use of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 636 processor, designed for premium mid-range smartphones, in a device at this price level. It's no surprise that this is the same processor that Xiaomi chose for its Redmi Note 5 Pro. It is also interesting to note that Asus is using the same processor in its ""lite"" flagship ZenFone 5 (2018). We were expecting this phone to launch in India around now but it's positioned in a much higher product segment so we'll have to see how that plays out now. As a sidenote, we can now also see why Qualcomm decided to introduce a Snapdragon 700 series to fill the gap between this segment and the flagship Snapdragon 845. The other big highlight on the ZenFone Max Pro M1 spec sheet is a 5000mAh battery. Asus has used the Max name for phones with big batteries before, so this is a fitting continuation. This explains the phone's relative bulk and weight, and considering how impressed we were with the Redmi Note 5 Pro's battery life, we hope this phone blows us away. We're glad to see that there's no notch on the 5.99-inch screen. It has an 18:9 aspect ratio and resolution of 1080x2160. The corners are rounded, and Asus claims a 450nit maximum brightness with a contrast ratio of 1500:1 and 85 percent reproduction of the NTSC colour gamut. In terms of design, this phone isn't exactly borderless but it does look slick and modern. The screen is bright enough for outdoor use, and colours are quite vibrant. We had no complaints about viewing angles either. There's a night mode as well as manual colour temperature adjustment in the Settings app. You can choose between two variants of the ZenFone Max Pro M1: one has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage priced at Rs. 10,999, while the other - priced at Rs. 12,999 - has 4GB and 64GB respectively. In terms of pricing, we’d say that this is pretty unbelievable value, beating the benchmark set by Xiaomi in this price segment.    In addition to two Nano-SIM slots, this phone has a dedicated microSD card slot, and capacity support goes up to 2TB. You can use two 4G SIMs at a time, but only one will run at 4G speed while the other is limited to 3G. VoLTE is supported too. There's single-band Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n which is a surprise, considering that the Snapdragon 636 supports faster Wi-Fi 802.11ac. However you do get Bluetooth 5 with aptX audio. Asus has ditched its custom ZenUI and apps in favour of stock Android 8.1 with this model, which is quite a big surprise considering how much the company usually trumpets all the little things it pays attention to in terms of shortcuts and customisations. The company tells us that this was in response to market research, and it decided that this was the better approach for the intended market segment. Of course, it also presents a huge contrast to Xiaomi's MIUI. Asus also told Gadgets 360 that it intends to deliver updates all the way till Android Q, which would be a pretty big bonus. You get all the Android Oreo features such as notification dots, action shortcuts on app icons, and split-screen multitasking. We found ourselves missing simple things like an auto brightness toggle in the quick shortcuts panel, and the ability to double-tap the screen to wake the phone from sleep. We do know that there are some customisations though. For example, Asus is advertising facial recognition as a feature of this phone, but it hadn't been implemented yet on the pre-release software running on our unit, so we weren't able to test it for ourselves. There's still a little bloatware, but it's manageable. You get Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and Go2Pay preinstalled, and none of them can be removed. There are also a few useful ZenUI apps - Voice Recorder, Calculator, and FM Radio.  Our review unit was the variant with 3GB of RAM and we didn't feel at any point that this was too little. The ZenFone Max Pro M1 ran all our apps smoothly, and every part of the Android UI was snappy at all times. We enjoyed watching videos and playing games. This is a pretty good phone for entertainment, although the rear did get slightly warm after some time. Benchmark scores were very high, thanks to the Snapdragon 636 processor. Other than Xiaomi's Redmi Note 5 Pro, the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 doesn't have much competition in its price band. AnTuTu gave us 114,096 points, and Geekbench's single- and multi-core results were 1,330 and 4,755 respectively. GFXBench's T-rex test ran at 34fps, and 3DMark Slingshot gave us a score of 1,440. The battery was able to get us through a full working day with a fair bit of videos streaming and some time spent playing 3D games, but that isn't especially impressive considering its 5000mAh capacity. Our video loop battery test ran for 13 hours, 29 minutes which is less than what the Redmi Note 5 Pro managed with a smaller battery, and also well short of Asus's claim of 25 hours of continuous video playback. This is an odd result, and we should note that power management could improve once Asus releases the final shipping firmware. There's a 10 Watt charger charger in the box, and while Qualcomm Quick Charge isn't explicitly publicised as a feature, our review unit did display the ""charging rapidly"" message. We were able to go from zero to 15 percent in 10 minutes but it took just under three hours to get to 100 percent. The single speaker on the bottom can get very loud, but music distorts badly at full volume. The cardboard Max Box is being touted as an amplifier but it's more of a gimmick. It unfolds very cleverly into a stand with a base that channels sound towards you. There is a slight amplifying effect, but while it might be useful for music or calls, you can't use it when watching videos in landscape mode.  Camera quality is ususally where low-cost phones compromise the most so we were curious to see what the ZenFone Max Pro M1 has in store for us. Asus has outfitted the smartphone  with a 13-megapixel camera and 5-megapixel depth sensor on the rear, which meets the requirement for dual cameras. On the front, there's an 8-megapixel camera with its own flash. We found the camera app to be a little confusing, with controls that weren't well laid out at all. For example, the flash settings are in a menu and it takes three taps to turn it on or off. There's also no way to know what state it's in unless you open the menu to check. There's a ""depth mode"" toggle rather than a separate portrait mode, so you might also not always realise when it's enabled. It also takes three taps to get into video mode and begin recording. There are some scene modes and beautification, but no manual mode. The rear camera can record 4K video but for some reason there are two resolution options, 4K DCI and 4K UHD, but there's nothing telling users what the difference is (the former is 4096x2160 while the latter is 3840x2160). On the other extreme, there are options to record at QVGA (320x240) and CIF (352x240) resolutions which have no use case at all these days. We saw some minor UI changes in OTA updates during the course of our review, but we think a complete overhaul is necessary. In the daytime, the shots we took with the ZenFone Max Pro M1 were quite vibrant, with colours that popped nicely. Some details and textures at a distance weren't all that sharp, but close-ups fared relatively well in this regard. The depth mode produced visible results with smooth gradients between the foreground and background. At night, details get a little fuzzy and it takes much longer to lock focus, but things are largely under control. Tap to see full-sized Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 photo samples   Video taken during the day and at night was usable, but there was a lot of focus shifting. The front camera is pretty good as well, and people will be happy with the quality of selfies. The only trouble we had was that the front flash doesn't provide soft illumination, but is in actual flash that fires harshly in your face. Asus has promised some camera quality improvements with software updates that should be ready by the time anyone buys this phone, but even as it stands at the time of our review, the ZenFone Max Pro M1 is pretty decent. Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 in pictures VerdictAsus is going to get a lot of attention because of the pricing of the ZenFone Max Pro M1, and it's positioning itself squarely as a Xiaomi killer. The specifications match those of the Redmi Note 5 Pro, but there are a few extra perks such as the bigger battery, dedicated microSD slot, and front flash. However, the prices are more in line with those of the Redmi Note 5, which is one rung lower in Xiaomi's lineup. We also now know what the Moto G6 lineup will be like, and it seems that there won't be any challenge from that corner in terms of specifications, at least. Aside from the question marks hanging over the ZenFone Max Pro M1's camera quality and slightly underwhelming battery life, Asus has managed to pull off a massive achievement. With Flipkart on board as an exclusive partner, we're hoping that the logistics of availability and distribution will not be bottlenecked. Asus is promising that it has every intention of ensuring that there's adequate supply to meet demand, and that it isn't interested in flash sales or running out of stock quickly to create buzz. That's excellent news for buyers. We can't wait to see how Xiaomi responds. When we look back at the time that has passed since the Asus ZenFone 4, 5 and 6 were launched in India, it's incredible to consider just how much better budget smartphones have become. We would never have believed that great phones could be this affordable, but here we are with the ZenFone Max Pro M1. Asus is sending a clear message that it intends to do whatever it takes to be successful in India, and once again, buyers win. We discussed whether Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 is a Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro killer on Orbital, our weekly technology podcast, which you can subscribe to via Apple Podcasts or RSS, download the episode, or just hit the play button below."

In the box, you get a 10W charger, a USB cable, some warranty and other leaflets, and a little cardboard accessory called the Max Box. This is essentially a foldable stand for the phone with a cutout in its base that helps direct and amplify sound. There's no headset, screen protector, or case of any kind bundled with the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1.  The big news here is the use of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 636 processor, designed for premium mid-range smartphones, in a device at this price level. It's no surprise that this is the same processor that Xiaomi chose for its Redmi Note 5 Pro. It is also interesting to note that Asus is using the same processor in its ""lite"" flagship ZenFone 5 (2018). We were expecting this phone to launch in India around now but it's positioned in a much higher product segment so we'll have to see how that plays out now. As a sidenote, we can now also see why Qualcomm decided to introduce a Snapdragon 700 series to fill the gap between this segment and the flagship Snapdragon 845. The other big highlight on the ZenFone Max Pro M1 spec sheet is a 5000mAh battery. Asus has used the Max name for phones with big batteries before, so this is a fitting continuation. This explains the phone's relative bulk and weight, and considering how impressed we were with the Redmi Note 5 Pro's battery life, we hope this phone blows us away. We're glad to see that there's no notch on the 5.99-inch screen. It has an 18:9 aspect ratio and resolution of 1080x2160. The corners are rounded, and Asus claims a 450nit maximum brightness with a contrast ratio of 1500:1 and 85 percent reproduction of the NTSC colour gamut. In terms of design, this phone isn't exactly borderless but it does look slick and modern. The screen is bright enough for outdoor use, and colours are quite vibrant. We had no complaints about viewing angles either. There's a night mode as well as manual colour temperature adjustment in the Settings app. You can choose between two variants of the ZenFone Max Pro M1: one has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage priced at Rs. 10,999, while the other - priced at Rs. 12,999 - has 4GB and 64GB respectively. In terms of pricing, we’d say that this is pretty unbelievable value, beating the benchmark set by Xiaomi in this price segment.    In addition to two Nano-SIM slots, this phone has a dedicated microSD card slot, and capacity support goes up to 2TB. You can use two 4G SIMs at a time, but only one will run at 4G speed while the other is limited to 3G. VoLTE is supported too. There's single-band Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n which is a surprise, considering that the Snapdragon 636 supports faster Wi-Fi 802.11ac. However you do get Bluetooth 5 with aptX audio. Asus has ditched its custom ZenUI and apps in favour of stock Android 8.1 with this model, which is quite a big surprise considering how much the company usually trumpets all the little things it pays attention to in terms of shortcuts and customisations. The company tells us that this was in response to market research, and it decided that this was the better approach for the intended market segment. Of course, it also presents a huge contrast to Xiaomi's MIUI. Asus also told Gadgets 360 that it intends to deliver updates all the way till Android Q, which would be a pretty big bonus. You get all the Android Oreo features such as notification dots, action shortcuts on app icons, and split-screen multitasking. We found ourselves missing simple things like an auto brightness toggle in the quick shortcuts panel, and the ability to double-tap the screen to wake the phone from sleep. We do know that there are some customisations though. For example, Asus is advertising facial recognition as a feature of this phone, but it hadn't been implemented yet on the pre-release software running on our unit, so we weren't able to test it for ourselves. There's still a little bloatware, but it's manageable. You get Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and Go2Pay preinstalled, and none of them can be removed. There are also a few useful ZenUI apps - Voice Recorder, Calculator, and FM Radio.  Our review unit was the variant with 3GB of RAM and we didn't feel at any point that this was too little. The ZenFone Max Pro M1 ran all our apps smoothly, and every part of the Android UI was snappy at all times. We enjoyed watching videos and playing games. This is a pretty good phone for entertainment, although the rear did get slightly warm after some time. Benchmark scores were very high, thanks to the Snapdragon 636 processor. Other than Xiaomi's Redmi Note 5 Pro, the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 doesn't have much competition in its price band. AnTuTu gave us 114,096 points, and Geekbench's single- and multi-core results were 1,330 and 4,755 respectively. GFXBench's T-rex test ran at 34fps, and 3DMark Slingshot gave us a score of 1,440. The battery was able to get us through a full working day with a fair bit of videos streaming and some time spent playing 3D games, but that isn't especially impressive considering its 5000mAh capacity. Our video loop battery test ran for 13 hours, 29 minutes which is less than what the Redmi Note 5 Pro managed with a smaller battery, and also well short of Asus's claim of 25 hours of continuous video playback. This is an odd result, and we should note that power management could improve once Asus releases the final shipping firmware. There's a 10 Watt charger charger in the box, and while Qualcomm Quick Charge isn't explicitly publicised as a feature, our review unit did display the ""charging rapidly"" message. We were able to go from zero to 15 percent in 10 minutes but it took just under three hours to get to 100 percent. The single speaker on the bottom can get very loud, but music distorts badly at full volume. The cardboard Max Box is being touted as an amplifier but it's more of a gimmick. It unfolds very cleverly into a stand with a base that channels sound towards you. There is a slight amplifying effect, but while it might be useful for music or calls, you can't use it when watching videos in landscape mode.  Camera quality is ususally where low-cost phones compromise the most so we were curious to see what the ZenFone Max Pro M1 has in store for us. Asus has outfitted the smartphone  with a 13-megapixel camera and 5-megapixel depth sensor on the rear, which meets the requirement for dual cameras. On the front, there's an 8-megapixel camera with its own flash. We found the camera app to be a little confusing, with controls that weren't well laid out at all. For example, the flash settings are in a menu and it takes three taps to turn it on or off. There's also no way to know what state it's in unless you open the menu to check. There's a ""depth mode"" toggle rather than a separate portrait mode, so you might also not always realise when it's enabled. It also takes three taps to get into video mode and begin recording. There are some scene modes and beautification, but no manual mode. The rear camera can record 4K video but for some reason there are two resolution options, 4K DCI and 4K UHD, but there's nothing telling users what the difference is (the former is 4096x2160 while the latter is 3840x2160). On the other extreme, there are options to record at QVGA (320x240) and CIF (352x240) resolutions which have no use case at all these days. We saw some minor UI changes in OTA updates during the course of our review, but we think a complete overhaul is necessary. In the daytime, the shots we took with the ZenFone Max Pro M1 were quite vibrant, with colours that popped nicely. Some details and textures at a distance weren't all that sharp, but close-ups fared relatively well in this regard. The depth mode produced visible results with smooth gradients between the foreground and background. At night, details get a little fuzzy and it takes much longer to lock focus, but things are largely under control. Tap to see full-sized Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 photo samples   Video taken during the day and at night was usable, but there was a lot of focus shifting. The front camera is pretty good as well, and people will be happy with the quality of selfies. The only trouble we had was that the front flash doesn't provide soft illumination, but is in actual flash that fires harshly in your face. Asus has promised some camera quality improvements with software updates that should be ready by the time anyone buys this phone, but even as it stands at the time of our review, the ZenFone Max Pro M1 is pretty decent. Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 in pictures VerdictAsus is going to get a lot of attention because of the pricing of the ZenFone Max Pro M1, and it's positioning itself squarely as a Xiaomi killer. The specifications match those of the Redmi Note 5 Pro, but there are a few extra perks such as the bigger battery, dedicated microSD slot, and front flash. However, the prices are more in line with those of the Redmi Note 5, which is one rung lower in Xiaomi's lineup. We also now know what the Moto G6 lineup will be like, and it seems that there won't be any challenge from that corner in terms of specifications, at least. Aside from the question marks hanging over the ZenFone Max Pro M1's camera quality and slightly underwhelming battery life, Asus has managed to pull off a massive achievement. With Flipkart on board as an exclusive partner, we're hoping that the logistics of availability and distribution will not be bottlenecked. Asus is promising that it has every intention of ensuring that there's adequate supply to meet demand, and that it isn't interested in flash sales or running out of stock quickly to create buzz. That's excellent news for buyers. We can't wait to see how Xiaomi responds. When we look back at the time that has passed since the Asus ZenFone 4, 5 and 6 were launched in India, it's incredible to consider just how much better budget smartphones have become. We would never have believed that great phones could be this affordable, but here we are with the ZenFone Max Pro M1. Asus is sending a clear message that it intends to do whatever it takes to be successful in India, and once again, buyers win.

1900,21,coolpad-note-3s-review-1658418,7,10,2017-02-15,1658418,Jamshed Avari,Coolpad Note 3S Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/coolpad-note-3s-review-1658418," First, there was the Coolpad Note 3 (Review) in late 2015. Then, the Note 3 Lite (Review) and Note 3 Plus (Review) were launched. All three were fairly similar, with only a few specs changed in order to meet different price points and keep up with the competition. Now, however, Coolpad has decided to resuscitate this product line and launch the Coolpad Note 3S, which is quite significantly different, but aims to capture the same market. A lot of time has passed since the first Note 3 model, so the company needs to offer much more than the fingerprint sensor which made the original something of a trailblazer for budget smartphones. This particular phone will take on some very tough competition from Xiaomi, Lenovo, Huawei, Asus and Motorola, amongst others.    The Coolpad Note 3S is available in gold and white. We had the gold version in for review, and we must say it looks more like brown in person. That doesn’t mean it’s bad – in fact it stands out in the very crowded market. The glass panels on the front and rear both taper slightly starting about 1cm from each edge, rather than right where they meet the phone’s frame. There are reflections no matter which angle you look at this phone from, which make this phone look like it’s bulging outwards when it actually isn’t. The front face of the Coolpad Note 3S has a subtle dotted pattern that you can see only if you look at it really closely. Unfortunately, the Android navigation buttons below the screen aren’t backlit, and this makes them even harder to locate than usual. The rear is fairly plain, but is marred by a sticker with certification information that we’re sure most people will just peel off. We also wish that the camera hadn’t been protruding, because it detracts greatly from the curved glassy look. A single slit near the bottom replaces the usual speaker grille.  The power button is on the right, but the volume buttons are on the left, which is somewhat unusual for Android phones. There’s a Micro-USB port on the bottom, which is now starting to feel a bit old-school. There’s a 3.5mm audio socket on top, and a hybrid SIM tray which will take either two Nano-SIMs or one Nano-SIM and one microSD card. Coolpad says that the sides of the phone are made of an aluminium alloy, and we’ve seen this kind of curvy shape plenty of times before. The phone fits nicely in a palm, but one-handed use is a bit tricky and unsure because the glass rear makes it a bit difficult to maintain a solid grip. Coolpad does include a simple translucent plastic shell in the box to solve this problem, but it covers up the glass and makes using the recessed fingerprint sensor on the rear a bit awkward. Interestingly, the adhesive screen protector in the box has notches in its corners so that it can stick to the curved glass without getting pinched. There’s also a basic 1.5A charger, Micro-USB cable, and headset in the box. While the Coolpad Note 3S doesn’t offer the triple-SIM functionality of the Mega 3 (Review), the rest of the specifications are somewhat improved. To start with, there’s a Qualcomm Snapdragon 415 SoC which has eight cores running at 1.36GHz. This is a fairly dated processor and represents nearly the bottom of Qualcomm’s stack of offerings, but it does have the relatively powerful integrated Adreno 405 GPU for graphics. There’s 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, which can only be bumped up by a further 32GB, that too at the cost of a second SIM. The screen measures 5.5 inches and has a resolution of 720x1280, just like the Coolpad Mega 3. We’ve seen a few models with full-HD screens at this price, including Coolpad’s own Note 3 Plus which launched in the middle of last year priced at Rs. 8,999 but doesn’t appear to be available anymore. There’s a 13-megapixel camera on the back and another 5-megapixel one on the front. As with the rest of the Coolpad Note 3 line, there’s a fingerprint sensor on the rear. The battery capacity is just 2500mAh, which seems a bit low. Other than these things, you get the standard Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi b/g/n, LTE, and sensors. There are no perks like quick charging. According to all of Coolpad’s launch materials, you’re supposed to get Android 6.0 with the CoolUI 8 skin; exactly the same as what we saw on the Coolpad Mega 3 which launched at the same time. However, our review unit appeared to be running stock Android – complete with its app drawer rather than a single-layer UI, and the quick settings in the notifications shade rather than an iOS-style panel at the bottom of the screen. We couldn’t find any mention of CoolUI even in the Settings app – the only non-stock touch we could find was the homescreen customisation controls, including the ability to change the icon grid spacing and scroll effects.  While we prefer stock Android, it is true that custom skins have some features that people like having, such as shortcuts and customisation options. It remains to be seen whether Coolpad will ship units with CoolUI in the future. We’re happy that there isn’t as much preloaded bloatware as usual. There’s still the spammy Cool Store and the non-functional Cool Service as with the Mega 3, but the only others are AppLock, which lets you secure individual apps using a fingerprint, and Reos Music, a fairly interesting music and video player with YouTube, FM and online radio, and even a track ID service built in. If your needs don’t extend beyond voice calls, texting and a bit of social networking, you won’t find anything lacking about the Note 3S. However, if like us you tend to run a lot of apps and games and jump between them, you might feel that load times could be a bit snappier and transitions a bit smoother. Asphalt 8 ran fluidly enough, but there was a lot of waiting while the phone loaded individual races. Benchmark tests showed that while the Snapdragon 415 isn’t exactly a heavy lifter, this phone can do more than some others at this price level which are based on even weaker MediaTek processors. AnTuTu returned a score of 38,313 while Quadrant gave us 12,628 and Geekbench’s multi-core score was 1,547. Graphics performance was particularly strong for this price segment, with an average of 20fps in GFXBench’s T-rex test and 4,636 points in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme.  As expected, reflections were a pain throughout our test period. Viewing angles aren’t too bad, but you can’t always see the far edge of the screen because of this glass. If you’re serious about watching movies and playing games, this might be a problem. The screen itself is fairly good – colours could have been a little richer, but the sharpness and overall quality are more than enough. Sound through the speaker at the back is clear, but lacks bass. On the other hand, the bundled headset is honestly quite awful, making voices sound muffled and music unbearable. Coolpad’s camera app is a clone of the iOS app, with the same look and button layout. In our experience with it, there was a tiny bit of shutter lag, and the phone had trouble focusing when we tried to take close-up shots. There’s an obligatory Beauty mode, though it works with both the front and rear cameras. There’s also a Pro mode in the app which lets you focus manually and set the white balance, ISO, exposure time and saturation, which allowed for some interesting results. Photos were generally very crisp, with reasonably good detailing but somewhat muted colours. Nighttime shots varied a lot depending on the amount of ambient light there was available, and also tended to be noisy and soft in terms of focus. Video recording goes up to 1080p with 720p as the default, and quality was generally okay – just like stills, video taken in the daytime was far clearer and more useful. (Tap to see full-sized Coolpad Note 3S camera samples) Battery life was underwhelming, as expected, because of the low battery capacity. We struggled to make it to the end of a day with basic usage involving a bit of video streaming and browsing the Web. Even charging was frustratingly slow – we could only get up to about 40 percent after being plugged in for two hours. Our HD video loop test lasted only 7 hours and 52 minutes. VerdictIt’s interesting to note that the main differences between this model and the now-discontinued Note 3 and Note 3 Plus are all on the outside. In some ways, such as screen resolution, microSD card support and battery capacity, this phone is actually a step backwards from the Note 3 Plus – which even cost Rs. 1,000 less at launch. Either Coolpad has decided to prioritise looks over features with the Rs. 9,999 Note 3S, or inflation has taken a bite out of its spec sheets. In terms of both features and performance, the Coolpad Note 3S doesn’t match up well against today’s category leaders, particularly the Xiaomi Redmi 3S Prime (Review). The only thing that really sets this phone apart is its rounded-edge glass, which admittedly gives it a unique look. "
1684,21,gionee-s6-pro-review-1604115,6,10,2016-11-04,1604115,Roydon Cerejo,Gionee S6 Pro Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/gionee-s6-pro-review-1604115," Gionee’s portfolio continues to expand with its latest instalment called the S6 Pro. The company first debuted the S6 in India back in February, and has been iterating on it ever since. We recently reviewed the S6s, which is a version of the S6 that focused primarily on selfies. The new S6 Pro is also a ‘selfie-focused’ smartphone but with more power under the hood.Both the Gionee S6 and Gionee S6s were pretty average offerings, with the only consistent positives being their battery life and build quality. Also, considering these phones were priced little above Rs. 15,000, we weren’t expecting great results either. However, the S6 Pro is priced in the upper mid-range segment at Rs. 23,999, which puts it in direct competition with the likes of the Xiaomi Mi 5 (Review), Moto Z Play (Review), HTC One A9 (Review), and Asus Zenfone 3 (ZE520KL). Is the S6 Pro worth the premium it commands? Let’s find out. Gionee S6 Pro design and buildThe new model's design language has stayed relatively true to that of the original S6, with minor tweaks here and there. Chamfered edges along the sides add to its visual appeal. According to Gionee, the chassis of the S6 Pro is nearly all-metal, which lends it a sturdy feel and makes it looks quite premium. The phone is slim and doesn’t feel too heavy. The fit and finish of everything is mostly good, except for the home button, whose edges feel a bit rough. The earpiece is also placed a bit higher than usual, which ends up looking a bit odd.   The display offers good enough brightness for outdoor use, and the resolution is high enough for sharp images and text. It’s a 5.5-inch full HD IPS panel with Gorilla Glass 3 protection. There are two capacitive buttons below for navigation but no backlighting for these keys. You do get a notification LED beside the front camera on the top. The left side houses the hybrid Dual-SIM tray while the power and volume buttons sit on the right. The tactile feedback is good and placement is ergonomic. There’s a headphones socket at the top and a USB Type-C port at the bottom, with a single mono speaker just beside it.Around the back, we have the 13-megapixel camera and single-LED flash. The circular indent in the metal frame below is only for Gionee's logo, as the fingerprint sensor is integrated into the home button. Rather than having the IMEI number etched onto the metal, Gionee has resorted to a simple sticker, which is quite an eyesore. The S6 Pro ships with a 10W wall adapter, USB cable, headset, screen guard, and a simple silicon case. The quality of the accessories is good and they felt quite durable. Overall, ergonomics are good and single-handed use is possible to an extent thanks to the slim bezels. The phone can get a bit slippery when you hold it but it isn' too bad. Gionee S6 Pro specifications and featuresThe phone is powered by the octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 SoC, which is a bit more powerful than the usual MT6753 SoC that’s commonly used. You also get 4GB of RAM and a generous 64GB of storage. The latter can be expanded by using (up to) a 128GB microSD card instead of a second SIM.Other specifications of the Gionee S6 include Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi b/g/n, GPS, FM radio, and USB OTG. Being a ‘Pro’ version of the S6, we were expecting Wi-Fi 802.11ac and NFC too but sadly, neither is present. The phone supports 4G LTE with VoLTE on Band 3, 5, and 40.Just like the S6s, the S6 Pro runs Android Marshmallow but with Gionee’s Amigo 3.2 user interface. This isn't one of our favourite Android forks, and this version doesn’t seem to be much different from what we've seen before. It’s a single-layered UI so all your app icons are spread across multiple home screens. The notifications shade will only show you notifications since toggle switches for functions such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. are placed in another drawer, which can be accessed by swiping upwards from the bottom of the screen.In the Settings app, you’ll find Edge Bar, which is a vertical list of app shortcuts which can be summoned by swiping either left of right on the home button. You can add up to six shortcuts here. The ‘Split screen’ feature lets you reply to an incoming message when watching a video without having to leave the video player. ‘Suspend button’ is a slightly misleading name, and in fact it’s nothing more than a floating carousel of shortcuts, much like the iPhone’s Assistive Touch feature and Xiaomi’s Quick Ball. This being Amigo UI, you get a whole bunch of preinstalled apps. All third-party apps can be uninstalled but of course, those from Gionee cannot. There are trial games, popular shopping apps and social apps – all of which can be removed if not needed. Uninstalling apps is a fuss-free process, which we appreciate. The Abroad Service app is a bit like TripCase, which lets you manage your travel itinerary.The phone also ships with Gionee’s own VR launcher app which works with most Google Cardboard VR headsets. We tried it with the OnePlus Loop VR headset, and it worked pretty well. By default, there's only a video player for 360-degree videos but you can find more VR apps and games from an app called G Store. Sadly, these apps aren’t added to the VR launcher app so you can’t access them with the headset on. The quality of games and apps on G Store is average at best, as most aren’t really optimised well. You’ll need to keep taking the phone out of the headset to navigate through the menus.Gionee S6 Pro performanceEven with its heavy skin, general performance is good. We didn’t encounter any noticeable lag or stutter in the system animations or when switching between apps. The edges of phone heat up when using the camera and the entire body can get quite hot at times, but this wasn’t a consistent issue. GPU performance is lower than that of the comparably positioned Snapdragon 625 SoC. We got scores of 47,360 points in AnTuTu, 17fps in GFXbench, and 6281 in 3DMark Extreme. The fingerprint sensor works decently well for unlocking the device. The S6 Pro does well in media playback. High-bitrate videos play just fine and audio quality is pretty good with the bundled headset. However, the speaker is a bit weak and sound is quite tinny at high volumes. The stock audio and video players do a good job at sorting your media files and also provide DTS audio boost, which can be toggled on or off.The lack of PDAF or laser autofocus for the main 13-megapixel camera means that it's more difficult to get sharp, blur-free shots than with other phones. Focusing speed could have been a lot better, and it actually gets worse in low light. Landscapes shots lack details and colours, even in daylight. Photos viewed on the phone’s display don't look too bad, but problems are revealed on a larger screen. We even had trouble getting good detail with macro shots - even if subjects seem sharp and in focus while framing, the final picture is quite average. Low-light shots are below par too, with poor detail and lots of noise. Tap to see full-sized Gionee S6 Pro camera samples Gionee is touting its ‘screen flash’ feature for selfies but the truth is it's simply too weak to light up your whole face (let alone a group selfie), and the quality of the 8-megapixel front camera is nothing to shout about. The camera interface is thankfully easy to use, with tons to options to explore. There are a whole bunch of shooting modes, including Pro, slow-motion, panorama, etc. Video recording tops out at 1080p and the quality is again average at best. On the whole, we feel that the cameras could have been much better.The 3130mAh battery lasted for 10 hours and 13 minutes in our video loop test, which is good. With regular usage, we were easily able to go about a little more than an entire day on a single charge. There’s no fast charging here but the high wattage adapter manages to fill the battery completely in a couple of hours.VerdictThe upper mid-range segment of smartphones is generally where we find good all-rounders. Since these devices aren’t built to fit a tight budget, manufacturers can afford to put in some quality components to make them excel in a few departments but still keep users happy with the rest. Gionee’s previous S6 models have been good at battery life and build quality but haven't offered anything special in other areas. Sadly, nothing seems to have changed with the S6 Pro.Apart from build quality, battery life and the display, there’s nothing that would make you pick this model over similarly priced ones from Lenovo, Xiaomi, Asus or HTC. The cameras continue to be the weakest link with both front and back ones offering mediocre performance in most lighting conditions. The phone also tends to heat up when using the camera. Gionee has missed out on details like Wi-Fi 802.11ac, NFC, backlit capacitive buttons, fast charging, and perhaps a dedicated slot for the microSD card. Overall, we'd recommend giving this one a pass.  Gionee S6 Pro in pictures"
1684,21,gionee-s6s-review-1450228,7,10,2016-09-13,1450228,Ketan Pratap,Gionee S6s Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/gionee-s6s-review-1450228," Gionee has been expanding its smartphone portfolio 'wisely' in India. What it means is that unlike some Chinese handset brands, Gionee smartphones are not just limited to one price segment. The 'S' series is the company's premium handset series, and we saw the launch of the Gionee S6 at the beginning of this year. The Chinese company has now unveiled the upgraded Gionee S6s smartphone and claims the ""selfie flash"" is the biggest highlight of the handset. Gionee claims it is targeting young buyers in the age group 18 to 25, and selfie-obsessed with its new handset. But with unibody metal build and decent under the hood prowess, will the Gionee S6s perform better than other smartphones in its price segment? Let's find out in our review. Look and feelThe unibody design of the Gionee S6s feels sturdy when held in hands. The metal sides offer decent grip but at 166 grams, the Gionee S6s is slightly heavy for its size. The front is dominated by the 5.5-inch 2.5D curved display that comes with Corning Gorilla Glass coating, while the rear is all metal. A Gold lining runs throughout the corners at the back of the handset that gives it a premium feel. Gionee, as seen in its other smartphones, has used three capacitive buttons for Back, Home, and Recent. The front camera accompanied by an LED flash sits on top of the display.  The rear panel packs the primary camera with LED flash while there is the fingerprint scanner placed right below the camera. Gionee's new logo is placed underneath the fingerprint scanner and makes for perfect symmetry. A speaker grille is placed at the bottom accompanied by the company branding. The right panel houses the power and volume rocker buttons while the left packs the hybrid SIM slot. The bottom holds the regular Micro-USB charging slot and a 3.5mm audio jack. At 8.15mm thickness, the Gionee S6s is definitely not the slimmest smartphone available in the market but during usage it didn't feel uncomfortably thick. We however want to point it out that if the 'Gionee' branding was removed from the back of the handset, the S6s could easily be mistaken for a phone launched by Oppo, Huawei, or LeEco. With metal unibody design, the back panels of several handsets have started to look similar in a lot of aspects. For example, the lines at the top and bottom of the handset and the rounded fingerprint scanner as well as its placement right below the camera look all too familiar.  The company unveiled the S6s in just two colours Latte Gold and Mocha Gold in India. We got the Latte Gold unit for review. The 5.5-inch full-HD display was sharp and fairly bright. We were impressed by the sunlight legibility of the S6s smartphone. Viewing angles were not an issue during our usage. Gionee ships the S6s with an in-cell IPS display and it had decent Black levels. Watching movies and playing games on the Gionee S6s is a treat with no noticeable real world issues. Overall, the Gionee S6s scores well in terms of design and the build looks solid. However, we wish that the corners of the handset were more rounded for ease of use. Specifications and softwareThe Gionee S6s features a 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920 pixels) IPS display and comes with Corning Gorilla Glass. The company has used the 2.5D curved glass on the S6s that has lately been seen many handsets, even those launching at lower price tags. The dual-SIM Gionee S6s runs the company's Amigo 3.2 based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow.  It is powered by a 1.3GHz octa-core MediaTek MT6753 SoC, coupled with 3GB of RAM. It's worth noting that Gionee has been one of the brands that has been persistently using MediaTek chipsets. At launch, we asked Arvind Vohra, Country CEO and MD, Gionee India, why the company chose MediaTek chipsets and not Qualcomm Snapdragon SoCs. Vohra responded claiming that the MediaTek chipsets were capable of delivering what Gionee wanted its phones to do and that was enough to go with the SoCs. The S6s sports a 13-megapixel autofocus rear camera with Sony IMX258 sensor, an f/2.0 aperture, and an LED flash. There is an 8-megapixel fixed-focus front-facing camera with an LED flash. The front camera comes with an f/2.2 aperture, and a 5P lens. Additionally, the front camera also features screen flash support. The S6s comes with 32GB of on-board storage and supports hybrid dual-SIM card slot that means it can be expanded via microSD card (up to 128GB). As for connectivity options, the Gionee S6s offers 4G (with VoLTE), Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.0, 3.5mm headphone jack, and Micro-USB. It is backed by a 3150mAh non-removable battery, and features a fingerprint sensor on the rear panel. The S6s ships with regular Micro-USB slot which means no USB Type-C connectivity. The Gionee S6s comes bundled with a display protector film and a transparent case.  The Gionee S6s runs the company's proprietary Amigo 3.2 custom ROM which is based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. There are some new visual effects on the S6s that were not available in earlier models. Users can now arrange the apps on different home screens with the help of two new options - Cleanup, that clears either the top or bottom of the home screen for addition of new apps, and Arrange, which will help users arrange installed apps spread across various panes. Since the Gionee S6s smartphone runs Amigo 3.2 based on Marshmallow, we noticed several Android M features such as the Now on Tap and App permissions.  As before, there is no app drawer and all the apps are spread across multiple home-screens. Many Chinese handset manufacturers have toned down their custom Android version, which means the devices now feature less pre-loaded apps. Unfortunately, this cannot be said for Gionee as the S6s smartphone ships with several pre-loaded apps. To name a few apps included in the phone were Gionee Xender, Hotoday, Compass, Mobile anti-theft app, G Store, System Manager, and Mood Wallpaper. Gionee is shipping the S6s with its Chameleon app that can pick a colour from any object using the camera and then make a theme based on the colour. The software on the Gionee S6s comes with a lot of features such as Fake Calls, Super Screenshot tool, Theme Park, and extreme battery mode settings, and other software features previously also seen on the Gionee Marathon M5 Plus (Review). The Gionee S6s on the software front surely looks better than the Marathon M5 Plus that ran Amigo 3.1 on top of Android 5.1 Lollipop. However, the biggest disappointment in terms of software was the number of pre-loaded apps and the fact they can't be removed. PerformanceWe didn't face any lags during multi-tasking or were bugged by any serious performance related glitches in daily usage. We noticed the Gionee S6s dropped some frame when we played games like Dead Trigger 2. We also experienced slight heating issues during long gaming sessions, but nothing that would make the phone uncomfortable to hold.  Voice calls on the Gionee S6s were clear and we didn't face call drops due to handset issues. We spent considerate time on the Gionee S6s reading e-books and had no issues with the display. 4G connectivity was no problem, though we didn't get a chance to test VoLTE. Performance was decent on the Gionee S6s and it handled whatever we threw at it. The AnTuTu benchmark test gave us a score of 38,208, and we got a score of 21,585 on Quadrant, while the GFXbench returned 13fps in the T-Rex test.  We have to specially mention the Music app that offers plenty of tweaking options. The music quality from speakers was decent and it handled loud music without any problems. The speakers, however, are not very ideal for long movie-watching sessions. We preferred the bundled earphones, which delivered better audio enhancements with good bass levels.  The 13-megapixel autofocus rear camera on the Gionee S6s ships with a Sony sensor and it clicked some decent shots with good amount of detail and colour accuracy. One will however notice lack of details when cropping the photos or zooming in the images. The edges also lacked detail. We were however surprised with the quality of low-light shots taken by the S6s. The images clicked by S6s in low-light were, for example, better than the Marathon M5 Plus.  (Tap to see full-sized Gionee 6s camera samples) One of the biggest selling points of the Gionee S6s as marketed by the company is its front camera. The 8-megapixel fixed-focus front camera comes with its own flash module and packs an f/2.2 aperture with a 5P lens. Selfies are great with decent colour accuracy, if taken in well lit conditions. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for indoor settings with low lighting. Gionee has added a front flash as well as screen flash for making the selfies look great. But unfortunately, the flash is effective to only some extent. The front flash, for example, wouldn't be of much help in completely dark conditions.  We were impressed with camera app on the Gionee S6s which launched quickly and did not suffer from any lags. There are plethora of options to choose from including Panorama, Slow motion, Macro, Night, Time lapse, Text recognition, HDR, Professional, Smart scene, Ultra pixel, Mood photo, PicNote, GIF, and Smart scan. The camera app also offers additional settings such as option to choose Scene mode, Exposure, and White balance among others. The rear camera is capable of recording videos at 1080p quality. Battery LifeThe Gionee S6s smartphone packs a 3150mAh battery that is non-removable. In our video loop tests, the Gionee S6s lasted for 13 hours and 10 minutes, which is good. The S6s also managed to beat its predecessor (the S6) by over an hour. Considering that the Gionee S6 (Review) shipped with the same battery size as the S6s, we wanted to understand how the S6s was able to deliver more than its predecessor in the same tests. Gionee's product team informed Gadgets 360 that the latest version of Amigo comes with some battery specific optimisations that help in getting more battery backup.  In regular usage, the Gionee S6s easily lasted for over a day and we only charged the handset after almost 30 hours from the last charging time. We noticed the handset only took over two hours to fully charge from zero, even though it officially doesn't support fast charging. VerdictAt Rs. 17,999, the Gionee S6s makes for a decent package with all-metal design. But considering that the company is pushing the Gionee S6s as the best selfie smartphone out in the market we were not very impressed with the low light front camera performance. We were also not very happy with the overall performance as we noticed slight heating issues during our usage and frame drops while gaming. The overall experience with the Gionee S6s is however satisfactory, with no real big issues that would bother someone in daily usage. Considering that there are a lot of smartphones priced around Rs. 15,000 that come with the exact package that Gionee is offering with the S6s, we wonder how Gionee will position it in the market. A slightly lower price for the S6s would have definitely helped the company seal the deal. One of the biggest advantages for the Gionee S6s will be its availability from offline retailers as well."

The company focussed mainly on the budget segment, with good designs and efficient hardware. We also got the Honor Play, a powerful gaming-centric smartphone aimed at budget-conscious buyers. The first smartphone for 2019 from the Chinese manufacturer is the Honor 10 Lite. It is powered by the relatively new Kirin 710 SoC and has a big display with a small dewdrop notch. What is interesting is that the Honor 10 Lite price in India puts it in a hot segment, where multiple manufacturers are already exchanging blows. Can the Honor 10 Lite deliver the knockout punch? We review it to find out.    You know this is an Honor phone when you first look at its glossy back panel. Honor is known to use this kind of finish on its devices, and the Honor 10 Lite comes in three different glossy colours: Sapphire Blue, Sky Blue, and Midnight Black. We had the Sapphire Blue variant for review, and it reminded us of the Honor 8X (Review) and the Honor 9N (Review). While the back does attract a lot of attention, it also picks up smudges very easily. Honor ships a transparent case in the box which helps with this. The 10 Lite is the first smartphone from Honor with a dewdrop notch. The tiny notch sits in the centre at the top of the display and only houses the selfie camera. In order to make the notch this small, Honor has moved the earpiece towards the frame of the smartphone. The notification LED has been moved to the bottom bezel, and you'll only notice it when it lights up. The front is dominated by a 6.21-inch display surrounded by thin bezels all around it. Honor claims that the chip-on-film screen technology it has used enables it to avoid having a thick chin by curving the layer with the circuitry downwards. The frame as well as the back of the phone are made out of plastic and don't feel premium to the touch. This might be an attempt to keep the cost and the weight of the device down. The dewdrop notch on the Honor 10 Lite   Honor has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right. The power button is easy to hit but you might have to shuffle the phone in your hand to reach the volume buttons. The left side of the phone is bare, as the SIM tray now sits on the top alongside a secondary microphone. We fear that the placement of the secondary microphone might confuse people into pushing the SIM ejector tool into this hole instead of the SIM tray itself. At the bottom, the phone has a Micro-USB port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, the primary mic, and a bottom-firing loudspeaker. Honor ships a 10W charger in the box to top the phone up. The Honor 10 Lite has a dual camera setup at the back along with a single LED flash and the fingerprint scanner. Honor has curved the sides of the phone which makes it comfortable to hold. Honor claims that the 10 Lite has a 91 percent screen-to-body ratio thanks to its big display. The 6.21-inch panel has a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a full-HD+ resolution. There is no mention of any sort of protection for the display, so you may want to be careful while handling the device. Honor does pre-apply a screen protector which should keep it safe from minor scratches. Powering the Honor 10 Lite is the Huawei Kirin 710 SoC, which is also seen powering phones like the Huawei Nova 3i (Review) and the Honor 8X. It is an octa-core processor based on a 12nm process and is clocked at 2.2GHz. The Honor 10 Lite comes in 4GB RAM and 6GB RAM variants, though storage remains the same at 64GB with both. If you aren't satisfied with the storage, you can expand it by up to 512GB using the hybrid dual-SIM slot. If you aren't expanding storage, you can use two Nano-SIMs. The device has support for dual 4G VoLTE. Other connectivity options include Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, GPS, and GLONASS. The Honor 10 Lite is powered by a HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC   The 10 Lite is the first smartphone from Honor to ship with Android Pie out-of-the-box. Our review unit was running EMUI 9.0.1 on top with the November security patch. It's similar to what we have seen with previous versions of EMUI but it does have a few additions. The first is the Digital Balance app, which is similar to Digital Wellbeing on stock Android. It gives you a breakdown of how you have spent your time on this smartphone. You'll also find a screen management setting that lets you limit screen time in general or for specific apps. Finally, it has the option to switch the screen to grayscale when it's bedtime. As a parent, you can also set screen time and app restrictions here, and secure them with a passcode. Just like most other recently launched smartphones, you get the option to enable gestures-based navigation. This hides the standard Android navigation bar, and you have to swipe to navigate instead. There are other gesture controls such as flip to mute and three-finger screenshot. Honor has also baked in theme support which makes it easy for you to change how the UI looks, right from the icon pack to the lock screen style and font. The Kirin 710 is capable of running the day-to-day tasks without breaking into a sweat. Our review unit was the variant with 4GB of RAM, and we found that it was capable of delivering a smooth experience for day-to-day use. We did not find any lag or stutter, and the phone could multitask easily. During our use, we found the fingerprint scanner to be slow to unlock the smartphone. The Honor 10 Lite also has a face unlock feature which uses the selfie camera. Face recognition was faster than the fingerprint scanner and worked in most lighting scenarios. Honor 10 Lite packs dual 4G VoLTE support    We put the Honor 10 Lite through a couple of benchmarks to see how it fares. In AnTuTu, the phone scored 1,29,535, and it also managed 1539 and 5502 in Geekbench 4's single-core and multi-core tests respectively. The phone managed 36fps in GFXBench T-Rex and 13fps in Manhattan 3.1. In 3DMark Slingshot, it scored 947, and it maxed out in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme. The Kirin 710 scores higher than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 in CPU benchmarks but falls behind in GPU tests. The Honor 10 Lite ran games like PUBG Mobile at the Medium setting with the graphics at Balanced and Frame Rate set to Medium. With these settings, we did not notice lag while gaming. We observed that the battery drain was 11 percent after 36 minutes of PUBG Mobile. The 3400mAh battery in the Honor 10 Lite lasted for 11 hours and 20 minutes in our HD video loop test. Our usage consisted of an active WhatsApp account, about an hour of gaming, 50 minutes of navigation using Google Maps and a few YouTube videos, and we were still left with 46 percent at the end of 24 hours. Honor does not supply a fast charger in the box, and the standard 10W charger is slow to charge the phone. Honor has gone with a dual rear camera setup for the 10 Lite consisting of a 13-megapixel primary camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. For selfies, you get a 24-megapixel shooter that sits in the notch. The camera software is similar to what we have seen on other Honor phones, and the company boasts of AI for both the primary as well as the selfie cameras. There are Aperture, Night, Portrait, Panorama, Pro, and Time-lapse modes, apart from the usual photo and video modes. HDR is a different mode instead of a quick toggle, which would have been preferred. HiVision, the AI feature we have seen on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro (Review), is also available, but is limited to identifying objects, translating text, and scanning QR codes. The Honor 10 Lite is quick to focus and can meter scenes correctly. With the AI mode enabled, the smartphone could detect what it was pointed towards. The output in this mode, however, was too saturated. While skies looked bluer and grass looked greener on the phone's display, this made shots look more artificial overall. Tap to see full-sized Honor 10 Lite camera samples   In several instances, we noted that photos taken without AI were better than ones taking using the AI mode, with this behaviour particularly noticeable with macro shots. The Honor 10 Lite also managed decent separation between the subject and the background. Portrait mode on the Honor 10 Lite did not deliver good results. Edge detection wasn't accurate, and the phone did not blur backgrounds completely in a few instances. In landscape shots, the Honor 10 Lite failed to capture details in objects at a distance. Low-light performance too was below average. If AI is enabled, it enables night mode automatically which keeps the shutter open for longer. This resulted in blurry shots if the subjects moved at all. Photos taken at night did not have much noise, but missed out on details. The selfie camera has beautification enabled by default, which will smoothen faces. You can switch it off completely or tweak the level of beautification. There's a Bokeh mode as well, which lets you blur backgrounds. However, it does not let you tweak the level of the blur. Video recording maxes out at 1080p for both the primary as well as the selfie cameras. You also have the option to record footage at 60fps with the rear camera. However, this phone lacks image stabilisation which results in shaky output. VerdictThe lower priced variant of the Honor 10 Lite is yet another smartphone in the very competitive sub-Rs. 15,000 price segment. In order to stand out, the 10 Lite sports a glossy finish. It also is the first phone from Honor to have a dewdrop notch and to ship with Android Pie out-of-the-box. The Kirin 710 SoC is powerful and does manage to stand up against the Snapdragon 660 SoC which is quite popular in this segment. Where the Honor 10 Lite falters are its cameras. It faces stiff competition from the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 (Review), the Realme U1 (Review), and the Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review), which recently got a price cut. While the 4GB/ 64GB variant is worth considering at Rs. 13,999, we think the 6GB/ 64GB variant priced at Rs. 17,999 is much less appealing compared to other options under Rs. 20,000."

Honor claims that the 10 Lite has a 91 percent screen-to-body ratio thanks to its big display. The 6.21-inch panel has a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a full-HD+ resolution. There is no mention of any sort of protection for the display, so you may want to be careful while handling the device. Honor does pre-apply a screen protector which should keep it safe from minor scratches. Powering the Honor 10 Lite is the Huawei Kirin 710 SoC, which is also seen powering phones like the Huawei Nova 3i (Review) and the Honor 8X. It is an octa-core processor based on a 12nm process and is clocked at 2.2GHz. The Honor 10 Lite comes in 4GB RAM and 6GB RAM variants, though storage remains the same at 64GB with both. If you aren't satisfied with the storage, you can expand it by up to 512GB using the hybrid dual-SIM slot. If you aren't expanding storage, you can use two Nano-SIMs. The device has support for dual 4G VoLTE. Other connectivity options include Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, GPS, and GLONASS. The Honor 10 Lite is powered by a HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC   The 10 Lite is the first smartphone from Honor to ship with Android Pie out-of-the-box. Our review unit was running EMUI 9.0.1 on top with the November security patch. It's similar to what we have seen with previous versions of EMUI but it does have a few additions. The first is the Digital Balance app, which is similar to Digital Wellbeing on stock Android. It gives you a breakdown of how you have spent your time on this smartphone. You'll also find a screen management setting that lets you limit screen time in general or for specific apps. Finally, it has the option to switch the screen to grayscale when it's bedtime. As a parent, you can also set screen time and app restrictions here, and secure them with a passcode. Just like most other recently launched smartphones, you get the option to enable gestures-based navigation. This hides the standard Android navigation bar, and you have to swipe to navigate instead. There are other gesture controls such as flip to mute and three-finger screenshot. Honor has also baked in theme support which makes it easy for you to change how the UI looks, right from the icon pack to the lock screen style and font. The Kirin 710 is capable of running the day-to-day tasks without breaking into a sweat. Our review unit was the variant with 4GB of RAM, and we found that it was capable of delivering a smooth experience for day-to-day use. We did not find any lag or stutter, and the phone could multitask easily. During our use, we found the fingerprint scanner to be slow to unlock the smartphone. The Honor 10 Lite also has a face unlock feature which uses the selfie camera. Face recognition was faster than the fingerprint scanner and worked in most lighting scenarios. Honor 10 Lite packs dual 4G VoLTE support    We put the Honor 10 Lite through a couple of benchmarks to see how it fares. In AnTuTu, the phone scored 1,29,535, and it also managed 1539 and 5502 in Geekbench 4's single-core and multi-core tests respectively. The phone managed 36fps in GFXBench T-Rex and 13fps in Manhattan 3.1. In 3DMark Slingshot, it scored 947, and it maxed out in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme. The Kirin 710 scores higher than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 in CPU benchmarks but falls behind in GPU tests. The Honor 10 Lite ran games like PUBG Mobile at the Medium setting with the graphics at Balanced and Frame Rate set to Medium. With these settings, we did not notice lag while gaming. We observed that the battery drain was 11 percent after 36 minutes of PUBG Mobile. The 3400mAh battery in the Honor 10 Lite lasted for 11 hours and 20 minutes in our HD video loop test. Our usage consisted of an active WhatsApp account, about an hour of gaming, 50 minutes of navigation using Google Maps and a few YouTube videos, and we were still left with 46 percent at the end of 24 hours. Honor does not supply a fast charger in the box, and the standard 10W charger is slow to charge the phone. Honor has gone with a dual rear camera setup for the 10 Lite consisting of a 13-megapixel primary camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. For selfies, you get a 24-megapixel shooter that sits in the notch. The camera software is similar to what we have seen on other Honor phones, and the company boasts of AI for both the primary as well as the selfie cameras. There are Aperture, Night, Portrait, Panorama, Pro, and Time-lapse modes, apart from the usual photo and video modes. HDR is a different mode instead of a quick toggle, which would have been preferred. HiVision, the AI feature we have seen on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro (Review), is also available, but is limited to identifying objects, translating text, and scanning QR codes. The Honor 10 Lite is quick to focus and can meter scenes correctly. With the AI mode enabled, the smartphone could detect what it was pointed towards. The output in this mode, however, was too saturated. While skies looked bluer and grass looked greener on the phone's display, this made shots look more artificial overall. Tap to see full-sized Honor 10 Lite camera samples   In several instances, we noted that photos taken without AI were better than ones taking using the AI mode, with this behaviour particularly noticeable with macro shots. The Honor 10 Lite also managed decent separation between the subject and the background. Portrait mode on the Honor 10 Lite did not deliver good results. Edge detection wasn't accurate, and the phone did not blur backgrounds completely in a few instances. In landscape shots, the Honor 10 Lite failed to capture details in objects at a distance. Low-light performance too was below average. If AI is enabled, it enables night mode automatically which keeps the shutter open for longer. This resulted in blurry shots if the subjects moved at all. Photos taken at night did not have much noise, but missed out on details. The selfie camera has beautification enabled by default, which will smoothen faces. You can switch it off completely or tweak the level of beautification. There's a Bokeh mode as well, which lets you blur backgrounds. However, it does not let you tweak the level of the blur. Video recording maxes out at 1080p for both the primary as well as the selfie cameras. You also have the option to record footage at 60fps with the rear camera. However, this phone lacks image stabilisation which results in shaky output. VerdictThe lower priced variant of the Honor 10 Lite is yet another smartphone in the very competitive sub-Rs. 15,000 price segment. In order to stand out, the 10 Lite sports a glossy finish. It also is the first phone from Honor to have a dewdrop notch and to ship with Android Pie out-of-the-box. The Kirin 710 SoC is powerful and does manage to stand up against the Snapdragon 660 SoC which is quite popular in this segment. Where the Honor 10 Lite falters are its cameras. It faces stiff competition from the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 (Review), the Realme U1 (Review), and the Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review), which recently got a price cut. While the 4GB/ 64GB variant is worth considering at Rs. 13,999, we think the 6GB/ 64GB variant priced at Rs. 17,999 is much less appealing compared to other options under Rs. 20,000."

The company focussed mainly on the budget segment, with good designs and efficient hardware. We also got the Honor Play, a powerful gaming-centric smartphone aimed at budget-conscious buyers. The first smartphone for 2019 from the Chinese manufacturer is the Honor 10 Lite. It is powered by the relatively new Kirin 710 SoC and has a big display with a small dewdrop notch. What is interesting is that the Honor 10 Lite price in India puts it in a hot segment, where multiple manufacturers are already exchanging blows. Can the Honor 10 Lite deliver the knockout punch? We review it to find out.    You know this is an Honor phone when you first look at its glossy back panel. Honor is known to use this kind of finish on its devices, and the Honor 10 Lite comes in three different glossy colours: Sapphire Blue, Sky Blue, and Midnight Black. We had the Sapphire Blue variant for review, and it reminded us of the Honor 8X (Review) and the Honor 9N (Review). While the back does attract a lot of attention, it also picks up smudges very easily. Honor ships a transparent case in the box which helps with this. The 10 Lite is the first smartphone from Honor with a dewdrop notch. The tiny notch sits in the centre at the top of the display and only houses the selfie camera. In order to make the notch this small, Honor has moved the earpiece towards the frame of the smartphone. The notification LED has been moved to the bottom bezel, and you'll only notice it when it lights up. The front is dominated by a 6.21-inch display surrounded by thin bezels all around it. Honor claims that the chip-on-film screen technology it has used enables it to avoid having a thick chin by curving the layer with the circuitry downwards. The frame as well as the back of the phone are made out of plastic and don't feel premium to the touch. This might be an attempt to keep the cost and the weight of the device down. The dewdrop notch on the Honor 10 Lite   Honor has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right. The power button is easy to hit but you might have to shuffle the phone in your hand to reach the volume buttons. The left side of the phone is bare, as the SIM tray now sits on the top alongside a secondary microphone. We fear that the placement of the secondary microphone might confuse people into pushing the SIM ejector tool into this hole instead of the SIM tray itself.

It is an octa-core processor based on a 12nm process and is clocked at 2.2GHz. The Honor 10 Lite comes in 4GB RAM and 6GB RAM variants, though storage remains the same at 64GB with both. If you aren't satisfied with the storage, you can expand it by up to 512GB using the hybrid dual-SIM slot. If you aren't expanding storage, you can use two Nano-SIMs. The device has support for dual 4G VoLTE. Other connectivity options include Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, GPS, and GLONASS. The Honor 10 Lite is powered by a HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC   The 10 Lite is the first smartphone from Honor to ship with Android Pie out-of-the-box. Our review unit was running EMUI 9.0.1 on top with the November security patch. It's similar to what we have seen with previous versions of EMUI but it does have a few additions. The first is the Digital Balance app, which is similar to Digital Wellbeing on stock Android. It gives you a breakdown of how you have spent your time on this smartphone. You'll also find a screen management setting that lets you limit screen time in general or for specific apps. Finally, it has the option to switch the screen to grayscale when it's bedtime. As a parent, you can also set screen time and app restrictions here, and secure them with a passcode. Just like most other recently launched smartphones, you get the option to enable gestures-based navigation. This hides the standard Android navigation bar, and you have to swipe to navigate instead. There are other gesture controls such as flip to mute and three-finger screenshot. Honor has also baked in theme support which makes it easy for you to change how the UI looks, right from the icon pack to the lock screen style and font. The Kirin 710 is capable of running the day-to-day tasks without breaking into a sweat. Our review unit was the variant with 4GB of RAM, and we found that it was capable of delivering a smooth experience for day-to-day use. We did not find any lag or stutter, and the phone could multitask easily. During our use, we found the fingerprint scanner to be slow to unlock the smartphone. The Honor 10 Lite also has a face unlock feature which uses the selfie camera. Face recognition was faster than the fingerprint scanner and worked in most lighting scenarios. Honor 10 Lite packs dual 4G VoLTE support    We put the Honor 10 Lite through a couple of benchmarks to see how it fares. In AnTuTu, the phone scored 1,29,535, and it also managed 1539 and 5502 in Geekbench 4's single-core and multi-core tests respectively. The phone managed 36fps in GFXBench T-Rex and 13fps in Manhattan 3.1. In 3DMark Slingshot, it scored 947, and it maxed out in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme. The Kirin 710 scores higher than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 in CPU benchmarks but falls behind in GPU tests. The Honor 10 Lite ran games like PUBG Mobile at the Medium setting with the graphics at Balanced and Frame Rate set to Medium. With these settings, we did not notice lag while gaming. We observed that the battery drain was 11 percent after 36 minutes of PUBG Mobile. The 3400mAh battery in the Honor 10 Lite lasted for 11 hours and 20 minutes in our HD video loop test. Our usage consisted of an active WhatsApp account, about an hour of gaming, 50 minutes of navigation using Google Maps and a few YouTube videos, and we were still left with 46 percent at the end of 24 hours. Honor does not supply a fast charger in the box, and the standard 10W charger is slow to charge the phone. Honor has gone with a dual rear camera setup for the 10 Lite consisting of a 13-megapixel primary camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. For selfies, you get a 24-megapixel shooter that sits in the notch. The camera software is similar to what we have seen on other Honor phones, and the company boasts of AI for both the primary as well as the selfie cameras. There are Aperture, Night, Portrait, Panorama, Pro, and Time-lapse modes, apart from the usual photo and video modes. HDR is a different mode instead of a quick toggle, which would have been preferred. HiVision, the AI feature we have seen on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro (Review), is also available, but is limited to identifying objects, translating text, and scanning QR codes. The Honor 10 Lite is quick to focus and can meter scenes correctly. With the AI mode enabled, the smartphone could detect what it was pointed towards. The output in this mode, however, was too saturated. While skies looked bluer and grass looked greener on the phone's display, this made shots look more artificial overall. Tap to see full-sized Honor 10 Lite camera samples   In several instances, we noted that photos taken without AI were better than ones taking using the AI mode, with this behaviour particularly noticeable with macro shots. The Honor 10 Lite also managed decent separation between the subject and the background. Portrait mode on the Honor 10 Lite did not deliver good results. Edge detection wasn't accurate, and the phone did not blur backgrounds completely in a few instances. In landscape shots, the Honor 10 Lite failed to capture details in objects at a distance. Low-light performance too was below average. If AI is enabled, it enables night mode automatically which keeps the shutter open for longer. This resulted in blurry shots if the subjects moved at all. Photos taken at night did not have much noise, but missed out on details. The selfie camera has beautification enabled by default, which will smoothen faces. You can switch it off completely or tweak the level of beautification. There's a Bokeh mode as well, which lets you blur backgrounds. However, it does not let you tweak the level of the blur. Video recording maxes out at 1080p for both the primary as well as the selfie cameras. You also have the option to record footage at 60fps with the rear camera. However, this phone lacks image stabilisation which results in shaky output. VerdictThe lower priced variant of the Honor 10 Lite is yet another smartphone in the very competitive sub-Rs. 15,000 price segment. In order to stand out, the 10 Lite sports a glossy finish. It also is the first phone from Honor to have a dewdrop notch and to ship with Android Pie out-of-the-box. The Kirin 710 SoC is powerful and does manage to stand up against the Snapdragon 660 SoC which is quite popular in this segment. Where the Honor 10 Lite falters are its cameras. It faces stiff competition from the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 (Review), the Realme U1 (Review), and the Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review), which recently got a price cut. While the 4GB/ 64GB variant is worth considering at Rs. 13,999, we think the 6GB/ 64GB variant priced at Rs. 17,999 is much less appealing compared to other options under Rs. 20,000."

The company focussed mainly on the budget segment, with good designs and efficient hardware. We also got the Honor Play, a powerful gaming-centric smartphone aimed at budget-conscious buyers. The first smartphone for 2019 from the Chinese manufacturer is the Honor 10 Lite. It is powered by the relatively new Kirin 710 SoC and has a big display with a small dewdrop notch. What is interesting is that the Honor 10 Lite price in India puts it in a hot segment, where multiple manufacturers are already exchanging blows. Can the Honor 10 Lite deliver the knockout punch? We review it to find out.    You know this is an Honor phone when you first look at its glossy back panel. Honor is known to use this kind of finish on its devices, and the Honor 10 Lite comes in three different glossy colours: Sapphire Blue, Sky Blue, and Midnight Black. We had the Sapphire Blue variant for review, and it reminded us of the Honor 8X (Review) and the Honor 9N (Review). While the back does attract a lot of attention, it also picks up smudges very easily. Honor ships a transparent case in the box which helps with this. The 10 Lite is the first smartphone from Honor with a dewdrop notch. The tiny notch sits in the centre at the top of the display and only houses the selfie camera. In order to make the notch this small, Honor has moved the earpiece towards the frame of the smartphone. The notification LED has been moved to the bottom bezel, and you'll only notice it when it lights up. The front is dominated by a 6.21-inch display surrounded by thin bezels all around it. Honor claims that the chip-on-film screen technology it has used enables it to avoid having a thick chin by curving the layer with the circuitry downwards. The frame as well as the back of the phone are made out of plastic and don't feel premium to the touch. This might be an attempt to keep the cost and the weight of the device down. The dewdrop notch on the Honor 10 Lite   Honor has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right. The power button is easy to hit but you might have to shuffle the phone in your hand to reach the volume buttons. The left side of the phone is bare, as the SIM tray now sits on the top alongside a secondary microphone. We fear that the placement of the secondary microphone might confuse people into pushing the SIM ejector tool into this hole instead of the SIM tray itself. At the bottom, the phone has a Micro-USB port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, the primary mic, and a bottom-firing loudspeaker. Honor ships a 10W charger in the box to top the phone up. The Honor 10 Lite has a dual camera setup at the back along with a single LED flash and the fingerprint scanner. Honor has curved the sides of the phone which makes it comfortable to hold. Honor claims that the 10 Lite has a 91 percent screen-to-body ratio thanks to its big display. The 6.21-inch panel has a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a full-HD+ resolution. There is no mention of any sort of protection for the display, so you may want to be careful while handling the device.

Our review unit was running EMUI 9.0.1 on top with the November security patch. It's similar to what we have seen with previous versions of EMUI but it does have a few additions. The first is the Digital Balance app, which is similar to Digital Wellbeing on stock Android. It gives you a breakdown of how you have spent your time on this smartphone. You'll also find a screen management setting that lets you limit screen time in general or for specific apps. Finally, it has the option to switch the screen to grayscale when it's bedtime. As a parent, you can also set screen time and app restrictions here, and secure them with a passcode. Just like most other recently launched smartphones, you get the option to enable gestures-based navigation. This hides the standard Android navigation bar, and you have to swipe to navigate instead. There are other gesture controls such as flip to mute and three-finger screenshot. Honor has also baked in theme support which makes it easy for you to change how the UI looks, right from the icon pack to the lock screen style and font. The Kirin 710 is capable of running the day-to-day tasks without breaking into a sweat. Our review unit was the variant with 4GB of RAM, and we found that it was capable of delivering a smooth experience for day-to-day use. We did not find any lag or stutter, and the phone could multitask easily. During our use, we found the fingerprint scanner to be slow to unlock the smartphone. The Honor 10 Lite also has a face unlock feature which uses the selfie camera. Face recognition was faster than the fingerprint scanner and worked in most lighting scenarios. Honor 10 Lite packs dual 4G VoLTE support    We put the Honor 10 Lite through a couple of benchmarks to see how it fares. In AnTuTu, the phone scored 1,29,535, and it also managed 1539 and 5502 in Geekbench 4's single-core and multi-core tests respectively. The phone managed 36fps in GFXBench T-Rex and 13fps in Manhattan 3.1. In 3DMark Slingshot, it scored 947, and it maxed out in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme. The Kirin 710 scores higher than the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 in CPU benchmarks but falls behind in GPU tests. The Honor 10 Lite ran games like PUBG Mobile at the Medium setting with the graphics at Balanced and Frame Rate set to Medium. With these settings, we did not notice lag while gaming. We observed that the battery drain was 11 percent after 36 minutes of PUBG Mobile. The 3400mAh battery in the Honor 10 Lite lasted for 11 hours and 20 minutes in our HD video loop test. Our usage consisted of an active WhatsApp account, about an hour of gaming, 50 minutes of navigation using Google Maps and a few YouTube videos, and we were still left with 46 percent at the end of 24 hours. Honor does not supply a fast charger in the box, and the standard 10W charger is slow to charge the phone. Honor has gone with a dual rear camera setup for the 10 Lite consisting of a 13-megapixel primary camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. For selfies, you get a 24-megapixel shooter that sits in the notch. The camera software is similar to what we have seen on other Honor phones, and the company boasts of AI for both the primary as well as the selfie cameras. There are Aperture, Night, Portrait, Panorama, Pro, and Time-lapse modes, apart from the usual photo and video modes. HDR is a different mode instead of a quick toggle, which would have been preferred. HiVision, the AI feature we have seen on the Huawei Mate 20 Pro (Review), is also available, but is limited to identifying objects, translating text, and scanning QR codes. The Honor 10 Lite is quick to focus and can meter scenes correctly. With the AI mode enabled, the smartphone could detect what it was pointed towards. The output in this mode, however, was too saturated. While skies looked bluer and grass looked greener on the phone's display, this made shots look more artificial overall. Tap to see full-sized Honor 10 Lite camera samples   In several instances, we noted that photos taken without AI were better than ones taking using the AI mode, with this behaviour particularly noticeable with macro shots. The Honor 10 Lite also managed decent separation between the subject and the background. Portrait mode on the Honor 10 Lite did not deliver good results. Edge detection wasn't accurate, and the phone did not blur backgrounds completely in a few instances. In landscape shots, the Honor 10 Lite failed to capture details in objects at a distance. Low-light performance too was below average. If AI is enabled, it enables night mode automatically which keeps the shutter open for longer. This resulted in blurry shots if the subjects moved at all. Photos taken at night did not have much noise, but missed out on details. The selfie camera has beautification enabled by default, which will smoothen faces. You can switch it off completely or tweak the level of beautification. There's a Bokeh mode as well, which lets you blur backgrounds. However, it does not let you tweak the level of the blur. Video recording maxes out at 1080p for both the primary as well as the selfie cameras. You also have the option to record footage at 60fps with the rear camera. However, this phone lacks image stabilisation which results in shaky output. VerdictThe lower priced variant of the Honor 10 Lite is yet another smartphone in the very competitive sub-Rs. 15,000 price segment. In order to stand out, the 10 Lite sports a glossy finish. It also is the first phone from Honor to have a dewdrop notch and to ship with Android Pie out-of-the-box. The Kirin 710 SoC is powerful and does manage to stand up against the Snapdragon 660 SoC which is quite popular in this segment. Where the Honor 10 Lite falters are its cameras. It faces stiff competition from the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 (Review), the Realme U1 (Review), and the Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review), which recently got a price cut. While the 4GB/ 64GB variant is worth considering at Rs. 13,999, we think the 6GB/ 64GB variant priced at Rs. 17,999 is much less appealing compared to other options under Rs. 20,000."
2457,21,honor-10-lite-review-1977670,8,10,2019-01-15,1977670,Aditya Shenoy,Honor 10 Lite Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/honor-10-lite-review-1977670," Huawei's sub-brand Honor flooded the smartphone market with multiple offerings last year. The company focussed mainly on the budget segment, with good designs and efficient hardware. We also got the Honor Play, a powerful gaming-centric smartphone aimed at budget-conscious buyers. The first smartphone for 2019 from the Chinese manufacturer is the Honor 10 Lite. It is powered by the relatively new Kirin 710 SoC and has a big display with a small dewdrop notch. What is interesting is that the Honor 10 Lite price in India puts it in a hot segment, where multiple manufacturers are already exchanging blows. Can the Honor 10 Lite deliver the knockout punch? We review it to find out.    You know this is an Honor phone when you first look at its glossy back panel. Honor is known to use this kind of finish on its devices, and the Honor 10 Lite comes in three different glossy colours: Sapphire Blue, Sky Blue, and Midnight Black. We had the Sapphire Blue variant for review, and it reminded us of the Honor 8X (Review) and the Honor 9N (Review). While the back does attract a lot of attention, it also picks up smudges very easily. Honor ships a transparent case in the box which helps with this. The 10 Lite is the first smartphone from Honor with a dewdrop notch. The tiny notch sits in the centre at the top of the display and only houses the selfie camera. In order to make the notch this small, Honor has moved the earpiece towards the frame of the smartphone. The notification LED has been moved to the bottom bezel, and you'll only notice it when it lights up. The front is dominated by a 6.21-inch display surrounded by thin bezels all around it. Honor claims that the chip-on-film screen technology it has used enables it to avoid having a thick chin by curving the layer with the circuitry downwards. The frame as well as the back of the phone are made out of plastic and don't feel premium to the touch. This might be an attempt to keep the cost and the weight of the device down. The dewdrop notch on the Honor 10 Lite   Honor has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right. The power button is easy to hit but you might have to shuffle the phone in your hand to reach the volume buttons. The left side of the phone is bare, as the SIM tray now sits on the top alongside a secondary microphone. We fear that the placement of the secondary microphone might confuse people into pushing the SIM ejector tool into this hole instead of the SIM tray itself. At the bottom, the phone has a Micro-USB port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, the primary mic, and a bottom-firing loudspeaker. Honor ships a 10W charger in the box to top the phone up. The Honor 10 Lite has a dual camera setup at the back along with a single LED flash and the fingerprint scanner. Honor has curved the sides of the phone which makes it comfortable to hold. Honor claims that the 10 Lite has a 91 percent screen-to-body ratio thanks to its big display. The 6.21-inch panel has a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a full-HD+ resolution. There is no mention of any sort of protection for the display, so you may want to be careful while handling the device. Honor does pre-apply a screen protector which should keep it safe from minor scratches. Powering the Honor 10 Lite is the Huawei Kirin 710 SoC, which is also seen powering phones like the Huawei Nova 3i (Review) and the Honor 8X. It is an octa-core processor based on a 12nm process and is clocked at 2.2GHz. The Honor 10 Lite comes in 4GB RAM and 6GB RAM variants, though storage remains the same at 64GB with both. If you aren't satisfied with the storage, you can expand it by up to 512GB using the hybrid dual-SIM slot. If you aren't expanding storage, you can use two Nano-SIMs. The device has support for dual 4G VoLTE. Other connectivity options include Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, GPS, and GLONASS.

2256,21,honor-7c-review-1860910,7,10,2018-06-01,1860910,Shobhit Varma,Honor 7C Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/honor-7c-review-1860910," Honor has been on a roll of late. After launching the AI-enhanced Honor 10 (Review) in India, Huawei's sub-brand has now released two budget smartphones in the form of the Honor 7A and Honor 7C. Both models are equipped with features such as face recognition, 18:9 displays, and dual rear cameras. We have the Honor 7C in for review, which is priced starting at Rs. 9,999 and competes head-on with the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 (Review), Xiaomi Redmi 5 (Review), and the recently launched Oppo Realme 1 (Review). Does Honor's new smartphone have what it takes to stand out in the hyper-competitive budget smartphone market? Let's find out in our full review.    With a flat metal backplate, 2.5D curved glass on the front, and a display that dominates the front fascia, the Honor 7C feels reasonably sleek and premium. The lack of antenna lines, subtle Honor branding, minimal regulatory information lend a very clean and minimal look to the back panel. The horizontal dual camera setup is integrated smartly and barely protrudes at all. While the rear panel is mostly made of metal, there are plastic inserts on the top and bottom. The Honor 7C is available in Black, Blue, and Gold colour options. We reviewed the Blue variant, the shade of which is unique and distinctive. While the phone is not too heavy (164g), it is very wide which hinders one-handed use considerably. Build quality though is top-notch. The phone feels solid in the hand and it survived multiple drops during our review period. The rear-mounted fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate, and is ergonomically placed. It can be used for a variety of shortcuts such as taking a picture, answering calls, and sliding down the notification panel.    The left of the Honor 7C is blank save for the SIM tray which has separate slots for Nano-SIM 1, Nano-SIM 2, and a microSD card. The right side has the volume rocker and power button which are tactile and well within reach. On the bottom of the phone is a Micro-USB port, flanked by a 3.5mm headphone socket and a speaker that is very shrill and tinny. The lack of a USB-Type C port for charging and data transfers is quite disappointing. The Honor 7C is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 SoC, which is also found in the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi 5 and Oppo A71 (2018). The Honor 7C and Honor 7A are the first Honor smartphones in a while to ditch the company's own Kirin processors in favour of Qualcomm chips. This smartphone is available in two variants: one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage priced at Rs. 9,999, and one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage priced at Rs. 11,999. You can expand the storage using a microSD card of up to 256GB. The Honor 7C has a non-removable 3,000mAh battery and runs EMUI 8.0 on top of Android 8.0 Oreo. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, GLONASS, 4G VoLTE, a Micro-USB port (USB 2.0 speed), and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It supports dual SIMs but only one can run at 4G speed at a time, with the other limited to 3G.    The Honor 7C features a 5.99-inch HD+ IPS LCD display with an aspect ratio of 18:9. Honor smartphones as of late have had stellar displays but the one on the Honor 7C is a bit of a mixed bag. While the colours are vibrant and viewing angles are spot on, outdoor visibility is average, and the display is very reflective. With most of its competitors offering full-HD panels, the resolution of 720x1440 comes across as slightly disappointing. First-party applications ran fine on the 18:9 display and EMUI 8.0 allows you to stretch third-party applications that do not support the aspect ratio natively. While the Honor 7C tackled basic day-to-day tasks reasonably well, it struggled with intensive workloads. With multiple apps open in the background, we experienced occasional lags. We also dealt with keyboard lags and choppy UI animations on several occasions during our review period. We were slightly surprised by these performance issues as the Snapdragon 450 processor has made a better case for itself in the past with the Xiaomi Redmi 5. On a positive note, the Honor 7C did not get warm when pushed, and handled heavy games fairly well. Asphalt 8 did stutter a bit while loading, but gameplay was smooth.    Benchmark scores were very similar to those of the Xiaomi Redmi 5. We got 72,990 in AnTuTu, 20fps in GFXbench T-Rex, 13fps in GFX Bench Manhattan 3.1, and 780 and 3992 in Geekbench's single- and multi-core tests respectively. The Honor 7C also supports face recognition, using the 8-megapixel front camera. It works quite well for the most part and is near instantaneous in good light, but struggles in direct sunlight and when lighting is not favourable. The Honor 7C runs Huawei's EMUI 8.0 custom skin atop Android 8.0 Oreo. EMUI has matured over the years and is now one of the most versatile and feature-loaded skins out there. Notable features include a one-handed mode, knuckle gestures, an intelligent messages app that filters out spam, and the ability to automatically switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data depending on which connection is stronger. This time around, Honor has also added a Ride Mode for bikers and single-touch fingerprint access to Paytm.    EMUI 8.0 is still cluttered in some places and laden with bloat. A multitude of Honor's applications compete with Google's own, and the phone comes with five Gameloft games and a host of third-party apps such as TrueCaller, Netflix, Messenger, and UC Browser pre-installed. Honor has not announced an update roadmap for its recent devices and there is no information regarding any potential Android P update for this phone. Battery life is decent but not overly impressive. The Honor 7C managed to last 10 hours and 40 minutes in our HD video battery loop test. In our experience, the smartphone just about managed to power through a day of moderate use, with a charge needed by around 10pm. EMUI 8.0 has a host of battery saving features, one of which reduces the screen resolution when you're running low on power. The smartphone does not support quick charging, and takes more than two and a half hours to charge fully using the included charger. The Honor 7C features a dual-camera setup at the back comprised of a 13-megapixel primary sensor, alongside a 2-megapixel secondary sensor for capturing depth data. At the front, the Honor 7C has an 8-megapixel foxed focus snapper. The camera app is fairly easy to use but lacks a fully featured Pro mode. The cameras on the Honor 7C are average at best. While the cameras on the Redmi Note 5 and Realme 1 are also not particularly impressive, the image quality that they deliver is a step above that of the Honor 7C. Shots taken during the day look good on the phone's display, but closer examination reveals a lack of detail.  Tap to see full-sized Honor 7C camera samples   In our experience, shots taken at night came out blurry and grainy, and had a considerable amount of noise. Videos were distinctly average and suffered from a lack of detail and constant focus-shifting. There is a wide aperture mode on offer with seven levels of blur to choose from. The blur effect is not the most accurate, and edge detection around the subject was poor. The 8-megapixel front shooter takes decent photos in good light but struggles in low light, producing noisy and murky shots. Beauty mode is on by default when you take selfies, and makes images look over-processed and artificial. Honor 7C in pictures   VerdictThe Honor 7C looks sleek, is built well, and is loaded with features. Battery life is decent and so is the display. That said, EUMI is laggy and laden with third-party bloat, and both the front and rear cameras are average at best. Potential buyers should take a look at the Oppo Realme 1 (Review), which lacks a fingerprint sensor but offers a better-rounded package, or the Redmi Note 5 (Review) which offers far more value for money. The Honor 7C is also priced dangerously close to Honor's own 9 Lite (Review), which has a higher-resolution display, a better set of cameras, and a sleek glass body."

After launching the AI-enhanced Honor 10 (Review) in India, Huawei's sub-brand has now released two budget smartphones in the form of the Honor 7A and Honor 7C. Both models are equipped with features such as face recognition, 18:9 displays, and dual rear cameras. We have the Honor 7C in for review, which is priced starting at Rs. 9,999 and competes head-on with the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 (Review), Xiaomi Redmi 5 (Review), and the recently launched Oppo Realme 1 (Review). Does Honor's new smartphone have what it takes to stand out in the hyper-competitive budget smartphone market? Let's find out in our full review.    With a flat metal backplate, 2.5D curved glass on the front, and a display that dominates the front fascia, the Honor 7C feels reasonably sleek and premium. The lack of antenna lines, subtle Honor branding, minimal regulatory information lend a very clean and minimal look to the back panel. The horizontal dual camera setup is integrated smartly and barely protrudes at all. While the rear panel is mostly made of metal, there are plastic inserts on the top and bottom. The Honor 7C is available in Black, Blue, and Gold colour options. We reviewed the Blue variant, the shade of which is unique and distinctive. While the phone is not too heavy (164g), it is very wide which hinders one-handed use considerably. Build quality though is top-notch. The phone feels solid in the hand and it survived multiple drops during our review period. The rear-mounted fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate, and is ergonomically placed. It can be used for a variety of shortcuts such as taking a picture, answering calls, and sliding down the notification panel.    The left of the Honor 7C is blank save for the SIM tray which has separate slots for Nano-SIM 1, Nano-SIM 2, and a microSD card. The right side has the volume rocker and power button which are tactile and well within reach. On the bottom of the phone is a Micro-USB port, flanked by a 3.5mm headphone socket and a speaker that is very shrill and tinny. The lack of a USB-Type C port for charging and data transfers is quite disappointing. The Honor 7C is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 SoC, which is also found in the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi 5 and Oppo A71 (2018). The Honor 7C and Honor 7A are the first Honor smartphones in a while to ditch the company's own Kirin processors in favour of Qualcomm chips. This smartphone is available in two variants: one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage priced at Rs. 9,999, and one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage priced at Rs. 11,999. You can expand the storage using a microSD card of up to 256GB. The Honor 7C has a non-removable 3,000mAh battery and runs EMUI 8.0 on top of Android 8.0 Oreo. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, GLONASS, 4G VoLTE, a Micro-USB port (USB 2.0 speed), and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It supports dual SIMs but only one can run at 4G speed at a time, with the other limited to 3G.    The Honor 7C features a 5.99-inch HD+ IPS LCD display with an aspect ratio of 18:9. Honor smartphones as of late have had stellar displays but the one on the Honor 7C is a bit of a mixed bag. While the colours are vibrant and viewing angles are spot on, outdoor visibility is average, and the display is very reflective. With most of its competitors offering full-HD panels, the resolution of 720x1440 comes across as slightly disappointing. First-party applications ran fine on the 18:9 display and EMUI 8.0 allows you to stretch third-party applications that do not support the aspect ratio natively. While the Honor 7C tackled basic day-to-day tasks reasonably well, it struggled with intensive workloads. With multiple apps open in the background, we experienced occasional lags. We also dealt with keyboard lags and choppy UI animations on several occasions during our review period. We were slightly surprised by these performance issues as the Snapdragon 450 processor has made a better case for itself in the past with the Xiaomi Redmi 5. On a positive note, the Honor 7C did not get warm when pushed, and handled heavy games fairly well. Asphalt 8 did stutter a bit while loading, but gameplay was smooth.    Benchmark scores were very similar to those of the Xiaomi Redmi 5. We got 72,990 in AnTuTu, 20fps in GFXbench T-Rex, 13fps in GFX Bench Manhattan 3.1, and 780 and 3992 in Geekbench's single- and multi-core tests respectively. The Honor 7C also supports face recognition, using the 8-megapixel front camera. It works quite well for the most part and is near instantaneous in good light, but struggles in direct sunlight and when lighting is not favourable. The Honor 7C runs Huawei's EMUI 8.0 custom skin atop Android 8.0 Oreo. EMUI has matured over the years and is now one of the most versatile and feature-loaded skins out there. Notable features include a one-handed mode, knuckle gestures, an intelligent messages app that filters out spam, and the ability to automatically switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data depending on which connection is stronger. This time around, Honor has also added a Ride Mode for bikers and single-touch fingerprint access to Paytm.    EMUI 8.0 is still cluttered in some places and laden with bloat. A multitude of Honor's applications compete with Google's own, and the phone comes with five Gameloft games and a host of third-party apps such as TrueCaller, Netflix, Messenger, and UC Browser pre-installed. Honor has not announced an update roadmap for its recent devices and there is no information regarding any potential Android P update for this phone. Battery life is decent but not overly impressive. The Honor 7C managed to last 10 hours and 40 minutes in our HD video battery loop test. In our experience, the smartphone just about managed to power through a day of moderate use, with a charge needed by around 10pm. EMUI 8.0 has a host of battery saving features, one of which reduces the screen resolution when you're running low on power. The smartphone does not support quick charging, and takes more than two and a half hours to charge fully using the included charger. The Honor 7C features a dual-camera setup at the back comprised of a 13-megapixel primary sensor, alongside a 2-megapixel secondary sensor for capturing depth data. At the front, the Honor 7C has an 8-megapixel foxed focus snapper. The camera app is fairly easy to use but lacks a fully featured Pro mode. The cameras on the Honor 7C are average at best.

The Honor 7C also supports face recognition, using the 8-megapixel front camera. It works quite well for the most part and is near instantaneous in good light, but struggles in direct sunlight and when lighting is not favourable. The Honor 7C runs Huawei's EMUI 8.0 custom skin atop Android 8.0 Oreo. EMUI has matured over the years and is now one of the most versatile and feature-loaded skins out there. Notable features include a one-handed mode, knuckle gestures, an intelligent messages app that filters out spam, and the ability to automatically switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data depending on which connection is stronger. This time around, Honor has also added a Ride Mode for bikers and single-touch fingerprint access to Paytm.    EMUI 8.0 is still cluttered in some places and laden with bloat. A multitude of Honor's applications compete with Google's own, and the phone comes with five Gameloft games and a host of third-party apps such as TrueCaller, Netflix, Messenger, and UC Browser pre-installed. Honor has not announced an update roadmap for its recent devices and there is no information regarding any potential Android P update for this phone. Battery life is decent but not overly impressive. The Honor 7C managed to last 10 hours and 40 minutes in our HD video battery loop test. In our experience, the smartphone just about managed to power through a day of moderate use, with a charge needed by around 10pm. EMUI 8.0 has a host of battery saving features, one of which reduces the screen resolution when you're running low on power. The smartphone does not support quick charging, and takes more than two and a half hours to charge fully using the included charger. The Honor 7C features a dual-camera setup at the back comprised of a 13-megapixel primary sensor, alongside a 2-megapixel secondary sensor for capturing depth data. At the front, the Honor 7C has an 8-megapixel foxed focus snapper. The camera app is fairly easy to use but lacks a fully featured Pro mode. The cameras on the Honor 7C are average at best. While the cameras on the Redmi Note 5 and Realme 1 are also not particularly impressive, the image quality that they deliver is a step above that of the Honor 7C. Shots taken during the day look good on the phone's display, but closer examination reveals a lack of detail.  Tap to see full-sized Honor 7C camera samples   In our experience, shots taken at night came out blurry and grainy, and had a considerable amount of noise. Videos were distinctly average and suffered from a lack of detail and constant focus-shifting. There is a wide aperture mode on offer with seven levels of blur to choose from. The blur effect is not the most accurate, and edge detection around the subject was poor. The 8-megapixel front shooter takes decent photos in good light but struggles in low light, producing noisy and murky shots. Beauty mode is on by default when you take selfies, and makes images look over-processed and artificial. Honor 7C in pictures   VerdictThe Honor 7C looks sleek, is built well, and is loaded with features. Battery life is decent and so is the display. That said, EUMI is laggy and laden with third-party bloat, and both the front and rear cameras are average at best. Potential buyers should take a look at the Oppo Realme 1 (Review), which lacks a fingerprint sensor but offers a better-rounded package, or the Redmi Note 5 (Review) which offers far more value for money. The Honor 7C is also priced dangerously close to Honor's own 9 Lite (Review), which has a higher-resolution display, a better set of cameras, and a sleek glass body."
2212,21,honor-7x-review-price-in-india-12999-camera-battery-performance-specifications-features-1783527,7,10,2017-12-06,1783527,Aditya Shenoy,Honor 7X Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/honor-7x-review-price-in-india-12999-camera-battery-performance-specifications-features-1783527," The Honor 7X is the newest smartphone to sport an 18:9 aspect ratio screen, and has been launched at a starting price of Rs. 12,999. It is the successor to the Honor 6X (Review) and comes shortly after the launch of the Honor 9i (Review), which was the brand’s first phone with a FullView display. The Honor 7X brings this feature to the more affordable X series, making it accessible to a lot more people. One look at the spec sheet and it is evident that Honor has loaded this phone up with loads of features, but is that enough to give it an edge in this competitive price segment? We'll answer that question and more in our Honor 7X review.    We like smartphones with big displays, and the Honor 7X ticks this box. The front is dominated by a 5.93-inch screen with thin borders on the sides but comparatively thicker ones at the top and bottom. The metal earpiece sits above the screen, with an 8-megapixel front camera alongside. Just like the Honor 9i, the fingerprint scanner on the 7X is at the back. We found it easy to reach and it was quick to unlock the phone in our experience. Honor has used a metal unibody for this smartphone which gives it that premium look and feel. It has antenna bands running along the top and the bottom which remind us of the Honor 8 Pro (Review). The metal body curves on the sides and along the edges, giving this phone a good in-hand feel. The power and volume buttons are positioned on the right and we found that we had to stretch to hit the volume buttons. The loudspeaker, 3.5mm headphones socket, primary microphone, and Micro-USB port are all on the bottom. The dual camera setup at the back is accompanied by a single-LED flash. Honor has gone with two distinct rings instead of a single unit like we’ve seen on most phones recently. The camera arrangement protrudes a little.  The Honor 7X weighs 165 grams which feels about right in the hand. It measures 7.6mm in thickness while packing in a 3340mAh battery. Honor supplies a 10W charger in the box that is capable of charging the phone completely in two and a half hours. Many Honor phones are powered by Huawei-made processors, and the 7X packs in a HiSilicon Kirin 659 SoC, the same processor powering the Honor 9i. It is an octa-core chip with four cores clocked at 2.36GHz and the other four clocked at 1.7GHz. With the Honor 7X, you get to choose between 32GB and 64GB of internal storage, but both variants have 4GB of RAM. Both also let you expand storage up to 256GB using a microSD card in the Hybrid dual-SIM slot. If you aren't using that capability, the 7X can accommodate two Nano-SIMs. There is support for 4G and VoLTE on both SIMs, but only one can access the 4G network at a time. The Honor 7X's screen boasts a full-HD+ resolution with 2.5D curved glass, but there is no mention of any type of protection. Viewing angles are good and Honor lets you tweak the colour temperature to suit your preferences. Brightness is good indoors but we had to bump it up all the way or shade the screen with one hand when using this phone outdoors.  Like all other Honor devices, the 7X runs on Huawei's custom EMUI skin, specifically EMUI 5.1 on top of Android Nougat. You get the option to choose between layouts with and without an app drawer. The UI also includes theme support for a degree of customisation. Honor has been thoughtful enough to include a single-handed mode which makes the phone easier to use despite its big screen. You can also force apps to run at the 18:9 aspect ratio if they aren't scaling automatically. Along with the essentials, you also get a fair share of bloatware. The Honor 7X comes with Honor’s support app called HiCare, and HiGame, a gaming app store. There are also Web shortcuts called Hi Honor and Honor Community. You get demo versions of Spider-Man: Ultimate Power, Asphalt Nitro, Bubble Bash 3, Modern Combat 4 Zero Hour, and Danger Dash preinstalled, but you can get rid of them to free up space. The Honor 7X sports the same combination of procesor and RAM as the Honor 9i and scores similarly in benchmarks. In Antutu, it managed to score 62,504, and we got 906 and 3569 points in Geekbench's single-core and multi-core tests respectively. GFXBench returned 18fps which is just about average. We tried playing Shadow Fight 3 which is a graphics-intensive game, and while it ran without any lags, it did take while to load.  Movies and games are immersive thanks to the big display. However, we did notice that the phone would get warm after a long gaming session, and there would be significantly higher battery drain. With light to medium use, the phone lasted us one working day, but playing games and watching videos had a big impact on battery life. The phone lasted only a little over 8 hours in our HD video loop test, which is under-par for a battery of this size. Honor has baked in a few battery saving software tweaks which could come in handy, but we shouldn't have to use them all the time. The camera app is fairly easy to use and apart from the default auto mode, you can select between wide aperture, moving picture and portrait modes. You get a lot of other modes to choose from as well, including a Pro Photo mode that lets you fine-tune camera parameters before taking a shot. You also have the option to download additional features if required. Photos taken with the Honor 7X look good at first glance. However, zoom into landscape shots and you can see that the 7X misses out on details and delivers slightly grainy shots. Macros are good and there is decent separation between subjects and backgrounds. The wide aperture mode gives you better depth of field by digitally adding blur based on the aperture value you select. Tap to see full-sized Honor 7X camera samples Shooting at night needs a steady hand. In auto mode, the phone takes shots but then pauses to sharpen the output. The result is less noise but at the cost of overall detail. Selfies are grainy as well, but are good enough to be shared on social media. The primary camera is capable of 1080p video recording while the selfie camera maxes out at 720p. VerdictWith the Honor 7X, the X series has been brought up to date with the latest trends. You get a big display with the 18:9 aspect ratio and powerful hardware which should keep you happy. We found that camera performance isn’t really impressive, and battery life could have been a little better. If you want a modern-looking phone, then the Honor 7X is a good choice, but if you want an all-rounder the Xiaomi Mi A1 (Review) would be a better pick."

1965,21,honor-8-lite-review-1708726,7,10,2017-06-12,1708726,Aditya Shenoy,Honor 8 Lite Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/honor-8-lite-review-1708726," Huawei's sub-brand Honor has been selling phones in India for a while now. Huawei itself only sells the Huawei P9 (Review) and Nexus 6P (Review) officially in India, but Honor caters to a much wider audienc with phones like the Holly 2 Plus (Review) in the sub-Rs. 10,000 space, and the upper-end of the market with the Honor 8 (Review). It also launched the Honor 6X (Review) which is the among the most affordable phones to offer dual rear cameras. The recently announced Honor 8 Lite fits somewhere in the middle of the price range that the Honor brand targets. The company claims that this phone's camera can deliver professional output, and that its in-house Kirin processor can handle pretty much anything you throw at it. So does the Honor 8 Lite live up to these claims? Let's find out. As the name suggests the Honor 8 Lite is a toned-down version of the Honor 8 (Review) and has a lot of similarities. There's a plastic frame in the centre sandwiched between two slabs of 2.5D glass. The front is dominated by a 5.2-inch display and has on-screen buttons. There's an 8-megapixel selfie camera above the screen, along with a metallic earpiece. The Honor 8 Lite is quite good to look at thanks to its glass back, but this unfortunately is a fingerprint magnet and makes the phone slippery as well. We saw it sliding when placed on a non-flat surface. The black colour makes smudges very evident and you'll have to keep wiping this phone.   The 12-megapixel camera and LED flash are positioned towards the top left corner of the rear. On the bottom, there is a Micro-USB port with grilles on either side. The right grille houses a speaker while the left only has a microphone. A better position for the speaker would have helped, as our hands muffled it while playing games. The secondary microphone and 3.5mm headphones socket are on the top. The Honor 8 Lite sports a 5.2-inch display with a full-HD resolution, which makes for a high pixel density. Colour reproduction is neutral but there is an option to tweak the colour temperature. If you aren't a fan of punchy colours, you'll like the display. It has good viewing angles but isn't very easy to read under direct sunlight. Powering the Honor 8 Lite is Huawei's own Kirin 655 SoC. It is an octa-core processor with two sets of four ARM Cortex-A53 cores. One set is clocked at 1.7GHz while the other is clocked higher at 2.1GHz. It has an integrated Mali-T830 GPU, as well as a co-processor called i5 which handles sensor input when the main cores are in standby, to save power. The Honor 8 Lite also has 4GB of RAM which in our opinion is more than enough to run all kinds of apps. There is dual-SIM connectivity and the device supports 4G and VoLTE. The hybrid dual-SIM design of the Honor 8 Lite means that you'll need to choose between a second SIM and storage expansion. With 64GB of storage onboard, chances are that you won't need more. In case you do, the phone accepts microSD cards of up to 128GB.  Honor 8 Lite comes with Bluetooth 4.1, WiFi b/g/n and USB-OTG support. This phone sadly misses out on support for WiFi 802.11ac and NFC, which would have helped it score some more points in terms of hardware. In the box, Honor provides a clear case for the phone, which we recommend you use to prevent the rear panel from getting scratched. Honor claims that the camera on this phone can deliver professional results. For it to do so, there's a 12-megapixel sensor with 1.25-micron pixels. There's a single-LED flash instead of a dual-tone LED flash like other smartphones in this segment. The Honor 8 Lite relies on phase detection autofocus (PDAF). The camera app is quite simple and easy to use. There are lots of modes to choose from before you take a photo. It has a dedicated Pro mode for photos and videos that lets you take control of all shooting parameters, so if you know your way around cameras you can set your shots up just right. In daylight, the Honor 8 Lite's rear camera focuses quickly and the output is good. Even if you leave it set to Auto mode, the phone manages quite well. It focuses quickly and colours in photos are quite accurate. We found that the results weren't as accurate in low light, and quality improved quite a bit when we adjusted the exposure manually. Macros were good, and the full-HD display does make photos pop. The camera app misses out on a dedicated night mode. To compensate, it detects low light and sharpens images. Photos taken at night are good but you can see that corrections have been applied. A dedicated night mode would have been helpful instead of replying purely on the phone to figure it out. In terms of video, the Honor 8 Lite can record at up to full-HD resolution. You also have the option to record slo-mo videos, and take panoramas and timelapses. For selfies, The Honor 8 lite packs an 8-megapixel front facing camera. There is beautification mode in the app which lightens skin tones. The phone misses out on a front flash but can use the screen as a flash which is somewhat helpful in low light. Photos taken with the selfie camera are good enough to go up on social media. You can also record HD videos using the front-facing camera. Tap to see full-sized Honor 8 Lite camera samples Honor gets some brownie points for shipping the 8 Lite with Android Nougat. While most other smartphones still ship with Android Marshmallow, this keeps things a bit more fresh. On top of Nougat is Honor's EMUI skin. The UI is quite basic and is very easy to use. If you do not like the way it looks you have the option to change the theme, icon pack and font. The debate of an app drawer vs leaving all icons on the home screens can be put to rest with the Honor 8 Lite, as EMUI lets you select what you prefer. It also has a one-handed mode that can be activated easily by sliding a finger across the onscreen buttons. The phone can actively switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data for better connectivity, similar to the Wi-Fi Assist feature on iOS. HiCloud is Huawei's cloud storage service, and it lets you save your contacts, messages, and settings on the cloud. While all this is good, the phone also has a few apps pre-installed by Honor. Health keeps a track of the number of steps you take, and HiCare has instructions on how to use the phone and also lets you book a service appointment. Third-party apps pre-installed on the Honor 8 Lite include TripAdvisor, Hotoday, Flipboard, and Opera Max. One of the most unique things about the Honor 8 Lite is the processor powering it. While most smartphones use either Qualcomm Snapdragon or MediaTek processors, Honor uses ones manufactured by Huawei. We found that the phone handled general use quite well. There wasn't any lag or stutter while going through usual tasks. The Honor 8 Lite has 4GB of RAM which helps it deliver smooth performance, and we observed that there was over 2GB free when using the phone. RAM management is good and the phone only kills apps if they have been in the background for a really long time.  In terms of benchmarks, the Honor 8 Lite returned 54,929 in Antutu, as well as 821 and 3,361 for GeekBench's single-core and multi-core tests respectively. In comparison, the Moto G5 Plus (Review) which sports a Snapdragon 625 with similar architecture, scored 63,855 in Antutu, and 771 and 2,976 in Geekbench. At the same time, we found that graphics scores were lower in benchmarks. The Honor 8 Lite managed 18fps in GFXBench, while the Moto managed 23fps. We could see frame drops while playing Asphalt 8. The Kirin 655 is good at general tasks but the GPU takes a hit when it comes to gaming. The rear-mounted fingerprint sensor has a matte finish, and isn't a button like the one on the Honor 8 so you miss out on the smart key functionality that the bigger phone offers. That said, the fingerprint sensor on the Honor 8 Lite is very accurate and unlocks the phone quickly. The non-removable 3000mAh battery can power the Honor 8 Lite for one full day with medium to light use. It managed to go on for 9 hours, 42 minutes in our HD video loop test. Similarly priced phones like the Gionee A1 (Review) and Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Review) perform better in terms of battery life. Another blow to the Honor 8 Lite is the absence of quick charging. The supplied 5W charger isn't very fast either. While most smartphones in the budget segment now have metal bodies, the Honor 8 Lite stands out with its glass design. However, those good looks come at the cost of the phone being slippery and a fingerprint magnet. The Honor 8 Lite also delivers to some extent on the promise it made on the camera front. Huawei's home-grown Kirin processor performs tasks quite well but stumbles a little when it comes to heavy tasks such as gaming.  Considering its price of Rs 17,999, the Honor 8 Lite does quite a few things well. It runs Android 7.0 Nougat with Honor's latest EMUI custom skin on top, which is easy to use. The camera performance is good and the option for complete manual control is helpful. However, if battery life and fast charging are very important to you, you might have to look elsewhere."

2452,21,honor-8c-review-1954784,7,10,2018-11-29,1954784,Shobhit Varma,Honor 8C Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/honor-8c-review-1954784," Huawei's sub-brand Honor has been very aggressive in India of late, with numerous smartphone launches across multiple price segments. The Honor 8C arrives just six months after the Honor 7C, and features a sizeable 4,000mAh battery, an expansive 6.26-inch display with an aspect ratio of 19:9, AI-enhanced cameras, and Android 8.1 Oreo out of the box. The first phone with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 SoC under its hood, the Honor 8C is offered in two variants: one with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage priced at Rs. 11,999, and the one we have on hand, with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, which retails for Rs 12,999. The Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 15,000 segment is incredibly cut-throat and is populated by capable smartphone such as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review), Nokia 5.1 Plus (Review), Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro (Review), and Realme 1 (Review). Let's see if the Honor 8C  can compete with such heavy hitters.    The body of the Honor 8C is all plastic and the build quality is satisfactory, but this smartphone does not feel as premium as its glass- and metal-backed rivals. In fact, even the older Honor 7C (Review) has a metal backplate with plastic inserts on the top and bottom. This phone is also a bit too tall to be used comfortably with one hand. The notched display is not exactly borderless, and the chin is pretty significant. There is an option in the settings menu to mask the notch, which basically darkens the screen area on either side of it. Users can choose between on-screen buttons and EMUI's gestures, which we found to be slightly difficult to use. The glossy plastic back attracts a ton of fingerprints and makes the phone very slippery. A soft TPU case is included in the box. It's not of the highest quality, but does help protect the phone from scratches and improve grip. The retail box also includes a 10W charger and a Micro-USB cable. A headset is not included, which might disappoint a few users.    The rear panel houses the vertically stacked cameras and a centrally located fingerprint sensor. Honor has tried to replicate the color gradient used on its pricier glass-backed offerings such as the Honor 10 (Review), but hasn't succeeded fully. The black and blue gradient on the back of our review unit looked a little garish to us. The left of the smartphone houses the SIM tray, which has two Nano-SIM slots and a dedicated microSD card slot. The right side is home to the power button and volume rocker, both of which are small but tactile. On the bottom of the phone is a Micro-USB port, flanked by the primary microphone and a speaker that is loud but tinny. The secondary microphone and 3.5mm headphone jack are placed on the top. The use of a Micro-USB port is a disappointing at a time when the industry has started transitioning to the USB Type-C standard. The Honor 8C is powered by Qualcomm's new 14nm Snapdragon 632 SoC, which has four high-performance cores and four cores tuned for power efficiency. The review unit we tested was the top-end variant with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, priced at Rs.12,999. A cheaper variant with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage is also offered, which has been priced at Rs. 11,999. Both support storage expansion via a microSD card (up to 256GB). The smartphone has a sizeable 4,000mAh battery and runs EMUI 8.2 atop Android 8.1 Oreo. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, GLONASS, a Micro-USB port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It supports dual SIMs (Nano) and both can simultaneously latch onto 4G networks.    There's a 6.26-inch HD+ (720x1520 pixels) TFT IPS LCD panel up front with an aspect ratio of 19:9. The display is nothing to write home about. While the viewing angles are decent and colours are punchy, the maximum brightness level is not enough, and text and images appear fuzzy due to the HD+ resolution, which is a bit low for a screen of this size. First-party applications are built to accommodate the notch, and EMUI allows you to stretch third-party applications that do not natively support the 19:9 aspect ratio. Performance is a bit of a mixed bag. The smartphone handles day-to-day use quite well but struggles a bit when pushed. We also experienced slight lag and stutter while navigating around the UI and scrolling through heavy websites in Chrome. As the Honor 8C is the first smartphone with the Snapdragon 632 SoC, it's hard to say whether the performance issues are a result of this processor or a lack of optimisation on Honor's part. Games like Asphalt 9 and PUBG exhibited a few dropped frames here and there, but were playable on the whole. You will need to reduce the graphics settings though. The Honor 8C managed 103,258 points in AnTuTu, 1265 and 2465 respectively in Geekbench's single-core and multi-core tests, 5,673 in PC Mark's Work 2.0 benchmark, 14fps in GFXBench Manhattan 3.1, and 36fps in GFXBench T-Rex.    Face recognition is almost instantaneous when there's an adequate amount of light, but you do need to point the smartphone directly at your face. In low light, the phone increases the screen brightness so as to illuminate your face before attempting to scan it, and this helps to a degree. We also found the fingerprint sensor to be quick and accurate. The Honor 8C runs Honor's EMUI 8.2 custom skin atop Android 8.1 Oreo. EMUI is feature-packed but feels cluttered and has plenty of bloatware. There's an odd mix of Google's own apps and Honor's as default. For example, there's  the Chrome browser and Android's default messaging app, but the Dialer, File Manager and Gallery are Honor's custom versions. Facebook, Messenger, Netflix, and Camera 360 come preinstalled, along with a bunch of first-party apps from Huawei such as HiCare, Huawei Health, Themes, Honor Store, and Honor Club, which require a ton of permissions to run.  Option to hide the notch in settings, pre-installed apps, and one-handed mode   On a positive note, EMUI also has  a one-handed mode, a powerful theming engine, and the ability to run two instances of the same application. There is no information as of now regarding any potential Android P update for this phone. The Honor 8C lasted 14 hours and 30 minutes in our HD video battery loop test, which is quite impressive. Real-world performance was solid as well, with the smartphone powering through a day of moderate use. EMUI has a host of power-saving features, one of which reduces the screen resolution when you're running low on power. The smartphone does not support quick charging, and takes more than two and a half hours to charge fully when using the included 10W charger. On the imaging front, the Honor 8C features a 13-megapixel primary rear camera with an aperture of f/1.8, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor with an aperture of f/2.4. At the front, the Honor 8C has an 8-megapixel fixed-focus camera with an aperture of f/2.0. Both the front and rear cameras feature single-LED flashes.    The iOS-inspired camera app is well laid out and has a fully featured Pro mode, which allows you to alter the ISO, exposure, shutter speed, and white balance. The smartphone can recognise certain objects or scenes being shot, and optimise image settings accordingly. At the moment, the smartphone can detect 22 different types of objects and over 500 types of scenes. We were not too pleased with the AI enhancements on offer. Most photos shot in AI mode were oversharpened and had oversaturated colours. With AI turned off, photos taken in adequate light had more natural colours and a reasonable amount of detail. The wide aperture mode allows you take shots with depth-of-field effects, which are above average with decent edge detection. However, the image quality is a bit behind the competition. All photos taken with AI disabled. Tap to see full-sized Honor 8C camera samples   In unfavourable lighting situations, the photos we took with this phone came out looking dark and murky, and the autofocus also struggled at times. The AI enhancements can help the app set itself to pull in more light, but the level of detail suffers and plenty of noise creeps in. The front camera is also just about adequate. In our experience, most images were soft and overexposed. Low-light performance was also quite poor. The front LED flash helps to an extent, but images lack detail, are over-sharpened, and have inaccurate colours. A beauty mode is available for both the front and rear cameras, but the results appear very artificial. AR stickers are also supported, and these are well implemented. Video recording maxes out at 720p for the front camera while the rear one is capable of 1080p recording. Our test videos lacked detail and were shaky due to the lack of any sort of stabilisation. Honor 8C in pictures   VerdictThe Honor 8C does little to stand out in a segment populated by highly competent smartphones such as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review) and Nokia 5.1 Plus (Review). Honor has tried to deliver a solid all-rounder, but in doing so, has produced a phone that does not excel in any particular area. This phone does not look or feel as premium as its rivals. Its low-light camera quality is disappointing, general performance is a mixed bag, and the user interface is cluttered. There are a few spots of sunshine - the battery life is solid, there's a dedicated microSD card slot, and the fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate. Manufacturers including Xiaomi, Nokia, Asus, and Realme have raised the budget smartphone game, and Honor needs to do more if it wants to come out on top."

The Honor 8C is powered by Qualcomm's new 14nm Snapdragon 632 SoC, which has four high-performance cores and four cores tuned for power efficiency. The review unit we tested was the top-end variant with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, priced at Rs.12,999. A cheaper variant with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage is also offered, which has been priced at Rs. 11,999. Both support storage expansion via a microSD card (up to 256GB). The smartphone has a sizeable 4,000mAh battery and runs EMUI 8.2 atop Android 8.1 Oreo. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, GLONASS, a Micro-USB port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It supports dual SIMs (Nano) and both can simultaneously latch onto 4G networks.    There's a 6.26-inch HD+ (720x1520 pixels) TFT IPS LCD panel up front with an aspect ratio of 19:9. The display is nothing to write home about. While the viewing angles are decent and colours are punchy, the maximum brightness level is not enough, and text and images appear fuzzy due to the HD+ resolution, which is a bit low for a screen of this size. First-party applications are built to accommodate the notch, and EMUI allows you to stretch third-party applications that do not natively support the 19:9 aspect ratio. Performance is a bit of a mixed bag. The smartphone handles day-to-day use quite well but struggles a bit when pushed. We also experienced slight lag and stutter while navigating around the UI and scrolling through heavy websites in Chrome. As the Honor 8C is the first smartphone with the Snapdragon 632 SoC, it's hard to say whether the performance issues are a result of this processor or a lack of optimisation on Honor's part. Games like Asphalt 9 and PUBG exhibited a few dropped frames here and there, but were playable on the whole. You will need to reduce the graphics settings though. The Honor 8C managed 103,258 points in AnTuTu, 1265 and 2465 respectively in Geekbench's single-core and multi-core tests, 5,673 in PC Mark's Work 2.0 benchmark, 14fps in GFXBench Manhattan 3.1, and 36fps in GFXBench T-Rex.    Face recognition is almost instantaneous when there's an adequate amount of light, but you do need to point the smartphone directly at your face. In low light, the phone increases the screen brightness so as to illuminate your face before attempting to scan it, and this helps to a degree. We also found the fingerprint sensor to be quick and accurate. The Honor 8C runs Honor's EMUI 8.2 custom skin atop Android 8.1 Oreo. EMUI is feature-packed but feels cluttered and has plenty of bloatware. There's an odd mix of Google's own apps and Honor's as default. For example, there's  the Chrome browser and Android's default messaging app, but the Dialer, File Manager and Gallery are Honor's custom versions. Facebook, Messenger, Netflix, and Camera 360 come preinstalled, along with a bunch of first-party apps from Huawei such as HiCare, Huawei Health, Themes, Honor Store, and Honor Club, which require a ton of permissions to run.  Option to hide the notch in settings, pre-installed apps, and one-handed mode   On a positive note, EMUI also has  a one-handed mode, a powerful theming engine, and the ability to run two instances of the same application. There is no information as of now regarding any potential Android P update for this phone. The Honor 8C lasted 14 hours and 30 minutes in our HD video battery loop test, which is quite impressive. Real-world performance was solid as well, with the smartphone powering through a day of moderate use. EMUI has a host of power-saving features, one of which reduces the screen resolution when you're running low on power. The smartphone does not support quick charging, and takes more than two and a half hours to charge fully when using the included 10W charger. On the imaging front, the Honor 8C features a 13-megapixel primary rear camera with an aperture of f/1.8, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor with an aperture of f/2.4. At the front, the Honor 8C has an 8-megapixel fixed-focus camera with an aperture of f/2.0. Both the front and rear cameras feature single-LED flashes.    The iOS-inspired camera app is well laid out and has a fully featured Pro mode, which allows you to alter the ISO, exposure, shutter speed, and white balance. The smartphone can recognise certain objects or scenes being shot, and optimise image settings accordingly. At the moment, the smartphone can detect 22 different types of objects and over 500 types of scenes. We were not too pleased with the AI enhancements on offer. Most photos shot in AI mode were oversharpened and had oversaturated colours. With AI turned off, photos taken in adequate light had more natural colours and a reasonable amount of detail. The wide aperture mode allows you take shots with depth-of-field effects, which are above average with decent edge detection. However, the image quality is a bit behind the competition. All photos taken with AI disabled. Tap to see full-sized Honor 8C camera samples   In unfavourable lighting situations, the photos we took with this phone came out looking dark and murky, and the autofocus also struggled at times. The AI enhancements can help the app set itself to pull in more light, but the level of detail suffers and plenty of noise creeps in. The front camera is also just about adequate. In our experience, most images were soft and overexposed. Low-light performance was also quite poor. The front LED flash helps to an extent, but images lack detail, are over-sharpened, and have inaccurate colours. A beauty mode is available for both the front and rear cameras, but the results appear very artificial. AR stickers are also supported, and these are well implemented. Video recording maxes out at 720p for the front camera while the rear one is capable of 1080p recording. Our test videos lacked detail and were shaky due to the lack of any sort of stabilisation. Honor 8C in pictures   VerdictThe Honor 8C does little to stand out in a segment populated by highly competent smartphones such as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review) and Nokia 5.1 Plus (Review). Honor has tried to deliver a solid all-rounder, but in doing so, has produced a phone that does not excel in any particular area. This phone does not look or feel as premium as its rivals. Its low-light camera quality is disappointing, general performance is a mixed bag, and the user interface is cluttered. There are a few spots of sunshine - the battery life is solid, there's a dedicated microSD card slot, and the fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate. Manufacturers including Xiaomi, Nokia, Asus, and Realme have raised the budget smartphone game, and Honor needs to do more if it wants to come out on top."
2452,21,honor-8c-review-1954784,7,10,2018-11-29,1954784,Shobhit Varma,Honor 8C Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/honor-8c-review-1954784," Huawei's sub-brand Honor has been very aggressive in India of late, with numerous smartphone launches across multiple price segments. The Honor 8C arrives just six months after the Honor 7C, and features a sizeable 4,000mAh battery, an expansive 6.26-inch display with an aspect ratio of 19:9, AI-enhanced cameras, and Android 8.1 Oreo out of the box. The first phone with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 SoC under its hood, the Honor 8C is offered in two variants: one with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage priced at Rs. 11,999, and the one we have on hand, with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, which retails for Rs 12,999. The Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 15,000 segment is incredibly cut-throat and is populated by capable smartphone such as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review), Nokia 5.1 Plus (Review), Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro (Review), and Realme 1 (Review). Let's see if the Honor 8C  can compete with such heavy hitters.    The body of the Honor 8C is all plastic and the build quality is satisfactory, but this smartphone does not feel as premium as its glass- and metal-backed rivals. In fact, even the older Honor 7C (Review) has a metal backplate with plastic inserts on the top and bottom. This phone is also a bit too tall to be used comfortably with one hand. The notched display is not exactly borderless, and the chin is pretty significant. There is an option in the settings menu to mask the notch, which basically darkens the screen area on either side of it. Users can choose between on-screen buttons and EMUI's gestures, which we found to be slightly difficult to use. The glossy plastic back attracts a ton of fingerprints and makes the phone very slippery. A soft TPU case is included in the box. It's not of the highest quality, but does help protect the phone from scratches and improve grip. The retail box also includes a 10W charger and a Micro-USB cable. A headset is not included, which might disappoint a few users.    The rear panel houses the vertically stacked cameras and a centrally located fingerprint sensor. Honor has tried to replicate the color gradient used on its pricier glass-backed offerings such as the Honor 10 (Review), but hasn't succeeded fully. The black and blue gradient on the back of our review unit looked a little garish to us. The left of the smartphone houses the SIM tray, which has two Nano-SIM slots and a dedicated microSD card slot. The right side is home to the power button and volume rocker, both of which are small but tactile. On the bottom of the phone is a Micro-USB port, flanked by the primary microphone and a speaker that is loud but tinny. The secondary microphone and 3.5mm headphone jack are placed on the top.

2281,21,honor-8x-review-india-price-1936268,8,10,2018-10-23,1936268,Ankit Chawla,Honor 8X Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/honor-8x-review-india-price-1936268," Honor, Huawei's ambitious smartphone sub-brand, has had an aggressive strategy for India in the past few months, going all out by releasing multiple models priced between Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 35,000 in quick succession. The new Honor 8X is aimed at the competitive Rs. 15,000 price segment, where the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review) has been quite popular for quite some time. But that's not the only smartphone that the Honor 8X is up against. There are other great options such as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review), Nokia 6.1 Plus (Review), Motorola One Power (Review), and the Realme 2 Pro (Review). So, does Honor's latest launch deliver enough performance and featuers to take on the might of these heavy hitters, all of which have received positive reviews from us? We put the Honor 8X to the test.    One of the marquee features of the Honor 8X is its design, something that differentiates it from the others in its price segment. It boasts of a glossy dual-tone design that makes the glass back look and feel premium, especially for a phone that starts at just Rs. 14,999. Honor calls this a “visual grating effect” and says it has used multiple layers of glass to achieve it. However, the glossy back on the Honor 8X is extremely prone to smudges and even scratches. Putting a case on this phone — fortunately a soft TPU one is bundled in the box — is the only way to safeguard the beautiful design. Another highlight of the Honor 8X is its impressive 91 percent screen-to-body ratio with a much smaller bottom chin compared to previously launched Honor phones such as the Honor Play and Honor 9N. There is a 19.5:9 screen on the front, with a small notch on top, and minimal borders all around. Ditching the Honor logo on the front is another change that we welcomed. The phone sports a 6.5-inch display, but has roughly the same dimensions as an iPhone 8 Plus. It is definitely not made for comfortable one-handed usage, and we ended up using both hands for most functions. Still, this phone is relatively slim at about 7.8mm. The Honor 8X is available in three colour options in India — a classic black, a trademark blue, and a bold red. We tried out the blue option which was a looker. It reflects light when you turn it in your hand. The black option is for users who like to keep it sober, while the red finish would be for those who really want to stand out. The Honor 8X has a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor at the back   The Honor 8X has a vertically stacked pair of rear cameras with individual bumps rather than a module encasing both. There is also a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The Honor and “AI Camera” logos are aligned in landscape mode to emphasise that the Honor 8X was designed to show off its camera capabilities. The power and volume buttons are located on the right of the device and are decently large. The left of the phone only houses the SIM tray. This tray can take two Nano SIM cards as well as a microSD card at the same time. Then, you get a Micro-USB port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, the loudspeaker, and the primary microphone on the bottom. A USB Type-C port would have been preferable, but Honor India says cost constraints led it to choose between a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack, so it went with the latter. On top is the secondary microphone that helps in cancelling out external noise during calls. The build quality is decent, however, we noticed a couple of scratches on the glass back panel within a few hours of regular usage. Considering there is no reinforced glass for protection at the back, a case is definitely recommended. One aspect of the Honor 8X that is not very pleasant is the size of the earpiece. In an attempt to make the notch as small as possible, Honor has compromised with a tiny earpiece that makes listening to calls frustrating. A slight shift of the phone against your ear can completely block sound during calls. The Honor 8X is the sub-brand's first smartphone in India with a HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC, though we first saw it in the Huawei Nova 3i (Review). It's refreshing to see a mid-range Honor phone powered by something other than the over-used Kirin 659. This 12nm processor has four Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.2GHz and four Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. It takes on the likes of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 636 and Snapdragon 660, both of which are currently popular in this price range The review unit we tested was the base variant with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, priced at Rs. 14,999. There are two other options — 6GB RAM/ 64GB storage (for Rs. 16,999), and 6GB RAM/ 128GB storage (for Rs. 18,999). The Honor 8X had no problems in handling moderate multitasking, and storage was enough for a few dozen apps and lots of photos. The Honor 8X supports additional storage of up to 400GB using a microSD card. The massive 6.5-inch screen has a resolution of 1080x2340 pixels, which should be crisp and clear enough for most people. Honor touts that the display has a blue light filter called Eye Comfort Mode that been certified by TUV Rheinland, a technical advisory firm, making it easy on the eyes. Honor has gone with a 3,750mAh battery under the hood, which supports 5V/2A (10W) charging. There is a dual camera setup at the back with a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. For selfies, a 16-megapixel fixed-focus camera is placed in the notch at the front. The Honor 8X supports 4G VoLTE on both SIMs. You get an ambient light sensor, an electronic compass, a gravity sensor, a gyroscope, a proximity sensor, and a fingerprint sensor. Connectivity options include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2 LE, FM radio, GPS/A-GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou. The unit we tested was running EMUI 8.2.0 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo. An Android Pie update is coming to the Honor 8X, but the company has not announced any official timelines. The phone was running the September 2018 security patch when we got it, which is a good thing. There are quite a few customisations available with EMUI, and the amount of bloatware has reduced drastically, as we noted in our Honor Play review as well. You get just a few preloaded apps such as Facebook Messenger, Netflix, Camera360, and a freemium game called Lords Mobile.    The icons look too large, and a more minimal approach would have been appreciated. There's a Phone Manager app that helps you free RAM, block certain apps, track mobile data usage, check for viruses, and keep a check on battery drain. For the power user, this app is a neat way to keep track of the phone's vitals. The Themes app adds a new Indian theme that we didn't like the look of at all. We preferred the default theme; and there are three others to choose from. Gestures on EMUI were our choice of navigation on the Honor 8X given its humongous display and lack of reachability. You can swipe up from the bottom centre to go back to the home screen, swipe up and hold to reveal the app switcher, or swipe up from the bottom left or bottom right to trigger Google Assistant. You can also swipe left or right in any app to go back to the previous screen. Honor's EMUI has its own dialler, calendar, gallery, music, video, and email apps. You can also mask the notch from within the Settings app. The Honor 8X comes with software-based face recognition. It registers your face in a jiffy, but isn't very secure compared to the 3D sensors that some high-end smartphones have. The Honor 8X was mostly accurate in recognising our registered faces, and was quick to unlock itself. Interestingly, it offered good results in low light and at night. The screen brightness automatically increases to help recognise faces. To compliment face recognition, the Honor 8X also has a snappy rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The responsiveness and fluidity of Honor's EMUI has improved a lot over the past couple of years. The Honor 8X is a great example of that; it offered a largely lag-free experience and had no issues while multitasking with several apps at a time. The phone did, however, experience some stutter particularly while using Facebook Messenger. Switching between apps was smooth, but the Recent Apps gesture could do with some improvement in terms of fluidity. Call quality was top notch with the Honor 8X with decent reception even in areas with low cellular signals. As for gaming, this is one of several recent Honor smartphones to feature the GPU Turbo technology out of the box. GPU Turbo is a gaming-focused optimisation that claims to offer a 60 percent improvement in performance and 30 percent better battery life when playing games. We tried heavy games such as Asphalt 9: Legends and PUBG, but the latter ran well only at moderate settings. Lighter games such as Subway Surfers and Candy Crush were a breeze to use. Heating was minimal, and battery drain was reasonable during our scattered gaming sessions. In terms of benchmarks, the Honor 8X scored an impressive 140,435 in AnTuTu; 1,604 and 5,559 respectively in Geekbench's single- and multi-core tests; and 7,176 in PCMark's Work 2.0 test. These are better scores than what we have seen from Snapdragon 636-powered phones such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1, and even Snapdragon 660-powered devices such as the Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review) and Realme 2 Pro. As for graphics benchmarks, the Honor 8X's GPU managed 35fps in GFXBench's T-Rex test and 13fps in the Manhattan 3.1 test. These scores are equal to or lower than what those same phones managed, showing that the Kirin 710's graphics performance isn't as strong as its general CPU performance. Honor's camera app has a straightforward interface. It highlights five major modes — Aperture, Night, Portrait, Photo, and Video. Other options like Pro, Slow-mo, Panorama, AR Lens, HDR, Time-lapse, and more are stashed under the “More” section. The app has an AI Photography option, much like other recent Honor phones, which can be turned off. Tap to see full-sized Honor 8X sample photos   An interesting addition is the ability to toggle AI mode even after a shot has been captured. This was actually helpful considering that some of the shots we took using AI mode came out overexposed with extreme contrast. The rear camera setup consists of a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor, both with f/1.8 apertures. It supports slow-motion video recording at 480fps slowed up to 1/16th the normal speed. Given its price point, the Honor 8X's photo quality is nothing to write home about. Autofocus with the rear camera is quick and mostly accurate in good lighting, but the resulting photos lack clarity. Night shots look passable on the phone itself, but a lack of detail is clearly visible when seen at full size. The advertised AI camera mode is almost unusable in low light as it only ends up making shots look oversaturated by blowing out bright colours. The 16-megapixel selfie camera is much better in terms of sharpness in picture quality, and delivers good image definition in well-lit areas. Night shots are below average on the front camera too, and the screen flash does little to help. The Honor 8X supports up to 1080p video recording at 60fps, but has 720p set as the default. The lack of any form of stabilisation is evident considering how shaky videos turn out. Beautification works for both cameras but the results appear extremely artificial. The front camera gets a screen flash for low light selfies, which helps in the dark. . We were initially skeptical about how the battery life might turn out given the Honor 8X's massive 6.5-inch full-HD+ display. However, results were impressive, and the phone lasted the entire day on a single full charge. Our usage included browsing social media apps and checking emails all day, as well as streaming a couple of YouTube videos and a 15-minute gaming session, using both 4G and Wi-Fi networks. The Honor 8X also lasted 14 hours and 47 minutes in our proprietary HD video loop test. It charged up from 0 to 100 percent in slightly more than 2 hours with its bundled 10W charger. Honor 8X in pictures   VerdictHonor is making an attempt to penetrate the market with a good-looking and relatively affordable phablet that offers good value for money. Not only does this phone look good, it performs great for its price thanks to the new HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC. Other things that work for the Honor 8X include its looks, vibrant display, and fast biometric security features. However, the camera results are below average, the UI could have looked sharper, and faster charging would have been useful. Xiaomi's Redmi Note 5 Pro and Asus' ZenFone Max Pro M1 have been in the market for around six months now, and are being challenged by newer options including the Nokia 6.1 Plus and Motorola One Power. The Honor 8X could also be a tempting choice for a lot of people."

There is a 19.5:9 screen on the front, with a small notch on top, and minimal borders all around. Ditching the Honor logo on the front is another change that we welcomed. The phone sports a 6.5-inch display, but has roughly the same dimensions as an iPhone 8 Plus. It is definitely not made for comfortable one-handed usage, and we ended up using both hands for most functions. Still, this phone is relatively slim at about 7.8mm. The Honor 8X is available in three colour options in India — a classic black, a trademark blue, and a bold red. We tried out the blue option which was a looker. It reflects light when you turn it in your hand. The black option is for users who like to keep it sober, while the red finish would be for those who really want to stand out. The Honor 8X has a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor at the back   The Honor 8X has a vertically stacked pair of rear cameras with individual bumps rather than a module encasing both. There is also a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The Honor and “AI Camera” logos are aligned in landscape mode to emphasise that the Honor 8X was designed to show off its camera capabilities. The power and volume buttons are located on the right of the device and are decently large. The left of the phone only houses the SIM tray. This tray can take two Nano SIM cards as well as a microSD card at the same time. Then, you get a Micro-USB port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, the loudspeaker, and the primary microphone on the bottom. A USB Type-C port would have been preferable, but Honor India says cost constraints led it to choose between a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack, so it went with the latter. On top is the secondary microphone that helps in cancelling out external noise during calls. The build quality is decent, however, we noticed a couple of scratches on the glass back panel within a few hours of regular usage. Considering there is no reinforced glass for protection at the back, a case is definitely recommended. One aspect of the Honor 8X that is not very pleasant is the size of the earpiece. In an attempt to make the notch as small as possible, Honor has compromised with a tiny earpiece that makes listening to calls frustrating. A slight shift of the phone against your ear can completely block sound during calls. The Honor 8X is the sub-brand's first smartphone in India with a HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC, though we first saw it in the Huawei Nova 3i (Review). It's refreshing to see a mid-range Honor phone powered by something other than the over-used Kirin 659. This 12nm processor has four Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.2GHz and four Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. It takes on the likes of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 636 and Snapdragon 660, both of which are currently popular in this price range The review unit we tested was the base variant with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, priced at Rs. 14,999. There are two other options — 6GB RAM/ 64GB storage (for Rs. 16,999), and 6GB RAM/ 128GB storage (for Rs. 18,999). The Honor 8X had no problems in handling moderate multitasking, and storage was enough for a few dozen apps and lots of photos. The Honor 8X supports additional storage of up to 400GB using a microSD card. The massive 6.5-inch screen has a resolution of 1080x2340 pixels, which should be crisp and clear enough for most people. Honor touts that the display has a blue light filter called Eye Comfort Mode that been certified by TUV Rheinland, a technical advisory firm, making it easy on the eyes. Honor has gone with a 3,750mAh battery under the hood, which supports 5V/2A (10W) charging. There is a dual camera setup at the back with a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. For selfies, a 16-megapixel fixed-focus camera is placed in the notch at the front. The Honor 8X supports 4G VoLTE on both SIMs. You get an ambient light sensor, an electronic compass, a gravity sensor, a gyroscope, a proximity sensor, and a fingerprint sensor. Connectivity options include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2 LE, FM radio, GPS/A-GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou. The unit we tested was running EMUI 8.2.0 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo. An Android Pie update is coming to the Honor 8X, but the company has not announced any official timelines. The phone was running the September 2018 security patch when we got it, which is a good thing. There are quite a few customisations available with EMUI, and the amount of bloatware has reduced drastically, as we noted in our Honor Play review as well. You get just a few preloaded apps such as Facebook Messenger, Netflix, Camera360, and a freemium game called Lords Mobile.    The icons look too large, and a more minimal approach would have been appreciated. There's a Phone Manager app that helps you free RAM, block certain apps, track mobile data usage, check for viruses, and keep a check on battery drain. For the power user, this app is a neat way to keep track of the phone's vitals. The Themes app adds a new Indian theme that we didn't like the look of at all. We preferred the default theme; and there are three others to choose from. Gestures on EMUI were our choice of navigation on the Honor 8X given its humongous display and lack of reachability. You can swipe up from the bottom centre to go back to the home screen, swipe up and hold to reveal the app switcher, or swipe up from the bottom left or bottom right to trigger Google Assistant. You can also swipe left or right in any app to go back to the previous screen. Honor's EMUI has its own dialler, calendar, gallery, music, video, and email apps. You can also mask the notch from within the Settings app. The Honor 8X comes with software-based face recognition. It registers your face in a jiffy, but isn't very secure compared to the 3D sensors that some high-end smartphones have. The Honor 8X was mostly accurate in recognising our registered faces, and was quick to unlock itself. Interestingly, it offered good results in low light and at night. The screen brightness automatically increases to help recognise faces. To compliment face recognition, the Honor 8X also has a snappy rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The responsiveness and fluidity of Honor's EMUI has improved a lot over the past couple of years. The Honor 8X is a great example of that; it offered a largely lag-free experience and had no issues while multitasking with several apps at a time. The phone did, however, experience some stutter particularly while using Facebook Messenger. Switching between apps was smooth, but the Recent Apps gesture could do with some improvement in terms of fluidity. Call quality was top notch with the Honor 8X with decent reception even in areas with low cellular signals. As for gaming, this is one of several recent Honor smartphones to feature the GPU Turbo technology out of the box. GPU Turbo is a gaming-focused optimisation that claims to offer a 60 percent improvement in performance and 30 percent better battery life when playing games. We tried heavy games such as Asphalt 9: Legends and PUBG, but the latter ran well only at moderate settings. Lighter games such as Subway Surfers and Candy Crush were a breeze to use. Heating was minimal, and battery drain was reasonable during our scattered gaming sessions. In terms of benchmarks, the Honor 8X scored an impressive 140,435 in AnTuTu; 1,604 and 5,559 respectively in Geekbench's single- and multi-core tests; and 7,176 in PCMark's Work 2.0 test. These are better scores than what we have seen from Snapdragon 636-powered phones such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1, and even Snapdragon 660-powered devices such as the Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review) and Realme 2 Pro. As for graphics benchmarks, the Honor 8X's GPU managed 35fps in GFXBench's T-Rex test and 13fps in the Manhattan 3.1 test. These scores are equal to or lower than what those same phones managed, showing that the Kirin 710's graphics performance isn't as strong as its general CPU performance. Honor's camera app has a straightforward interface. It highlights five major modes — Aperture, Night, Portrait, Photo, and Video. Other options like Pro, Slow-mo, Panorama, AR Lens, HDR, Time-lapse, and more are stashed under the “More” section. The app has an AI Photography option, much like other recent Honor phones, which can be turned off. Tap to see full-sized Honor 8X sample photos   An interesting addition is the ability to toggle AI mode even after a shot has been captured. This was actually helpful considering that some of the shots we took using AI mode came out overexposed with extreme contrast. The rear camera setup consists of a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor, both with f/1.8 apertures. It supports slow-motion video recording at 480fps slowed up to 1/16th the normal speed. Given its price point, the Honor 8X's photo quality is nothing to write home about. Autofocus with the rear camera is quick and mostly accurate in good lighting, but the resulting photos lack clarity. Night shots look passable on the phone itself, but a lack of detail is clearly visible when seen at full size. The advertised AI camera mode is almost unusable in low light as it only ends up making shots look oversaturated by blowing out bright colours. The 16-megapixel selfie camera is much better in terms of sharpness in picture quality, and delivers good image definition in well-lit areas. Night shots are below average on the front camera too, and the screen flash does little to help. The Honor 8X supports up to 1080p video recording at 60fps, but has 720p set as the default. The lack of any form of stabilisation is evident considering how shaky videos turn out. Beautification works for both cameras but the results appear extremely artificial. The front camera gets a screen flash for low light selfies, which helps in the dark. . We were initially skeptical about how the battery life might turn out given the Honor 8X's massive 6.5-inch full-HD+ display. However, results were impressive, and the phone lasted the entire day on a single full charge. Our usage included browsing social media apps and checking emails all day, as well as streaming a couple of YouTube videos and a 15-minute gaming session, using both 4G and Wi-Fi networks. The Honor 8X also lasted 14 hours and 47 minutes in our proprietary HD video loop test. It charged up from 0 to 100 percent in slightly more than 2 hours with its bundled 10W charger. Honor 8X in pictures   VerdictHonor is making an attempt to penetrate the market with a good-looking and relatively affordable phablet that offers good value for money. Not only does this phone look good, it performs great for its price thanks to the new HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC. Other things that work for the Honor 8X include its looks, vibrant display, and fast biometric security features. However, the camera results are below average, the UI could have looked sharper, and faster charging would have been useful. Xiaomi's Redmi Note 5 Pro and Asus' ZenFone Max Pro M1 have been in the market for around six months now, and are being challenged by newer options including the Nokia 6.1 Plus and Motorola One Power. The Honor 8X could also be a tempting choice for a lot of people."
2281,21,honor-8x-review-india-price-1936268,8,10,2018-10-23,1936268,Ankit Chawla,Honor 8X Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/honor-8x-review-india-price-1936268," Honor, Huawei's ambitious smartphone sub-brand, has had an aggressive strategy for India in the past few months, going all out by releasing multiple models priced between Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 35,000 in quick succession. The new Honor 8X is aimed at the competitive Rs. 15,000 price segment, where the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review) has been quite popular for quite some time. But that's not the only smartphone that the Honor 8X is up against. There are other great options such as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review), Nokia 6.1 Plus (Review), Motorola One Power (Review), and the Realme 2 Pro (Review). So, does Honor's latest launch deliver enough performance and featuers to take on the might of these heavy hitters, all of which have received positive reviews from us? We put the Honor 8X to the test.    One of the marquee features of the Honor 8X is its design, something that differentiates it from the others in its price segment. It boasts of a glossy dual-tone design that makes the glass back look and feel premium, especially for a phone that starts at just Rs. 14,999. Honor calls this a “visual grating effect” and says it has used multiple layers of glass to achieve it. However, the glossy back on the Honor 8X is extremely prone to smudges and even scratches. Putting a case on this phone — fortunately a soft TPU one is bundled in the box — is the only way to safeguard the beautiful design. Another highlight of the Honor 8X is its impressive 91 percent screen-to-body ratio with a much smaller bottom chin compared to previously launched Honor phones such as the Honor Play and Honor 9N.

You can swipe up from the bottom centre to go back to the home screen, swipe up and hold to reveal the app switcher, or swipe up from the bottom left or bottom right to trigger Google Assistant. You can also swipe left or right in any app to go back to the previous screen. Honor's EMUI has its own dialler, calendar, gallery, music, video, and email apps. You can also mask the notch from within the Settings app. The Honor 8X comes with software-based face recognition. It registers your face in a jiffy, but isn't very secure compared to the 3D sensors that some high-end smartphones have. The Honor 8X was mostly accurate in recognising our registered faces, and was quick to unlock itself. Interestingly, it offered good results in low light and at night. The screen brightness automatically increases to help recognise faces. To compliment face recognition, the Honor 8X also has a snappy rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The responsiveness and fluidity of Honor's EMUI has improved a lot over the past couple of years. The Honor 8X is a great example of that; it offered a largely lag-free experience and had no issues while multitasking with several apps at a time. The phone did, however, experience some stutter particularly while using Facebook Messenger. Switching between apps was smooth, but the Recent Apps gesture could do with some improvement in terms of fluidity. Call quality was top notch with the Honor 8X with decent reception even in areas with low cellular signals. As for gaming, this is one of several recent Honor smartphones to feature the GPU Turbo technology out of the box. GPU Turbo is a gaming-focused optimisation that claims to offer a 60 percent improvement in performance and 30 percent better battery life when playing games. We tried heavy games such as Asphalt 9: Legends and PUBG, but the latter ran well only at moderate settings. Lighter games such as Subway Surfers and Candy Crush were a breeze to use. Heating was minimal, and battery drain was reasonable during our scattered gaming sessions. In terms of benchmarks, the Honor 8X scored an impressive 140,435 in AnTuTu; 1,604 and 5,559 respectively in Geekbench's single- and multi-core tests; and 7,176 in PCMark's Work 2.0 test. These are better scores than what we have seen from Snapdragon 636-powered phones such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1, and even Snapdragon 660-powered devices such as the Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review) and Realme 2 Pro. As for graphics benchmarks, the Honor 8X's GPU managed 35fps in GFXBench's T-Rex test and 13fps in the Manhattan 3.1 test. These scores are equal to or lower than what those same phones managed, showing that the Kirin 710's graphics performance isn't as strong as its general CPU performance. Honor's camera app has a straightforward interface. It highlights five major modes — Aperture, Night, Portrait, Photo, and Video. Other options like Pro, Slow-mo, Panorama, AR Lens, HDR, Time-lapse, and more are stashed under the “More” section. The app has an AI Photography option, much like other recent Honor phones, which can be turned off. Tap to see full-sized Honor 8X sample photos   An interesting addition is the ability to toggle AI mode even after a shot has been captured. This was actually helpful considering that some of the shots we took using AI mode came out overexposed with extreme contrast. The rear camera setup consists of a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor, both with f/1.8 apertures. It supports slow-motion video recording at 480fps slowed up to 1/16th the normal speed. Given its price point, the Honor 8X's photo quality is nothing to write home about. Autofocus with the rear camera is quick and mostly accurate in good lighting, but the resulting photos lack clarity. Night shots look passable on the phone itself, but a lack of detail is clearly visible when seen at full size. The advertised AI camera mode is almost unusable in low light as it only ends up making shots look oversaturated by blowing out bright colours. The 16-megapixel selfie camera is much better in terms of sharpness in picture quality, and delivers good image definition in well-lit areas. Night shots are below average on the front camera too, and the screen flash does little to help. The Honor 8X supports up to 1080p video recording at 60fps, but has 720p set as the default. The lack of any form of stabilisation is evident considering how shaky videos turn out. Beautification works for both cameras but the results appear extremely artificial. The front camera gets a screen flash for low light selfies, which helps in the dark. . We were initially skeptical about how the battery life might turn out given the Honor 8X's massive 6.5-inch full-HD+ display. However, results were impressive, and the phone lasted the entire day on a single full charge. Our usage included browsing social media apps and checking emails all day, as well as streaming a couple of YouTube videos and a 15-minute gaming session, using both 4G and Wi-Fi networks. The Honor 8X also lasted 14 hours and 47 minutes in our proprietary HD video loop test. It charged up from 0 to 100 percent in slightly more than 2 hours with its bundled 10W charger. Honor 8X in pictures   VerdictHonor is making an attempt to penetrate the market with a good-looking and relatively affordable phablet that offers good value for money. Not only does this phone look good, it performs great for its price thanks to the new HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC. Other things that work for the Honor 8X include its looks, vibrant display, and fast biometric security features. However, the camera results are below average, the UI could have looked sharper, and faster charging would have been useful. Xiaomi's Redmi Note 5 Pro and Asus' ZenFone Max Pro M1 have been in the market for around six months now, and are being challenged by newer options including the Nokia 6.1 Plus and Motorola One Power. The Honor 8X could also be a tempting choice for a lot of people."
2281,21,honor-8x-review-india-price-1936268,8,10,2018-10-23,1936268,Ankit Chawla,Honor 8X Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/honor-8x-review-india-price-1936268," Honor, Huawei's ambitious smartphone sub-brand, has had an aggressive strategy for India in the past few months, going all out by releasing multiple models priced between Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 35,000 in quick succession. The new Honor 8X is aimed at the competitive Rs. 15,000 price segment, where the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review) has been quite popular for quite some time. But that's not the only smartphone that the Honor 8X is up against. There are other great options such as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review), Nokia 6.1 Plus (Review), Motorola One Power (Review), and the Realme 2 Pro (Review). So, does Honor's latest launch deliver enough performance and featuers to take on the might of these heavy hitters, all of which have received positive reviews from us? We put the Honor 8X to the test.    One of the marquee features of the Honor 8X is its design, something that differentiates it from the others in its price segment. It boasts of a glossy dual-tone design that makes the glass back look and feel premium, especially for a phone that starts at just Rs. 14,999. Honor calls this a “visual grating effect” and says it has used multiple layers of glass to achieve it. However, the glossy back on the Honor 8X is extremely prone to smudges and even scratches. Putting a case on this phone — fortunately a soft TPU one is bundled in the box — is the only way to safeguard the beautiful design. Another highlight of the Honor 8X is its impressive 91 percent screen-to-body ratio with a much smaller bottom chin compared to previously launched Honor phones such as the Honor Play and Honor 9N. There is a 19.5:9 screen on the front, with a small notch on top, and minimal borders all around. Ditching the Honor logo on the front is another change that we welcomed. The phone sports a 6.5-inch display, but has roughly the same dimensions as an iPhone 8 Plus. It is definitely not made for comfortable one-handed usage, and we ended up using both hands for most functions. Still, this phone is relatively slim at about 7.8mm. The Honor 8X is available in three colour options in India — a classic black, a trademark blue, and a bold red. We tried out the blue option which was a looker. It reflects light when you turn it in your hand. The black option is for users who like to keep it sober, while the red finish would be for those who really want to stand out. The Honor 8X has a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor at the back   The Honor 8X has a vertically stacked pair of rear cameras with individual bumps rather than a module encasing both. There is also a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The Honor and “AI Camera” logos are aligned in landscape mode to emphasise that the Honor 8X was designed to show off its camera capabilities. The power and volume buttons are located on the right of the device and are decently large. The left of the phone only houses the SIM tray. This tray can take two Nano SIM cards as well as a microSD card at the same time. Then, you get a Micro-USB port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, the loudspeaker, and the primary microphone on the bottom. A USB Type-C port would have been preferable, but Honor India says cost constraints led it to choose between a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack, so it went with the latter. On top is the secondary microphone that helps in cancelling out external noise during calls. The build quality is decent, however, we noticed a couple of scratches on the glass back panel within a few hours of regular usage. Considering there is no reinforced glass for protection at the back, a case is definitely recommended. One aspect of the Honor 8X that is not very pleasant is the size of the earpiece. In an attempt to make the notch as small as possible, Honor has compromised with a tiny earpiece that makes listening to calls frustrating. A slight shift of the phone against your ear can completely block sound during calls. The Honor 8X is the sub-brand's first smartphone in India with a HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC, though we first saw it in the Huawei Nova 3i (Review). It's refreshing to see a mid-range Honor phone powered by something other than the over-used Kirin 659. This 12nm processor has four Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.2GHz and four Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. It takes on the likes of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 636 and Snapdragon 660, both of which are currently popular in this price range The review unit we tested was the base variant with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, priced at Rs. 14,999. There are two other options — 6GB RAM/ 64GB storage (for Rs. 16,999), and 6GB RAM/ 128GB storage (for Rs. 18,999). The Honor 8X had no problems in handling moderate multitasking, and storage was enough for a few dozen apps and lots of photos. The Honor 8X supports additional storage of up to 400GB using a microSD card. The massive 6.5-inch screen has a resolution of 1080x2340 pixels, which should be crisp and clear enough for most people. Honor touts that the display has a blue light filter called Eye Comfort Mode that been certified by TUV Rheinland, a technical advisory firm, making it easy on the eyes. Honor has gone with a 3,750mAh battery under the hood, which supports 5V/2A (10W) charging. There is a dual camera setup at the back with a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. For selfies, a 16-megapixel fixed-focus camera is placed in the notch at the front. The Honor 8X supports 4G VoLTE on both SIMs. You get an ambient light sensor, an electronic compass, a gravity sensor, a gyroscope, a proximity sensor, and a fingerprint sensor. Connectivity options include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2 LE, FM radio, GPS/A-GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou. The unit we tested was running EMUI 8.2.0 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo. An Android Pie update is coming to the Honor 8X, but the company has not announced any official timelines. The phone was running the September 2018 security patch when we got it, which is a good thing. There are quite a few customisations available with EMUI, and the amount of bloatware has reduced drastically, as we noted in our Honor Play review as well. You get just a few preloaded apps such as Facebook Messenger, Netflix, Camera360, and a freemium game called Lords Mobile.    The icons look too large, and a more minimal approach would have been appreciated. There's a Phone Manager app that helps you free RAM, block certain apps, track mobile data usage, check for viruses, and keep a check on battery drain. For the power user, this app is a neat way to keep track of the phone's vitals. The Themes app adds a new Indian theme that we didn't like the look of at all. We preferred the default theme; and there are three others to choose from. Gestures on EMUI were our choice of navigation on the Honor 8X given its humongous display and lack of reachability.

You can also swipe left or right in any app to go back to the previous screen. Honor's EMUI has its own dialler, calendar, gallery, music, video, and email apps.

However, the camera results are below average, the UI could have looked sharper, and faster charging would have been useful. Xiaomi's Redmi Note 5 Pro and Asus' ZenFone Max Pro M1 have been in the market for around six months now, and are being challenged by newer options including the Nokia 6.1 Plus and Motorola One Power. The Honor 8X could also be a tempting choice for a lot of people."
2281,21,honor-8x-review-india-price-1936268,8,10,2018-10-23,1936268,Ankit Chawla,Honor 8X Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/honor-8x-review-india-price-1936268," Honor, Huawei's ambitious smartphone sub-brand, has had an aggressive strategy for India in the past few months, going all out by releasing multiple models priced between Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 35,000 in quick succession. The new Honor 8X is aimed at the competitive Rs. 15,000 price segment, where the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review) has been quite popular for quite some time. But that's not the only smartphone that the Honor 8X is up against. There are other great options such as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review), Nokia 6.1 Plus (Review), Motorola One Power (Review), and the Realme 2 Pro (Review). So, does Honor's latest launch deliver enough performance and featuers to take on the might of these heavy hitters, all of which have received positive reviews from us? We put the Honor 8X to the test.    One of the marquee features of the Honor 8X is its design, something that differentiates it from the others in its price segment. It boasts of a glossy dual-tone design that makes the glass back look and feel premium, especially for a phone that starts at just Rs. 14,999. Honor calls this a “visual grating effect” and says it has used multiple layers of glass to achieve it. However, the glossy back on the Honor 8X is extremely prone to smudges and even scratches. Putting a case on this phone — fortunately a soft TPU one is bundled in the box — is the only way to safeguard the beautiful design. Another highlight of the Honor 8X is its impressive 91 percent screen-to-body ratio with a much smaller bottom chin compared to previously launched Honor phones such as the Honor Play and Honor 9N. There is a 19.5:9 screen on the front, with a small notch on top, and minimal borders all around. Ditching the Honor logo on the front is another change that we welcomed. The phone sports a 6.5-inch display, but has roughly the same dimensions as an iPhone 8 Plus. It is definitely not made for comfortable one-handed usage, and we ended up using both hands for most functions. Still, this phone is relatively slim at about 7.8mm. The Honor 8X is available in three colour options in India — a classic black, a trademark blue, and a bold red. We tried out the blue option which was a looker. It reflects light when you turn it in your hand. The black option is for users who like to keep it sober, while the red finish would be for those who really want to stand out. The Honor 8X has a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor at the back   The Honor 8X has a vertically stacked pair of rear cameras with individual bumps rather than a module encasing both. There is also a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The Honor and “AI Camera” logos are aligned in landscape mode to emphasise that the Honor 8X was designed to show off its camera capabilities. The power and volume buttons are located on the right of the device and are decently large. The left of the phone only houses the SIM tray. This tray can take two Nano SIM cards as well as a microSD card at the same time. Then, you get a Micro-USB port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, the loudspeaker, and the primary microphone on the bottom. A USB Type-C port would have been preferable, but Honor India says cost constraints led it to choose between a USB Type-C port and a 3.5mm headphone jack, so it went with the latter. On top is the secondary microphone that helps in cancelling out external noise during calls. The build quality is decent, however, we noticed a couple of scratches on the glass back panel within a few hours of regular usage. Considering there is no reinforced glass for protection at the back, a case is definitely recommended. One aspect of the Honor 8X that is not very pleasant is the size of the earpiece. In an attempt to make the notch as small as possible, Honor has compromised with a tiny earpiece that makes listening to calls frustrating. A slight shift of the phone against your ear can completely block sound during calls. The Honor 8X is the sub-brand's first smartphone in India with a HiSilicon Kirin 710 SoC, though we first saw it in the Huawei Nova 3i (Review). It's refreshing to see a mid-range Honor phone powered by something other than the over-used Kirin 659. This 12nm processor has four Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 2.2GHz and four Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 1.7GHz. It takes on the likes of Qualcomm's Snapdragon 636 and Snapdragon 660, both of which are currently popular in this price range The review unit we tested was the base variant with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, priced at Rs. 14,999. There are two other options — 6GB RAM/ 64GB storage (for Rs. 16,999), and 6GB RAM/ 128GB storage (for Rs. 18,999). The Honor 8X had no problems in handling moderate multitasking, and storage was enough for a few dozen apps and lots of photos. The Honor 8X supports additional storage of up to 400GB using a microSD card. The massive 6.5-inch screen has a resolution of 1080x2340 pixels, which should be crisp and clear enough for most people. Honor touts that the display has a blue light filter called Eye Comfort Mode that been certified by TUV Rheinland, a technical advisory firm, making it easy on the eyes. Honor has gone with a 3,750mAh battery under the hood, which supports 5V/2A (10W) charging. There is a dual camera setup at the back with a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. For selfies, a 16-megapixel fixed-focus camera is placed in the notch at the front. The Honor 8X supports 4G VoLTE on both SIMs. You get an ambient light sensor, an electronic compass, a gravity sensor, a gyroscope, a proximity sensor, and a fingerprint sensor. Connectivity options include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2 LE, FM radio, GPS/A-GPS, GLONASS, and BeiDou. The unit we tested was running EMUI 8.2.0 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo. An Android Pie update is coming to the Honor 8X, but the company has not announced any official timelines. The phone was running the September 2018 security patch when we got it, which is a good thing. There are quite a few customisations available with EMUI, and the amount of bloatware has reduced drastically, as we noted in our Honor Play review as well. You get just a few preloaded apps such as Facebook Messenger, Netflix, Camera360, and a freemium game called Lords Mobile.    The icons look too large, and a more minimal approach would have been appreciated. There's a Phone Manager app that helps you free RAM, block certain apps, track mobile data usage, check for viruses, and keep a check on battery drain. For the power user, this app is a neat way to keep track of the phone's vitals. The Themes app adds a new Indian theme that we didn't like the look of at all. We preferred the default theme; and there are three others to choose from. Gestures on EMUI were our choice of navigation on the Honor 8X given its humongous display and lack of reachability. You can swipe up from the bottom centre to go back to the home screen, swipe up and hold to reveal the app switcher, or swipe up from the bottom left or bottom right to trigger Google Assistant. You can also swipe left or right in any app to go back to the previous screen. Honor's EMUI has its own dialler, calendar, gallery, music, video, and email apps. You can also mask the notch from within the Settings app. The Honor 8X comes with software-based face recognition. It registers your face in a jiffy, but isn't very secure compared to the 3D sensors that some high-end smartphones have. The Honor 8X was mostly accurate in recognising our registered faces, and was quick to unlock itself. Interestingly, it offered good results in low light and at night. The screen brightness automatically increases to help recognise faces. To compliment face recognition, the Honor 8X also has a snappy rear-mounted fingerprint sensor. The responsiveness and fluidity of Honor's EMUI has improved a lot over the past couple of years. The Honor 8X is a great example of that; it offered a largely lag-free experience and had no issues while multitasking with several apps at a time. The phone did, however, experience some stutter particularly while using Facebook Messenger. Switching between apps was smooth, but the Recent Apps gesture could do with some improvement in terms of fluidity. Call quality was top notch with the Honor 8X with decent reception even in areas with low cellular signals. As for gaming, this is one of several recent Honor smartphones to feature the GPU Turbo technology out of the box. GPU Turbo is a gaming-focused optimisation that claims to offer a 60 percent improvement in performance and 30 percent better battery life when playing games. We tried heavy games such as Asphalt 9: Legends and PUBG, but the latter ran well only at moderate settings. Lighter games such as Subway Surfers and Candy Crush were a breeze to use. Heating was minimal, and battery drain was reasonable during our scattered gaming sessions. In terms of benchmarks, the Honor 8X scored an impressive 140,435 in AnTuTu; 1,604 and 5,559 respectively in Geekbench's single- and multi-core tests; and 7,176 in PCMark's Work 2.0 test. These are better scores than what we have seen from Snapdragon 636-powered phones such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1, and even Snapdragon 660-powered devices such as the Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review) and Realme 2 Pro. As for graphics benchmarks, the Honor 8X's GPU managed 35fps in GFXBench's T-Rex test and 13fps in the Manhattan 3.1 test. These scores are equal to or lower than what those same phones managed, showing that the Kirin 710's graphics performance isn't as strong as its general CPU performance. Honor's camera app has a straightforward interface. It highlights five major modes — Aperture, Night, Portrait, Photo, and Video. Other options like Pro, Slow-mo, Panorama, AR Lens, HDR, Time-lapse, and more are stashed under the “More” section. The app has an AI Photography option, much like other recent Honor phones, which can be turned off. Tap to see full-sized Honor 8X sample photos   An interesting addition is the ability to toggle AI mode even after a shot has been captured. This was actually helpful considering that some of the shots we took using AI mode came out overexposed with extreme contrast. The rear camera setup consists of a 20-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor, both with f/1.8 apertures. It supports slow-motion video recording at 480fps slowed up to 1/16th the normal speed. Given its price point, the Honor 8X's photo quality is nothing to write home about. Autofocus with the rear camera is quick and mostly accurate in good lighting, but the resulting photos lack clarity. Night shots look passable on the phone itself, but a lack of detail is clearly visible when seen at full size. The advertised AI camera mode is almost unusable in low light as it only ends up making shots look oversaturated by blowing out bright colours. The 16-megapixel selfie camera is much better in terms of sharpness in picture quality, and delivers good image definition in well-lit areas. Night shots are below average on the front camera too, and the screen flash does little to help. The Honor 8X supports up to 1080p video recording at 60fps, but has 720p set as the default. The lack of any form of stabilisation is evident considering how shaky videos turn out. Beautification works for both cameras but the results appear extremely artificial. The front camera gets a screen flash for low light selfies, which helps in the dark. . We were initially skeptical about how the battery life might turn out given the Honor 8X's massive 6.5-inch full-HD+ display. However, results were impressive, and the phone lasted the entire day on a single full charge. Our usage included browsing social media apps and checking emails all day, as well as streaming a couple of YouTube videos and a 15-minute gaming session, using both 4G and Wi-Fi networks. The Honor 8X also lasted 14 hours and 47 minutes in our proprietary HD video loop test. It charged up from 0 to 100 percent in slightly more than 2 hours with its bundled 10W charger.

2229,21,honor-9-lite-review-1801773,7,10,2018-01-19,1801773,Roydon Cerejo,Honor 9 Lite Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/honor-9-lite-review-1801773," A good smartphone camera is hard to come by in the budget segment. Here, manufacturers usually try to offer the best processors, RAM and storage because specifications stand out. We've seen some smartphones that claim to be camera-focused, such as Xiaomi’s Redmi Y1 (Review), part of its Y series, which didn't turn out to be great when we reviewed it.  Now, Huawei's Honor brand hopes to do one better with its new Honor 9 Lite - a reasonably priced smartphone that boasts of four cameras. This isn’t the company’s first attempt at a quad-camera smartphone - we first saw it attempt to wow buyers with the Honor 9i (Review). However, the company is now taking this feature a bit more mainstream as the 9 Lite enters the market priced at just Rs. 10,999. The 9 Lite doesn't rely solely on its cameras; it also seems to check all the right boxes in terms of specifications. Our first impressions of it were fairly positive, and it’s now time to see if the Honor 9 Lite can indeed raise the bar in the budget segment.  The Honor 9 Lite reminds us a lot of the Honor 8 (Review), which was the company’s flagship in 2016. The 2.5D curved glass on the back has a mirror effect, which looks really good. However, according to Honor’s website, this effect is limited to the Sapphire Blue and Glacier Gray versions only, and not the Midnight Black one. It's similar to what we’ve seen with the Moto X4 (Review). There glass for the display in front is curved similarly, and thanks to this and the phone's rounded sides, you get a very comfortable grip. The downside to having glass is that it can be incredibly slippery and is most certainly a pain to keep free of smudges. The frame is plastic though, instead of metal, which was probably necessary to keep costs down. This also makes the phone quite light, and it’s sometimes easy to forget you have it in your pocket. We would have liked the SIM tray to have had the same colour and finish as the rest of the body, but unfortunately it sticks out a bit. Other than that, we don't have any complaints with the build quality or finish. The volume and power buttons are plastic but they do have a nice tactile feel. The SIM tray on the left accepts either two Nano-SIMs or one SIM and a microSD card (up to 256GB). The 3.5mm headphone socket and Micro-USB port are on the bottom, along with a speaker grille. Once again, it’s disappointing to see Honor not adopting the newer Type-C standard here. It seems as though Honor is only using it for its higher end offerings.  The display is another aspect of the 9 Lite that we liked very much. It’s a Full-HD+ IPS panel, measuring 5.65 inches diagonally with the newer 18:9 aspect ratio which the industry seems to be embracing with open arms. The taller display paves the way for thinner borders all around, which gives the phone a good aesthetic. There’s just enough room for the front camera above the screen, and a company logo below it. The panel has good brightness and colour reproduction too. The taller display might be hard to reach with your fingers but there are gestures to assist with that such as being able to swipe down on the fingerprint sensor for the notification shade. There's also a navigation dock (like Assistive Touch on iOS), and a one-handed mode. The Honor 9 Lite has a circular fingerprint sensor at the back, which is quick at authentication. In addition to unlocking the screen, you can use your fingerprint to secure apps and create a virtual safe for private files. The sensor can also be used for gestures such as taking a photo, answering a call, snoozing an alarm, and browsing through photos. These gestures aren’t locked to your enrolled fingerprints and work with any finger. In the box, the 9 Lite ships with standard accessories including a charger, data cable, SIM eject tool, and warranty information. There is no headset. Honor hasn’t crippled the 9 Lite in terms of specifications, and it shares many of the same internals as the Honor 7X and the Honor 9i, both of which are priced higher. To start off, we have Huawei’s custom in-house octa-core processor called the Kirin 659. The phone comes in two RAM and storage variants. There’s one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and another (which we have for review) with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The phone uses about 2GB of RAM on average throughout the day, leaving you with about 2GB free (for the 4GB version), which seems like plenty. Other specifications include FM radio, Bluetooth 4.2, single-band Wi-Fi b/g/n, 4G with VoLTE, USB-OTG, an ambient light, sensor, a proximity sensor, an accelerometer, and a gyroscope. What’s interesting is the Honor 9 Lite scored better in benchmarks than the similarly configured 7X (Review) and 9i. AnTuTu and PCMark Work 2.0 returned scores of 67,914 and 5,079 respectively. GFXbench gave us a score of 19fps which is more in line with the others.  Just like Honor’s recently launched flagship, the View 10 (Review), the 9 Lite ships with Android 8 Oreo out-of-the-box. Of course, buyers only get to experience Android 8 through Honor’s custom skin called EMUI 8. Here, you can have a single-layered interface or an app drawer; you can modify the animations when switching homescreens; and swiping right takes you to Google Now. Huawei Share is sort of like Apple’s AirDrop for Huawei devices, and it works in a similar manner. The Wi-Fi+ feature will automatically switch between Wi-Fi and mobile data, depending on which connection is better. When we tried connecting to a freshly rebooted router, we noticed the Wi-Fi+ at work as it tried to evaluate whether our mobile data or Wi-Fi connection was stronger. Eventually, it settled on Wi-Fi once it detected an Internet connection. The Settings app is designed well and even though some of the sub-menus have been moved around, it’s not too difficult to find them. You also have the option to use Huawei’s cloud services for backing up contacts, calendars, Wi-Fi credentials, SMS messages, and call logs (again, similar to Apple’s iCloud), although there’s no mention of how much storage space you get for free. You also can't back up data from third party apps. You get a host of preinstalled trial games, which thankfully can be removed, and some apps which are essentially links Honor’s websites and community forum. Honor’s new build of EMUI based on Android Oreo runs fairly well, but it’s not as snappy as stock Android or even some custom builds such as OnePlus’ OxygenOS. It’s a different take than Google’s Material deign language but it still looks good and is functional. Even with the 4GB RAM version, we did run into brief slow-downs with simple tasks such as digging around the Settings app. However this is not an issue we were able to replicate consistently. The touch response of the display is good, and we didn’t have any issues with call quality. The processor is powerful enough to offer a smooth multitasking experience, and simple games run fine, but heavier titles like Asphalt 8: Airborne run with choppy framerates. However, this phone does get warm pretty easily. For instance, downloading an app from the Play Store and listening to music at the same time caused the upper portion of the Honor 9 Lite to get a bit warm.   Apps running in full-screen mode aren't handled very well. In the Display sub-menu of the Settings app, there’s an auto-generated list of all installed apps that aren’t ‘optimised’ to run in full-screen mode. You can force them to stretch by flipping a toggle. In some apps, you get an option to force them to run full-screen, while others that are optimised do so automatically. In apps from Google and Huawei, the navigation bar often adapts to the colour of the app, but in others like Facebook, you get a black strip at the bottom and there’s no option to auto-hide it. We did notice that some games such as Asphalt 8: Airborne ran full-screen by default but appeared stretched, and there was no option to force them to run at the standard 16:9 aspect ratio. The 9 Lite ships with some redundant apps including Honor’s own music and video players, in addition to Google’s offerings. The music player lets you use audio enhancements like Huawei’s Histen sound effects, which didn’t really seem to improve actual audio performance when we tried it out. The mono speaker gets loud but quality isn’t great. Low frequencies sound flat and there's a tinny overall sonic signature. Video playback is smooth up to 1080p and even our high-resolution test files had no trouble playing smoothly. The default video player has options to resize video to fill the screen, without stretching it. The big feature that Honor is touting is the fact that this phone has four cameras. There are 13-megapixel primary sensors for the front and back of the 9 Lite, with the difference being that only the rear one supports PDAF. Both cameras have additional 2-megapixel sensors for calculating depth and applying bokeh effects when you use the Portrait and Wide Aperture modes in the camera app. Photos taken during the day look good on the phone's display, going by mainstream smartphone standards. Autofocus is quick and details in landscapes are fairly distinct. However, colours are a bit dull, and zooming in to images reveals mild noise in darker portions. In low light, the 9 Lite suffers from the same issues as nearly every mainstream smartphone camera. Focusing is slow, and details are blurry, especially the edges which are over-sharpened quite a bit.   Tap to see full-sized Honor 9 Lite camera samples Wide aperture mode lets you adjust the aperture value (f/0.95 - f/13) before and after shooting a photo, so you can adjust the depth of field. However, the blur effect isn’t always applied accurately and we found that anything below f/2.0 looks like a poor Photoshop job. There is also a Portrait mode, which essentially does the same thing. You can’t adjust the level of blur while or after taking a shot, and there is a bokeh toggle which doesn’t seem to have any actual impact as the bokeh effect is applied regardless of its state. The effect is better as compared to the Wide Aperture mode, but edge detection is still a bit of a hit or miss, and focusing is slower.  There's a beatification option as well. You also get a bunch of shooting modes including Professional and Panorama, as well as filters and HDR. These work decently well and come in handy at times. You can also enable ‘touch capture’ or have the app automatically take a picture when it detects a smile.  Top: Portrait mode with the rear cameras; Bottom: Portrait mode with the front cameras using beautification and screen flash. Tap to see full-sized camera samples. Video recording maxes out at 1080p and the quality of recorded video is strictly average. There’s no option for electronic stabilisation so video is shaky, and low light footage lacks detail. The front camera manages to captures good selfies. The screen flash is quite effective, and coupled with the beauty mode, you can get some pretty usable pictures even in very low light. Video recording maxes out at 1080p for the front camera as well, unless you have the beauty mode enabled, in which case it’s limited to 720p. There are additional gestures such as the ability to use your palm or your voice to capture a selfie. You can either say 'cheese' or have the phone take a shot when you shout at a certain volume level. Portrait mode works well for the front camera too. Battery life was a bit of a concern for us with the Honor 9 Lite, considering that both the 7X and the 9i didn't fare too well in this department, and they had slightly bigger batteries. In our video loop test, the 9 Lite managed 10 hours and 3 minutes of continuous HD video playback, which is not too great. In terms of our real-world experience, we managed to make one full charge last from morning to night by keeping usage light, with some music streaming and a little use of the cameras. On the other hand, we noticed a dip of around five to seven percent in battery life after running Asphalt 8 for only about 10 minutes, which is concerning. There's no fast charging, and the bundled 10W adapter takes you up to around 60 percent in an hour. You also have the option to drop the screen's resolution to HD+ in order to save power. VerdictThe base variant of the Honor 9 Lite is one of the better options currently in the market, with a reasonable starting price of Rs. 11,000, and an 18:9 display. If you're interested, you should note that the 9 Lite overlaps with Honor’s existing offering, the 7X, which lacks the extra cameras but does have a metal body, a larger screen, and a slightly bigger battery. The 4GB RAM version that we reviewed feels a bit too expensive considering it’s not an all-rounder. This phone looks good, but battery life isn’t great and the camera performance isn’t anything to get excited about either. At roughly, Rs. 15,000, you’d be better off with the Xiaomi Mi A1 (Review) or even the Moto G5S Plus (Review). The latter two lack the newer taller screens which are in style, but offer solid performance in nearly every department. If you’re in no hurry then you might want to wait a bit for Xiaomi’s new Redmi 5 Plus which recently launched in China, and should come to India soon at around this price."
2229,21,honor-9-lite-review-1801773,7,10,2018-01-19,1801773,Roydon Cerejo,Honor 9 Lite Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/honor-9-lite-review-1801773," A good smartphone camera is hard to come by in the budget segment. Here, manufacturers usually try to offer the best processors, RAM and storage because specifications stand out. We've seen some smartphones that claim to be camera-focused, such as Xiaomi’s Redmi Y1 (Review), part of its Y series, which didn't turn out to be great when we reviewed it.  Now, Huawei's Honor brand hopes to do one better with its new Honor 9 Lite - a reasonably priced smartphone that boasts of four cameras. This isn’t the company’s first attempt at a quad-camera smartphone - we first saw it attempt to wow buyers with the Honor 9i (Review). However, the company is now taking this feature a bit more mainstream as the 9 Lite enters the market priced at just Rs. 10,999. The 9 Lite doesn't rely solely on its cameras; it also seems to check all the right boxes in terms of specifications. Our first impressions of it were fairly positive, and it’s now time to see if the Honor 9 Lite can indeed raise the bar in the budget segment.  The Honor 9 Lite reminds us a lot of the Honor 8 (Review), which was the company’s flagship in 2016. The 2.5D curved glass on the back has a mirror effect, which looks really good. However, according to Honor’s website, this effect is limited to the Sapphire Blue and Glacier Gray versions only, and not the Midnight Black one. It's similar to what we’ve seen with the Moto X4 (Review). There glass for the display in front is curved similarly, and thanks to this and the phone's rounded sides, you get a very comfortable grip. The downside to having glass is that it can be incredibly slippery and is most certainly a pain to keep free of smudges. The frame is plastic though, instead of metal, which was probably necessary to keep costs down. This also makes the phone quite light, and it’s sometimes easy to forget you have it in your pocket. We would have liked the SIM tray to have had the same colour and finish as the rest of the body, but unfortunately it sticks out a bit. Other than that, we don't have any complaints with the build quality or finish. The volume and power buttons are plastic but they do have a nice tactile feel. The SIM tray on the left accepts either two Nano-SIMs or one SIM and a microSD card (up to 256GB). The 3.5mm headphone socket and Micro-USB port are on the bottom, along with a speaker grille. Once again, it’s disappointing to see Honor not adopting the newer Type-C standard here. It seems as though Honor is only using it for its higher end offerings.  The display is another aspect of the 9 Lite that we liked very much. It’s a Full-HD+ IPS panel, measuring 5.65 inches diagonally with the newer 18:9 aspect ratio which the industry seems to be embracing with open arms. The taller display paves the way for thinner borders all around, which gives the phone a good aesthetic. There’s just enough room for the front camera above the screen, and a company logo below it. The panel has good brightness and colour reproduction too. The taller display might be hard to reach with your fingers but there are gestures to assist with that such as being able to swipe down on the fingerprint sensor for the notification shade. There's also a navigation dock (like Assistive Touch on iOS), and a one-handed mode. The Honor 9 Lite has a circular fingerprint sensor at the back, which is quick at authentication. In addition to unlocking the screen, you can use your fingerprint to secure apps and create a virtual safe for private files. The sensor can also be used for gestures such as taking a photo, answering a call, snoozing an alarm, and browsing through photos. These gestures aren’t locked to your enrolled fingerprints and work with any finger. In the box, the 9 Lite ships with standard accessories including a charger, data cable, SIM eject tool, and warranty information. There is no headset. Honor hasn’t crippled the 9 Lite in terms of specifications, and it shares many of the same internals as the Honor 7X and the Honor 9i, both of which are priced higher. To start off, we have Huawei’s custom in-house octa-core processor called the Kirin 659. The phone comes in two RAM and storage variants. There’s one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and another (which we have for review) with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The phone uses about 2GB of RAM on average throughout the day, leaving you with about 2GB free (for the 4GB version), which seems like plenty. Other specifications include FM radio, Bluetooth 4.2, single-band Wi-Fi b/g/n, 4G with VoLTE, USB-OTG, an ambient light, sensor, a proximity sensor, an accelerometer, and a gyroscope. What’s interesting is the Honor 9 Lite scored better in benchmarks than the similarly configured 7X (Review) and 9i. AnTuTu and PCMark Work 2.0 returned scores of 67,914 and 5,079 respectively. GFXbench gave us a score of 19fps which is more in line with the others.  Just like Honor’s recently launched flagship, the View 10 (Review), the 9 Lite ships with Android 8 Oreo out-of-the-box.

2229,21,honor-9i-review-1761586,8,10,2017-10-12,1761586,Aditya Shenoy,Honor 9i Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/honor-9i-review-1761586," Huawei’s sub-brand Honor has been dishing out some good phones recently. The Honor 8 Pro (Review) which launched earlier this year went head-to-head with the OnePlus 5 (Review) stealing its thunder to some extent. We were impressed with the specs and features it offered for the price. With the market slowly pivoting towards 18:9 displays, Honor has made that move in the form of the Honor 9i. The screen isn’t the only interesting thing about this new phone. It also sports four cameras making it quite unique. While the specifications look good on paper, do they translate into a good real-world experience? We've got the answer.  If you have been tempted by phones with huge displays and thin bezels, the Honor 9i will pique your interest. It packs a huge 5.9-inch display with slim borders all around. Don’t let the screen size put you off, since the 18:9 aspect ratio means that the phone overall is roughly the same size as most current 5.5-inch phones. The big display means that the metal earpiece, sensors, and front cameras have been pushed right to the upper edge. The fingerprint scanner is at the back and you get a clean front face. Pick the phone up, and the curved sides and edges feel comfortable in hand. The Honor 9i feels solid too, thanks to its metal unibody. While the black finish on our review unit looks gorgeous, it is a fingerprint magnet. The phone is also a little slippery if you aren’t careful when holding it. The dual camera module on the back protrudes by a couple of millimeters but has a metal rim surrounding it, which should help prevent scratches. Honor has lined up the LED flash, cameras, and fingerprint scanner down the center of the phone. We found that we needed to stretch our fingers a little to reach the fingerprint scanner and that a slightly lower positioning would have been better.  The Honor 9i has a Micro-USB port for charging and data transfers, with a 3.5mm headphone jack and the loudspeaker on either side. Honor ships the phone with a 10W charger in the box, a pair of earphones, and a plastic case to use the phone with. The first thing to grab your attention on the Honor 9i will be its big display. It sports a 5.9-inch FullView screen with an 18:9 aspect ratio and FHD+ resolution (1080x2160 pixels). Viewing angles are good but we would have liked a little more vividness in the colours. You can change the colour temperature but we couldn’t find a way to boost contrast. The display is bright enough indoors but you might struggle with it when outdoors. There is no mention of any sort of protective glass, but you get a plastic scratch prevention film pre-installed. The next things you'll notice are its four cameras. Honor has used dual camera setups on both sides. The primary rear and front cameras have 16-megapixel camera and 13-megapixel sensors respectively, and both are paired with 2-megapixel secondary sensors which are used to capture depth information and to enable portrait mode. You get a single LED flash at the back and a soft selfie flash on the front.  In terms of hardware, the Honor 9i is powered by a Huawei Kirin 659 SoC, which has eight ARM Cortex-A53 cores - four cores are clocked at 1.7GHz and the other four cores at 2.36GHz. There is 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage which is expandable thanks to the hybrid dual-SIM slot. This is a dual-SIM device with two Nano-SIM slots, but you can swap the second SIM for a microSD card of up to 128GB. Honor has also packed in a 3340mAh battery which is a little bigger than average. Honor has used its tried and tested custom interface called EMUI on the Honor 9i. You get EMUI 5.1 on top of Android Nougat. Huawei uses its own visual style and has rearranged a few options in the Settings app, but it won’t take much time to get used to. There are gestures that simplify taking screenshots and launching apps. Honor calls these knuckle gestures, and they work by knocking on the screen. You can double-knock to take a screenshot or do a two-knuckle tap to start screen recording. You also have the option to launch apps and enter split-screen mode by tracing letters on the screen. We found some of these quite useful during our review period. The FullView display isn’t very convenient for one-handed use, and the top corners are hard to reach. Honor has also integrated a single-hand mode that shrinks the display down to one corner of the screen. You need to swipe across the navigation buttons to enable it. One other issue with the 18:9 display is that all apps aren’t ready for it yet. While you can run these apps with a black bar at the bottom, Honor also gives you the option to scale them to fit the screen. You get a simple prompt to enable this or you can do it in the display settings. There's also quite a bit of bloatware. The Honor 9i has a few custom apps including HiCare - a service support app; HiGame - a gaming app store; plus Hi Honor and Honor Community which are Web shortcuts. EMUI has support for themes which gives you the ability to change the look of the device. The performance of the Honor 9i is in the same range as that of other devices at this price point. The phone managed to clock 60,550 in AnTuTu, and 914 and 3460 in Geekbench 4's single-core and multi-core test respectively. The phone does not heat up when running day-to-day tasks but it does get warm after gaming for a while. You will enjoy playing games and watching movies on the big screen. We played Real Racing 3, Prime Peaks, and Clash Royale to test how the Honor 9i fares. While Real Racing 3 and Prime Peaks functioned normally, Clash Royale ran zoomed in, resulting in the sides getting cropped. We couldn’t find a way to run the game letterboxed to 16:9 and had to get used to it. We also observed a higher rate of battery drain when gaming so you might want to keep an eye on the charge level. When you aren’t running processor-intensive tasks the phone manages power quite well. With light to medium use the Honor 9i lasted us one working day, but playing games and watching videos has a significant impact on battery life. In our HD video loop test, the phone lasted for 8 hours and 54 minutes which isn’t great compared to other smartphones. You can use the power saver mode which aggressively shuts down background processes and cuts off background syncing, but there is no support for fast charging, which is disappointing.  The biggest feature for the Honor 9i is its cameras. Launch the camera app and you get a simple interface with the photo/ video selector on one side and quick toggles on the other. You get controls for the flash, aperture mode, moving picture mode, and portrait mode. Moving pictures are similar to live photos on iOS, where a short clip is captured along with a still frame. You can swipe right from the default screen to access the different shooting modes. Apart from HDR, panorama, and video, you get pro modes for both photos and videos, slow-mo, filters, effects and a few others. You also have the option to download more modes if you wish to. Pro mode lets you adjust different parameters like ISO, shutter speed, exposure, focus and white balance. You also have the option to shoot in RAW. The default auto mode for photos is good enough and sets the cameras up well. The 16-megapixel primary rear camera captures decent amount of detail in landscapes and macros. The secondary 2-megapixel camera does help separate the subject and background to some extent in portrait and wide aperture modes, but it is mostly software doing the blurring which is evident in a few shots. Selfies have the bokeh effect as well, and we found that the front cameras did a slightly better job compared to the rear ones. You get beautification mode as well, which smoothens skin. Low-light camera performance is average. The Honor 9i manages to keep noise under control but oversharpens photos causing them to lose out on detail. Low-light selfies turn out better thanks to the diffused selfie flash. The Honor 9i can record video at 1080p, both in front and at the back. You can also use beautification when recording video with the front camera, but then the output is restricted to 720p.  We can see that manufacturers are moving towards the 18:9 aspect ratio and this feature isn't restricted to expensive flagships anymore. With the Honor 9i, buyers have one more option for an affordable yet futuristic-looking phone. The Honor 9i strikes a balance between cost and features. You get a fingerprint scanner that was missing on the LG Q6 (Review) and a 1080p display compared to the 720p panel on the Vivo V7+ (Review). The processor is good enough for most people's daily grinds, and the software is easy to use. However, this phone still needed a few improvements when it comes to the cameras and battery performance. If you prioritise looks over performance then the Honor 9i does offer more bang for the buck than other smartphones. On the other hand, if you want a steady all-rounder instead, the Xiaomi Mi A1 (Review) and the Moto G5S Plus (Review) are good alternatives. Honor 9i in pictures"
2229,21,honor-9n-review-1890680,7,10,2018-07-27,1890680,Shobhit Varma,Honor 9N Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/honor-9n-review-1890680," Honor has added yet another budget smartphone to its lineup. The Honor 9N improves upon last year's Honor 9 Lite (Review) in small yet significant ways. The display now sports a notch and the selfie camera has been bumped up to 16 megapixels. It features a glass back, dual rear cameras, a 19:9 display, and runs Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box. The Honor 9N is priced starting at Rs. 11,999 and competes head-on with the likes of the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review), Oppo Realme 1 (Review), and Moto G6 (Review). Does Honor's new smartphone have what it takes to compete in the cut-throat budget segment? Let's find out.    The most striking aspect of the Honor 9N is its design. The back panel is made of glass and has a glossy finish that looks striking. The horizontal dual camera setup barely protrudes from the chassis and the back panel looks very clean thanks to the lack of antenna lines and regulatory information. The 5.84-inch display has a notch at the top, which is quite small. The notch is undoubtedly a polarising design element, and Honor has added an option in the settings menu to mask the same. This basically darkens the screen area on either side of the notch. The Honor 9N will be available in four colour variants - Lavender Purple; Black; Robin Egg Blue, which is a greenish-blue shade that looks fantastic; and the one our review unit came in, Sapphire Blue. Only the Blue and Black versions will be available initially, with the other two coming at a later date.    The smartphone is compact and petite and very easy to use with one hand. The rounded corners and curved sides also enhance in-hand feel. That said, it is incredibly slippery and the glossy glass back is a fingerprint magnet. Build quality though is top-notch. The phone feels solid in the hand and it survived multiple drops during our review period. The rear mounted fingerprint sensor is quick and accurate and can be used for a variety of functions such as taking a picture, answering calls, and sliding down the notification panel. These gestures can be used with any finger and are not locked to the finger you've registered for authentication. The left of the Honor 9N is blank save for the SIM tray which makes you choose between a second Nano-SIM and a microSD card. The right side has the volume rocker and power button which are a tad too small for our liking but well within reach. On the bottom of the phone is a Micro-USB port, flanked by a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a single loud speaker that is shrill and tinny. The lack of a USB Type-C port for charging and data transfers is quite disappointing. The industry has started transitioning towards USB Type-C and it is high time Honor starts adopting the same for its budget offerings as well. The Honor 9N is powered by Honor's tried and trusted Kirin 659 processor which is also found in the likes of the Honor 7X (Review), Honor 9 Lite (Review), and Honor 9i (Review). The smartphone straddles multiple price categories with three variants on offer. The base variant retails for Rs. 11,999 and has 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and the one we tested here is priced at Rs. 13,999 and has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. There is another variant of the smartphone on offer which is priced at Rs. 17,999 and features 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. While the 4 + 64GB variant is set to go on sale on 31st July, the release date of the other two has not been specified by Honor yet.    The Honor 9N has a non-removable 3,000mAh battery and runs EMUI 8.0 on top of Android 8.0 Oreo. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, GLONASS, 4G VoLTE, a Micro-USB port (USB 2.0 speed), and a 3.5mm headphone jack. NFC is not supported. It supports dual SIMs but only one can be connected to a 4G network at a time. The Honor 9N has a 5.84-inch full-HD+ IPS display with an 19:9 aspect ratio. The screen dominates much of the front fascia but is not exactly borderless. The chin is pretty significant. The display is one of the highlights of the smartphone. Viewing angles are spot on and the panel is bright, vivid, and punchy. The 19:9 aspect ratio also lends itself well to gaming and multimedia consumption and EMUI allows you to stretch third-party applications that do not support the aspect ratio natively. The Kirin 659 processor is getting a bit old in the tooth and cannot compare to Qualcomm's newer mid-range offerings in terms of both power and efficiency. The Honor 9N handles basic day-to-day tasks like browsing the Web and using social media applications with ease but struggles when pushed. With multiple applications open in the background or more than a dozen tabs open in Chrome, we could feel the effects of the relatively underpowered processor. We also experienced keyboard lags and occasional slowdowns throughout our review period. With budget smartphones becoming more and more powerful, such slowdowns are quite disappointing. In our experience, simple games like Subway Surfers ran fine but we experienced choppy frames with titles like Asphalt 8 every now and then. Benchmark scores were very similar to other Kirin 659 powered smartphones. We got 5061 in PC Mark Work 2.0, 19fps in GFXbench T-Rex, 5.3fps in GFX Bench Manhattan 3.1, and 937 and 3731 in Geekbench's single- and multi- core tests respectively. We tried running AnTuTu multiple times but failed to get a result. The smartphone did get warm when pushed, but not uncomfortably so. Calls were clear and crisp, and 4G connectivity was solid. The Honor 9N also supports face recognition, via the 16-megapixel front camera. It works quite well for the most part and is near instantaneous in good light, but it struggles somewhat in direct sunlight and when lighting is not the best.  Wi-Fi+, pre-installed applications, and the built-in messaging app that filters spam   The Honor 9N runs Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box, with Huawei's EMUI 8.0 custom skin on top. As of now, there is no information regarding the Android P update for this phone. In its past few iterations, EMUI has become much more responsive. In fact, Huawei claims that EMUI 8.0 is 60 per cent faster and 50 per cent smoother than EMUI 5.1. That said, it's still not as snappy as stock Android or even some custom builds such Oxygen OS. EMUI is also loaded with a host of nifty features such as Wi-Fi+, which automatically switches between Wi-Fi and mobile data depending on which connection is stronger. The phone automatically switched over to mobile data at places where the Wi-Fi signal was rather poor, which was pretty convenient. The built-in messaging app has a useful feature that did a good job of recognising and filtering out spam messages. You also get several gestures such as a three-finger swipe to take a screenshot. We found most of these gestures to be rather flaky but your mileage may vary. Facebook Messenger, TrueCaller and Netflix are pre-installed along with six Gameloft game demos. Thankfully, all of them can be uninstalled. There are a host of first-party Honor applications as well, which compete with Google's own and don't seem to add much value. Overall, the amount of bloat on the Honor 9N is quite disappointing. Just like the Honor 9 Lite, battery life is mediocre. In our HD video loop battery test, the Honor 9N lasted just 8 hours and 40 minutes, which is well below the average for this market segment. With moderate use, we found ourselves reaching for the charger by 9-10pm every day. Our usage involved around an hour or two of Google Maps, frequent use of social media applications including WhatsApp, Twitter and Instagram throughout the day, games such as Asphalt 8, and taking a a couple of selfies and photos. The lack of fast charging means the phone takes around two and a half hours to charge fully. On the imaging front, the Honor 9N features a dual rear camera setup with a 13-megapixel primary sensor, and a 2-megapixel secondary sensor alongside an LED flash. On the front, there is a 16-megapixel sensor. The camera app is quite logically laid out and comes with a fully featured Pro mode, which allows you to alter the shutter speed, ISO, exposure, aperture, and white balance. AR stickers are a fun and nifty way to kill time and can be can be used with both the front and rear camera. There are 16 effects and 14 backgrounds on offer and more can be downloaded from Honor's AppGallery.  Tap to see full-sized Honor 9N camera samples   In favourable light, the rear camera takes above average photos. The level of detail is good and colours are quite accurate. Wide aperture mode lets you adjust the aperture value (f/0.95 - f/13) before - and even after - shooting an image. However, images taken in wide aperture mode often ended up looking like a Photoshop job gone wrong. The resultant shots were sub-par, with average edge detection. In low light, the camera performs rather poorly. Photos lack detail and seem over sharpened. A fair bit of noise creeps in as well and focusing is also slow in unfavourable light. The front camera follows much of the same script - it struggles in low light but captures decent photos in favourable light. There's a beauty mode as well which offers 10 levels of beautification and works reasonably well. The front camera can also shoot bokeh shots via software algorithms (as there is no secondary sensor) but these are quite average and the blur effect does not even work half the time. Both the front and rear camera setups support full-HD (1080p) video recording. Videos are lackluster at best and lack detail, especially at night. The lack of electronic image stabilisation means the footage can be shaky at times. Honor 9N in pictures   VerdictThe Honor 9N is a compact smartphone that sports a vibrant display, a fresh and modern design, and Android 8.0 Oreo out of the box. The colour options are also quite funky, especially Robin Egg Blue, which is set to go on sale soon. That said, battery life is mediocre, performance is below average, EMUI seems cluttered, and the cameras falter in low light. If you want a sleek phone with a great display, the base variant of the Honor 9N makes for a good buy. The other variants are a bit too expensive though and are much harder to recommend. If you are shopping in this price segment, the Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review) is hard to beat as an all-rounder and the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review) offers stellar value for money. Oppo's Realme 1 (Review) is also another option worth considering which has a more powerful processor but lacks a fingerprint sensor. Does Honor 9N have what it takes to beat Redmi Note 5 Pro, Realme 1, Zenfone Max Pro M1?

The Honor 9N improves upon last year's Honor 9 Lite (Review) in small yet significant ways. The display now sports a notch and the selfie camera has been bumped up to 16 megapixels.

1832,21,honor-holly-4-review-1781288,7,10,2017-11-29,1781288,Jamshed Avari,Honor Holly 4 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/honor-holly-4-review-1781288," You can get some great phones for Rs. 15,000 today, but if your budget is even just a little less than that, you don't have to compromise much at all. Competition is so stiff right now that manufacturers are pushing out multiple models and variants of those models all priced between Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 15,000, which means you have lots of choices. Amongst our top picks in this range are several very similar models from Xiaomi, Samsung and Lenovo. Honor, Huawei's youth-focused brand, is making a fresh play in this segment with its new Honor Holly 4 and Holly 4 Plus, priced at Rs. 11,999 and Rs. 13,999 respectively. Both phones are fairly similar, and we have the lower end of the two in for review today. We're going to take a look at the Honor Holly 4 to tell you if it's good enough to unseat the biggest players.    In terms of design, there really isn't anything new or out of the ordinary about the Holly 4. It looks pretty nondescript and won't stand out in a group of similarly priced devices. Despite Honor's liberal use of the words ""metal"" and ""metallic"" in its descriptions of this phone, the body is largely plastic with only a metal plate on the rear. This phone should be relatively compact thanks to its 5-inch screen, but there's still a lot of plastic on the front face. There are no physical or capacitive buttons below the screen, so there's nothing but a silver Honor logo filling that space which actually calls more attention to it. The rear has a matte finish and rounded edges which are both great for grip. At 144g and measuring 8.2mm thick, it's fairly easy to use this phone with one hand. The camera protrudes very slightly, and right below it is the fingerprint sensor which is always within easy reach. The phone's power and volume buttons are on the right, and are also conveniently located. There's a hybrid dual-SIM tray on the left, so you'll have to choose between a microSD card and a second SIM. You'll find a 3.5mm audio socket on the top and a Micro-USB port on the bottom. There are also two grilles on the bottom, though only one of them is actually a speaker. The phone has been launched in grey, silver, and gold, and we had a gold unit for review. Honor didn't send us a full retail package, so we can't comment on the box contents.  When it comes to low-cost phones, every manufacturer tries to one-up the others by pushing better specifications in at each price level. The Honor Holly 4 falls a bit short in this respect, with its Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 SoC, 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage. At this price level, Xiaomi offers its Redmi Note 4 (Review) with a Snapdragon 625 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage, not to mention its 5.5-inch full-HD screen. In comparison, the Honor Holly 4 feels like it's one step behind across every major parameter. Even so, the hardware on offer is still quite respectable. The Snapdragon 430 SoC has four CPU cores running at 1.1GHz and another four at 1.4GHz, plus integrated Adreno 505 graphics. Oddly, although the SoC supports Wi-Fi ac, Honor only claims support for the older, slower Wi-Fi b/g/n standards. You also get Bluetooth 4.1, FM radio, GPS, a 3020mAh battery, 13-megapixel rear camera with flash, and 5-megapixel front camera. There are no extra niceties such as fast charging, a front flash, or in fact anything distinct that might make buyers choose this phone over an otherwise more powerful one. On the software side, we have Huawei's EmotionUI skin, also known as EMUI. Like most other Chinese phonemakers, Huawei believes that it needs to drastically overhaul Android in order to provide value. Sure enough, there are loads of customisations. You'll notice that by default, the lockscreen wallpaper changes each time the phone wakes from sleep - there's even a little control panel that you can use to pause the slideshow. There's also a step counter right above the clock. Once you unlock the phone you'll see a single-layer UI with all app icons spread across the homescreens, but you can switch to a two-layer UI with an app drawer from within the Settings app. There are also options for making the icon grid denser, and swapping the order of the on-screen Android navigation buttons. Honor allows gestures to be performed using the fingerprint sensor, so you can do things like stopping an alarm and scrolling between photos with your index finger. Other features include the ability to lock apps and files with a fingerprint or passcode. For some reason, there's a virus scanner tool baked into the Settings app as well. There's a Themes app but there's only one font and icon set, so all you can really do with it is change the wallpaper. The Phone Manager app has the usual RAM cleanup tool and data traffic stats, plus links to assorted sections within the Settings app. Health shows steps taken and stairs climbed, and can log runs if you trigger it manually. It can show heart rate and sleep information from a paired fitness tracker, but isn't very functional beyond that.  You won't have any problems with the Honor Holly 4 if you don't do much more than making calls, sending messages and using social media apps. It isn't the most responsive, and we did feel minor hiccups when switching between apps or just generally moving around the UI. This is more likely to be because of EMUI's animations than any fault of the hardware. We didn't have trouble playing Dead Trigger 2, but the metal backplate did start to feel warm within just a few minutes. The default Swiftkey keyboard lets you swipe to type, and there are loads of options including colour themes that you can create out of your own photos, detailed statistics, and a clipboard of its own that can remember multiple clips for later retrieval. We found it far too bloated and it was sometimes sluggish. The screen is bright enough to be useful even under sunlight. Colours aren't the most vivid, but the screen is decent overall and we were able to enjoy games and videos just fine. The single speaker can get pretty loud without distortion, but sound isn't very rich or deep. The Honor Holly 4 refused to let us install several of our usual benchmark apps, most notably AnTuTu, Geekbench, GFXBench and PCMark. All other apps were perfectly fine, but we got an ""Error 501"" in the Google Play store with these specific ones, and no amount of troubleshooting could fix it. This is a problem that has been reported with previous Honor devices. We were able to run 3DMark, and got 5,846 in the Ice Storm Extreme test, which isn't great. Quadrant returned an overall score of 12,687. We also ran the browser-based Optane and Basemark Web tests, and got scores of 3,049 and 64.42 respectively.  The Camera app on the Honor Holly 4 offers multiple modes including Pro Photo, Pro Video, Slow-mo, and Document Scan. You also get a few filters and a now-obligatory beautification slider. All settings are easily available if you swipe to the left. One nice touch is that you can double-press the volume down button when the phone is in standby to launch the camera app and immediately take a photo. There's even a little overlay that tells you how long it took to capture a shot - usually between 1.2 and 1.8 seconds. When it comes to image quality, we found that photos taken in daylight lacked detail and exposure was sometimes blown out in frames with light and dark areas. The borders of objects were not very well defined, and textures didn't come through very well. At night, a lot depended on the amount of light available. In some shots, we could barely discern simple objects, but others came out decent enough to look good on the phone's screen. All photos looked okay as long as we didn't examine them at full resolution. Tap to see full-sized Honor Holly 4 photo samples The front camera takes decent selfies that can be used on social media, as long as there's favourable light. Video recording goes up to 1080p with both the front and rear cameras. We found that video taken at this resolution was jerky and that the autofocus was erratic. The quality was also not very impressive. Lower-resolution videos fared a bit better. On the other hand, battery life is a bright spot. We were able to get through a full day of casual usage, including a bit of gaming and video streaming, and had a little bit of power left over. Our HD video loop test ran for 10 hours, 12 minutes. VerdictThe Honor Holly 4 could have been a great phone at this time last year, but it fades in comparison to Xiaomi's rather expansive lineup in the sub-Rs. 15,000 market. Lenovo also has a few great models, including the recently launched Moto G5s series (Review). Honor's own Honor 8 Lite (Review) sells for under Rs. 15,000 and surprisingly, the 32GB version of the Honor 6X (Review) sells at the same price of Rs. 11,999 (though it is soon to be replaced). While the Honor 6X has a very gimmicky dual camera feature, at least it stands out. The new Holly 4 just seems lost in this mix. This phone doesn't excel at any one thing but there's nothing drastically wrong with it to the point that it's unusable. However, even in the aspects that it does have going for it, such as battery life, it's overshadowed by its competition. There's very little reason to get excited by this phone, even if you're a brand loyalist. Honor needs to seriously consider knocking the price down by a few thousand rupees if it wants this model to succeed."
1795,21,htc-desire-10-pro-review-1654498,7,10,2017-02-02,1654498,Roydon Cerejo,HTC Desire 10 Pro Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/htc-desire-10-pro-review-1654498," The Desire 10 Pro is HTC’s latest mid-range smartphone, focusing mainly on design and camera quality. The company launched this phone back in November of last year, but it only went on sale in December. Sitting pretty at Rs. 26,490, the Desire 10 Pro goes up against the likes of the Moto Z Play (Review), Asus ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) (Review) and OnePlus 3 and 3T. All of these are excellent smartphones in our book, which means the Desire 10 Pro needs to have more than just a fancy design for it to be worth recommending. Let's see if can deliver the goods.    HTC has been at the top of its game in recent times when it comes to build quality, and that shows here as well. The Desire 10 Pro has a metal body, which feels great when you hold it, also offers a good amount of grip. There are gold accents running along the edges, camera bump and back that give this phone a very striking look. The ‘Stone Black’ colour option that we received features a rubberised texture for the back, which certainly helps with grip, but also easily attracts scuff marks, some of which refuse to go away. We’re unsure if the other colour trims also have this issue, but if you have your eyes set on the black version then you might want to use a case. HTC has fitted the Desire 10 Pro with a quality display. The 5.5-inch IPS panel produces good levels of brightness with good colours and contrast. The full-HD resolution ensures a decently high pixel count so there’s no visible pixellation of icons and text. There’s Gorilla Glass for added protection too. The display is tuned for a neutral tone by default but you can adjust the colour temperature in the Settings app if needed. The space above the display is a bit taller than the portion below, which makes the phone a bit longer than it should be. The capacitive buttons on the chin of the phone are backlit and responsive.  The power and volume buttons are on the right and have good tactile feedback. The power button also gets some ridges so it’s easily identifiable. On the left of the HTC Desire 10 Pro, you have the hybrid SIM slot that can accommodate two Nano-SIM cards or a Nano-SIM and a microSD card (up to 2TB) to expand the phone's storage. There’s a headphones socket on the top, and a Micro-USB port and speaker grille on the bottom The Desire 10 Pro has a visible camera bump around the back, followed by the LED flash and laser autofocus window just below it. There's also a fingerprint sensor around the back, which is quick at authentication and can double up as a button for snapping a selfie. We’re a little disappointed at the absence of a USB Type-C port here. Another disappointment is the lack of stereo speakers, so HTC's BoomSound enhancement only works with headphones. The Desire 10 Pro ships with a 10W adapter, data cable, and headset. The quality of the bundled accessories is fairly good. Overall, the phone makes a very good first impression thanks to its unique design and superb build quality except for the fact that some of the scuffs and abrasions on the back which result from everyday use are impossible to clean. Under the hood, the HTC Desire 10 Pro packs an octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 SoC, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. These core specifications look solid, and for all intents and purposes, they get the job done. However, when comparing performance in benchmarks to that of other phones in this price band, the Desire 10 Pro doesn't fare very well. The Helio P10 SoC is weaker than a Snapdragon 625, which is evident from the Desire 10 Pro's AnTuTu score of 55,187 and 3DMark Ice Storm unlimited score of 11,163. The Mali T-860 falls a bit short on performance in gaming benchmarks with a score of 18fps in GFXbench, versus an average of 28fps for phones using the Qualcomm chip.  Other specifications of the HTC Desire 10 Pro include Bluetooth 4.2, dual-band Wi-Fi b/g/n, FM radio, USB-OTG, and GPS. NFC and Wi-Fi are notably absent. The phone packs in the usual suite of sensors including a gyroscope. 4G with VoLTE is supported on both SIM slots. The Desire 10 Pro runs a lean version of HTC Sense on top of Android 6.0 Marshmallow, just like the HTC 10 (Review). To avoid duplication of apps that serve the same purposes, HTC has used Google’s apps wherever possible, like Photos for the gallery and Play Music for the music player. The dialler and contacts apps have been cleaned up a bit, and there are some native HTC apps like Weather, Flashlight, and Boost+. The latter lets you manage permissions, clean junk files, and lock apps with the fingerprint scanner. Some third-party apps are pre-installed, such as News Republic, Hungama, Under Armor Record, Facebook, and Instagram. There’s also a Themes app for changing the look of the UI. The Desire 10 Pro takes a hit in benchmarks but in the real world, it does alright. Average RAM usage is generally about 2GB, leaving you with plenty to spare. We barely noticed any slowdowns or stutters during our usage either. One thing we really liked is the fact that this phone barely gets hot, even when performing stressful tasks like shooting videos or gaming. Heavy games like Asphalt 8 run just fine too. The phone is also slim and fairly light, so it’s easy to live with. The mono speaker on the HTC Desire 10 Pro does a good job with alerts, and sound is loud and distinct. The experience is not the best with media files but then that’s expected. Audio through the bundled headphones is good, and gets better with BoomSound enabled. The main camera on the HTC Desire 10 Pro has a 20-megapixel sensor with laser autofocus and an f/2.2 aperture lens. On the front, there’s a 13-megapixel sensor with the same f/2.2 aperture. Both cameras support Auto HDR mode and full-HD video recording. Images captured with the rear camera exhibit good detail and colours. Objects in focus have good sharpness and we didn’t encounter much chromatic aberration either. We found the camera struggling a bit with close-up shots - at times, it would refuse to lock onto subjects, making it quite frustrating to shoot them. Low-light shots are also handled well with fair bit of detail preserved and not much colour noise. Once again, close-ups taken with the HTC Desire 10 Pro were a bit of a struggle to get right. Tap to see full-sized HTC Desire 10 Pro camera samples The camera app also has a ‘Pro’ mode with the ability to shoot in RAW and save the manual settings to three custom profiles, which is a nice addition. Other shooting modes on the HTC Desire 10 Pro include panorama and Zoe camera which captures short video clips. Video recording only goes up to 1080p and the quality is good. The front camera manages detailed selfies, and in low-light, the ‘Retina flash’ feature does come in handy. You can also take a selfie panorama if you’re with a group of friends. The non-removable 3000mAh battery on the HTC Desire 10 Pro will last you through nearly an entire day of regular use. We were able to to a little more than a full day on a single charge. In our HD video loop battery test, we got a runtime of 10 hours and 50 minutes. The HTC Desire 10 Pro supports fast charging too, and the bundled adapter is rated at 10W. VerdictThe HTC Desire 10 Pro is a good device but at Rs. 26,470, its pricing is on the higher side, which makes us think twice before recommending it. The SoC is not the best when you consider other Android smartphones around this segment that pack faster ones, and this phone also misses out on some conveniences like a Type-C USB connector, NFC, and Wi-Fi 802.11ac. This phone would be worth considering at around Rs. 20,000, and paying anything more is a big ask. The Moto Z Play and Asus ZenFone 3 (ZE552KL) both offer better value for a bit less. On the other hand, if you want something more future-proof, you could spend a bit more and get the OnePlus 3 or OnePlus 3T, whichever fits your budget. However, if you've considered all the competition and still really like the Desire 10 Pro looks you can pick it up from HTC India’s online store. HTC Desire 10 Pro in pictures"
1088,21,htc-one-e9s-dual-sim-review-768692,7,10,2015-11-24,768692,Ali Pardiwala,HTC One E9s Dual SIM Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/htc-one-e9s-dual-sim-review-768692,"  The Taiwanese manufacturer hasn't quite given up just yet, and one of its latest launches in India is the HTC One E9s Dual SIM. The device is a part of the top-end One range of products, but is more affordable than its flagship namesakes. With its plastic body and typically mid-range spec-sheet, the One E9s Dual SIM, on paper, seems like an overpriced mid-range smartphone. We find out if there's more to it in our review. Look and feelAlthough the One E9s Dual SIM is to be considered among the top tier of HTC smartphones, its plastic body makes it feel more like some of the newer products in the second-rung Desire range, such as the slightly more affordable but much older HTC Desire 826. It also exhibits HTC's typical aesthetic, which isn't a bad thing at all since HTC is one of the few manufacturers to consistently excel at smartphone design, in our opinion. With a 5.5-inch screen, the One E9s Dual SIM is firmly in phablet territory. The front of the device is only 66.3 percent screen, with considerably thick borders and space on both the top and bottom for the stereo BoomSound speakers. For a phone that is already large, this bulks it up further. Fortunately, it isn't as thick as most phablets, and its curved edges and dull plastic finish help with grip and ergonomics.   The top of the One E9s Dual SIM has the 3.5mm socket, the USB port is on the bottom, the power and volume buttons are on the right, and the SIM and microSD slots are under a flap on the left. The back of the phone is stark and minimalist, with just an HTC logo in the centre and the camera and flash in the top left corner. Although the device does not have a unibody, the back panel cannot be opened, which means the battery is not removable. The screen of the device is a 5.5-inch 720p capacitive touch display. Although official sources don't specify the screen type, some listings on e-commerce portals state that it is an Amoled display. On the face of it, the screen has some of the typical characteristics of Amoled displays, including deep blacks, good contrast, lower possible brightness and issues with daylight readability. However, the resolution is far too low for a smartphone that costs over Rs. 20,000 today, and the lack of detail is particularly visible because of the size of the screen. Considering that the OnePlus X (Review | Pictures) packs in a far better full-HD Amoled screen at a lower price, the HTC One E9s Dual SIM comes off as overpriced for the quality it offers. Specifications and softwareThis year, HTC has opted for MediaTek SoCs for some of its key devices, including the Helio X10 which found its way onto the M9+ and E9+. The E9s Dual SIM, however, reminds us of its mid-range specifications with its MT6752M SoC. Designed to compete directly with Qualcomm, the MT6752M gets the better of the Snapdragon 615 SoC in most benchmarks. However, opinions are firmly divided on whether the MT6752M can truly compete against the Snapdragon 615. Apart from this, the HTC One E9s Dual SIM also has 16GB of internal storage (expandable by up to 128GB), 2GB of RAM, an integrated Mali-T760MP2 GPU, dual-SIM connectivity with 4G on both SIMs, and a 2600mAh battery. Fortunately, the slots for microSD and the second SIM are separate, so you aren't forced to choose between them, unlike some other recent smartphones. The E9s Dual SIM runs Android Lollipop 5.0, with HTC's Sense 7 user interface on top. Although Sense 7 is not very different from Sense 6 visually, there are some useful changes under the hood. This includes the untying of key apps (Gallery, Camera, Sense Home and HTC Backup, for example) from the UI so that they can be updated individually through the Play Store, rather than needing an overall update of the UI.   Also worth mentioning is the ability to customise navigation controls and add a fourth icon alongside the three default Android keys, more colour personalisation options, and the excellent Sense Home widget, which learns what apps you often use based on location and time and gives you easy access to them. HTC's software has been among the best manufacturer UIs around, and remains efficient and functional in its design. UI performance is quick and problem-free. CameraThe HTC One E9s Dual SIM has a 13-megapixel primary camera with single-tone flash, along with the 4-megapixel UltraPixel camera on the front with no flash. The UltraPixel sensor was HTC's supposedly innovative take on smartphone cameras, but has since been demoted to front-camera status for some of HTC's new devices. Both cameras are capable of recording full-HD video. The default HTC Camera app is excellent as always, with plenty of controls, modes and options. The flash toggle and manual controls are easy to access, and there is a button to quickly shoot video as well. Switching camera modes can be done via swipes or through the menu, while camera and video modes are also accessible easily. The settings menu has a long list of options, including crop ratio, resolution, volume button shortcuts, self-timer, and image adjustments, among others. The app strikes the perfect balance between ease of use and detailed controls and settings.   The camera itself is decent for a phone at this price, thanks to its backside illuminated sensor. In normal light, images came out fairly detailed and lighting conditions are reproduced accurately. Colours were also vibrant and accurate. As expected, low-light shots were considerably better than we're used to as well, brightening up typically dark scenes fairly well. Video benefits from the sensor greatly, and is incredibly clean in terms of motion and detail. The UltraPixel camera up front is also very capable in low light, thanks to the larger pixel size. This helps with any selfies you might want to take in dimly lit places, as well as outdoors.   PerformanceThanks to decent hardware and excellent software, the HTC One E9s Dual SIM is a decent mid-range performer. Whether it's simply swiping about on the interface or playing intensive games such as Dead Trigger 2 and Angry Birds 2, the phone doesn't disappoint. The phone does heat up very slightly when it's put through intensive tasks, but it's much less than what we're used to seeing on some other smartphones.  We ran our usual suite of benchmark tests on the HTC One E9s Dual SIM, and results were decent for a phone in this price range. The phone got an impressive 23fps in GFXBench, and also maxed out the 3DMark Ice Storm test that we usually use to test smartphones with 720p screens, returning a score of 5,960 in Ice Storm Extreme. AnTuTu and Quadrant returned scores of 42,114 and 19,075 respectively, both which are a little higher than what we're used to seeing on mid-range smartphones. In our battery test, the HTC One E9s Dual SIM ran for 11 hours, 21 minutes, which is decent for a phone with such a large screen. Part of it is thanks to the low-resolution Amoled display, which is easy on the battery. In day-to-day use, the phone easily lasted us the whole day on a full charge. Other typical functions such as call and signal quality, as well as audio through the speakers or headphones, were decent.   VerdictThe HTC One E9s Dual SIM is a good smartphone, no doubt. It has everything you need from a mid-range device, including good design, decent specifications, good cameras and enough bite in the performance to keep mid-range users happy. However, HTC needs to do a bit more than that to get buyers' attention in this competitive market, and One E9s Dual SIM unfortunately doesn't have anything out-of-the-box to offer. While the Amoled screen is decent, it's low resolution is evident, and this is severely disappointing for a device at this price level. It also costs far too much when compared to devices such as the Honor 7 (Review | Pictures), which offers much more bang for your buck. The HTC One E9s Dual SIM will lose out against such competitors because it is a straightforward and unexciting device. However, if you're only looking for reliability and functionality, it's definitely worth considering."
1058,21,iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-review-786021,8,10,2016-06-15,786021,Kunal Dua,iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-review-786021," For most of the reviews here at Gadgets 360, we use the mobile in question as our primary phone for about a week or so before sharing our verdict with you. We realise this isn't perfect, since there are some aspects of the device that don't become obvious during that time, and in an ideal world, we'd use every phone for a couple of months before we publish our review. But we work under constraints where most devices aren't available to us for that long - almost all products that we review are loaned to us by companies for short durations - and there's also the competitive pressure of wanting to get your review out before others do, as long as it doesn't involve cutting any corners. With the launch of iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus in India, Apple offered to loan the two new iPhones to Gadgets 360 - and indeed other publications - for more than the typical timeframe of a few days. The India iPhone launch of course came a few weeks after it was available in the US and several other countries, which meant that there were enough reviews out there for us not to worry about timelines too much. This gave us an ideal opportunity to spend more time than we'd initially imagined with the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus and share our thoughts two months into using them.  The extra time also gave us more time to think about the development of the iPhone line in the future, and tie that in with information that has come to light in the recent weeks. Strap yourselves in, because you are in for a long ride. Look and feelWe were using the iPhone 6 as our primary phone before our rather lengthy experiment for the sake of this review, and we remember that the iPhone 6s felt noticeably heavier when we first picked it up, and this difference really threw us off our game for the first 24 hours. We imagine the experience would be pretty much the same if you switched from an iPhone 6 Plus to an iPhone 6s Plus. For a company that's obsessed with making its products thinner and lighter, shipping flagship products that are both heavier and thicker than their predecessors is an interesting decision, and one that may not have been taken lightly at Cupertino.  We understand the new 3D Touch sensors are to be blamed for the extra weight, but in the absence of any official information from Apple, it's difficult to be certain. A couple of days into the review process, however, we'd gotten used to the new weight of the phone, and this is where we hope against hope that Apple takes a lesson when designing future iPhone models. The lesson of course is that people aren't as obsessed with 'thin and light' as the product designers at Cupertino, and they can get used to a little bit of extra weight pretty quickly. So dear Apple designers, when you figure out how to make the 3D Touch panels thinner and lighter, can you fill that remaining space with a bigger battery? We won't complain, we promise. We wouldn't hold our breath on Apple actually listening to that feedback, but that doesn't mean we stop trying, right? It seems as if every iPhone is greeted by a controversy that rears its head around launch time and before you realise, it has taken on a life of its own. If it was iPhone 4 and Antennagate - a problem that was as real as physics itself - then in 2014 we had one-part truth, one-part fiction, and all-parts YouTube sensation called Bendgate. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, as you may remember, were shown to be prone to bending if you, well, tried to bend them with a great amount of force (what a surprise). The topic eventually died down, but one wonders if reverberations of the controversy are being seen in the build of the newest iPhone models. While there was no mention of Bendgate when Apple launched the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, our thoughts went back to last year's controversy when Apple announced that the new iPhone models are made out of 7000 series aluminium alloy, a grade of metal that's also used in the aerospace industry. Sceptics may see this as an acknowledgement that Bendgate was real, while others may see it as a natural design evolution. The iPhone 6s Plus comes with a 5.5-inch display but in terms of overall size it rivals some 6-inch devices in the Android world. This is something we had criticised during our review of the iPhone 6 Plus last year, and since we are on an 'S' cycle, we didn't expect it to change this year. Manufacturers who don't call Cupertino their home have been making big screen phones for a while now and they have evolved their designs to the point where there is hardly any bezel on the sides. In contrast, much like their predecessors, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus have very prominent bezels and space both above and below the screen, which translates into a poor screen-to-body ratio for Apple's phones.  We can count on Apple reducing the bezels on the sides of the screen, but making the iPhone shorter while retaining the same display size might prove to be a bigger challenge. The physical Home button - which has evolved over the years to also house the Touch ID fingerprint scanner - has always been the centrepiece of the user interaction paradigm on iOS. Android phones on the other hand can choose to have on-screen buttons, which gives manufacturers more flexibility with their designs. Given how important the Home button is on iOS, it will be interesting to see how Apple goes about making a 5.5-inch screen that's easier to carry around. Since we've been carrying around the new iPhones for over a couple of months, you'd perhaps be curious about the wear and tear visible on the devices. As you can see from the images, there are practically no signs of wear and tear on these phones, even though we've been using them without any sort of a case. Having said that, as someone who treats their gadgets like their first-born, our usage doesn't replicate the real-world experience of most users, and it's safe to assume the wear and tear is no different than what you've experienced on previous iPhone models. The new Pink Rose Gold colour doesn't seem any worse than its older counterparts in this regard. 3D TouchTraditionally, the S series of iPhones are seen as minor upgrades, since they look just like the predecessors. However, the S models have also introduced some marquee features over the years. The iPhone 4S - or iPhone 4s as Apple now wants us to write it - was the first iPhone to ship with Siri, Apple's virtual assistant. The iPhone 5s brought with it the Touch ID, a dual-LED flash, and it was also the first iPhone to ship with a motion co-processor, the M7, and it came with iOS 7, a major overhaul to Apple's mobile OS, though obviously other iOS devices got the update as well. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus continue this tradition by bringing their fair share of improvements. The first new headline feature is 3D Touch, a variant of the Force Touch technology that debuted in the Apple Watch and has since found its way into other devices such as the MacBook as well as accessories. There's been some confusion around what 3D Touch is - a lot has been written about it, yet some continue to think it is nothing but the latest trick from the marketing team at Cupertino in making everyone thing Apple has 'invented' something that exists in every touchscreen phone out there. Not much has changed in the new iPhones as far as the display is concerned While some think 3D Touch is nothing but a long press, in simple terms, it's more of a hard press of the screen. Traditionally, screens have been capable of detecting the point where the user is pressing the display. Then came multi-touch displays that could detect more than one pressure point, making multi-touch gestures like pinch-to-zoom possible. Until now - and this admittedly is an oversimplification of sorts - the pressure sensitivity sensors have been binary in nature - an 'on' state indicating the user is pressing the screen at that point, and an 'off' state indicating an absence of touch. With 3D Touch, this becomes a continuous scale, with the hardware now capable of detecting the amount of pressure you put at each point. Touch-screen devices have traditionally achieved pressure sensitivity by putting this technology in stylus, which can detect how hard you are pressing the stylus against the screen and then pass this information to the software, to take the required action. Admittedly, 3D Touching the display the first few times takes some getting used to, and instances where you fail to trigger it because you didn't put enough force, or just absentmindedly put too much force and accidentally invoked it are common initially. As you would expect, 3D Touch has been made possible by putting a series of sensors underneath the display, increasing the overall weight of the new iPhones as we discussed before. Given what you need to do to trigger the action, the original name - Force Touch - was perhaps more accurate as far as capturing its essence is concerned. The 3D Touch name, however, comes from the pressure sensitivity being sort of a Z axis to the X and Y axis that represent where the user is tapping the screen. Armed with this additional bit of information, software developers can do a whole lot of things that weren't possible earlier. Apple talks about two ways in which applications can use 3D Touch - Quick Actions and Peek & Pop, but that's barely scratching the surface. You can 3D Touch app icons on the home screen to reveal a set of Quick Actions - existing functionality within the app that you can quickly jump to, when you would've traditionally needed to launch the app and then trigger that feature. The default Camera app, for example, lets you quickly jump to selfie mode via 3D Touch, while the Messages app lets you start a conversation with contacts you frequently chat with (in case you are wondering, the contacts in the list are not from your Favourites list, nor are they recent contacts; our guess is they are inspired by Siri Suggestions). Third-party apps need to be updated to add support for these actions, and most of the popular apps have done just that.   You can, for example, quickly resume the podcast you were listening to with Overcast, one of our favourite apps from 2015. Facebook, via Quick Actions, lets you start writing a post or take/ upload a photo or video straight from the home screen. Whether these actions are actually faster than launching the app and switching to that particular option is debatable. That's particularly true with the bigger iPhone 6s Plus, where 3D Touching an icon on parts of the screen that are not easily accessible requires a certain amount of control and precision that one isn't capable of at all times. However, if thoughtfully done, 3D Touch can indeed save you some time and a few taps. Our favourite implementation is perhaps in the Twitterrific app, which lets you quickly switch Twitter accounts, perfect when you spend most of your time using one Twitter account, but want to get something off your chest via another account in a jiffy. In Mail, Messages, and Notes, 3D Touching anywhere on the on-screen keyboard turns it into an onscreen 'trackpad', making it easier to quickly move around the text and make selections. Also, you can 3D Touch the left edge of the display while you are on the home screen to bring up the multitasking view, which is a quieter alternative to doing it by double pressing the home button. Peek and Pop are Apple's implementations for adding 3D Touch related functionality within apps. You can take a peek (aka quick look, not to be confused with Quick Look on OS X) at a mail by 3D touching the List view in the Mail app and let go to get back to the list, potentially saving you the gesture of tapping and then swiping back. If, while taking a peek, you decide you need to respond to this message, you can swipe up to see a list of preset replies. Similarly, you can 3D Touch to preview a link without needing to open it in Safari.  As we mentioned earlier, not only can the sensors on the new iPhones differentiate between 3D Touch and a regular touch, but they can detect everything in between as well. This enables developers to build all kinds of applications that were not possible earlier. Game developers, for example, can now let you choose between gently prying the door open and entering secretly or swinging it wide open by simply detecting the amount of pressure you are putting on the on-screen door. Other great implementations of 3D Touch are coming from third-party developers as well. Magic Piano app, for instance, detects how hard you are pressing down on the virtual keys on screen and adjusts the playback volume accordingly, just like a real piano. Someone even figured out a way to convert your iPhone into a weighing scale, though that's unlikely to find its way into the App Store anytime soon.  One challenge with 3D Touch is that of discoverability. Apart from the icons on the home screen, most 3D Touch actions aren't exactly intuitive, which means you will need to keep randomly 3D Touching at various places to discover new actions - for example multitasking shortcut we mentioned earlier is something you'd either discover by accident or by reading on Apple's website. Even on the home screen, the only way to know which apps support Quick Actions is to 3D Touch them and wait for feedback. Thankfully, the new haptic engine is excellent at giving feedback  on when a 3D Touch action is available and when it isn't. While it's clear that 3D Touch will change the way we interact with apps, in the short term there will be some concerns over usability and discoverability. New Touch IDThe new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus also come with a new, faster Touch ID implementation. As always, Touch ID works great other than on occasions when your fingers are wet, which is expected and and not too much of a bother. Apple says the new Touch IDs are faster than before, and we believe them, because this is perhaps our single biggest problem with the new iPhones - the Touch ID is too damn fast. Until the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, unlocking the iPhone has been a two-stage process, though it usually happens fast enough that most people with Touch ID wouldn't be able to notice the two steps. The first stage involved pressing the home button to wake up the display, and the second is keeping the button pressed to unlock the phone. This two-stage process gave you enough time to wake up the phone's display to, say, check the time or notifications, but let you remove the finger quickly enough that it doesn't unlock the phone. For us - and likely everyone else - this habit has become so ingrained, they wouldn't even realise all this until they switch to the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus. The Touch ID sensor in the new phones is so fast, that the second stage of the process is eliminated. The moment you wake up the phone's display, the phone is unlocked as well, which is infuriating if all you wanted to do is see the time.  We've found ourselves using our knuckles to tap the home button when we want to see the time, which is inconvenient to say the least. Of course a simpler solution would be delete either one of the thumbs or one of our index fingers from Touch ID configuration - yes, we like having all four of them configured - and make that digit the 'designated presser' but that's far from perfect. A simpler way is to press the power button on the side to wake up the display, and it's possible many reading this review are used to doing just that, in which case they must be wondering what we are fussing all about. In our experience, that may be convenient when you already have your hands around the phone, but in all other scenarios - for example when you are taking it out of your pocket or when it's lying next to you - it isn't the most accessible solution. One way Apple can solve this is by adding support for waking up the display by simply double tapping the screen. This is something many big-screen Android phones have done, and it's a feature we find particularly handy. Another way to approach this would be add to the iPhone technology similar to Motorola's Active Display, which provides information like time and notifications automatically on the lock screen, when even the display is powered off. That, of course, would require a switch away from the LCD display that iPhone models have traditionally used, to Amoled display. This is because LCD displays don't let you wake up only parts of the display to show information as needed for Active Display - you need to wake up the entire screen, which means wasting battery life if you are switching on the screen without an explicit command from the user. With Amoled display, you can efficiently wake up only those bits of the screen where you need to show something, so we won't be surprised if Apple makes the switch to Amoled displays as has been rumoured, and brings in Active Display-like technology to make living with faster Touch IDs a whole lot easier.  PerformanceAs you'd expect, the new iPhone models come with beefed up internal specifications as well. There's the new 'desktop class' A9 chip and now 2GB of RAM, a first as far as iPhones are concerned. We've never faced any performance issues on iPhones when they are new, and indeed they tend to age better than their Android counterparts as far as performance is concerned, despite the relatively modest hardware specifications. This of course is down to the fact Apple owns both hardware and software on this side of the smartphone galaxy, which means it can achieve optimisations that are outside the reach of most other manufacturers. The A9 chip is powerful enough that you can edit two 4K streams at once on your iPhone, which is a lot of power to pack in a device that you can carry in your pocket, and something that would've been unthinkable not too long ago. While multitasking in its true sense is limited on iOS, the extra RAM is welcome, especially when you go back to a Safari tab after a while and find it does not need to reload anymore, which is something most longtime iOS users would recognise as a frustration with earlier models. We never really faced any performance issues, though apart from the changes we've documented earlier, there are few real world improvements when compared to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Anyone with an earlier iPhone will definitely notice a sea change, but then you could perhaps say that for anyone moving to a device that's two generations or more newer. We did face one recurring niggle with the iPhone 6s Plus though. Several times, we'd lock our phone in portrait mode only to find the icons in landscape mode when the phone unlocked, and it took 1-2 seconds for the phone to regain its real orientation. iOS 9.2 seemed to fix this, but a few days later the problem reared its ugly head again, albeit we don't experience this behaviour as frequently as we did before.  Did we say earlier our biggest complaint with the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus is that the fingerprint scanner is way too fast? That's because Apple spoilt us by loaning us 128GB iPhone models, when most people will end up buying the 16GB base model. Out of those 16GB, a 12GB is available to users on a brand new phone for storing apps, music, photos, videos, and other data. We don't believe that's enough, especially when you consider the new iPhones can shoot 4K video, which means you can use over 1GB of space by recording just 3 minutes of video by Apple's own estimates. In the two months that we've been using our iPhone 6s Plus, we've captured nearly 8.5GB of photos and videos, and we are nowhere near as prolific in terms of clicking pictures as many people these days. We - and indeed many others - have brought this up with Apple and it's clear the company doesn't believe it's a problem. An Apple representative told Gadgets 360 that customer satisfaction with 16GB iPhone models is extremely high, though he refused to get into the specifics. To its credit, Apple has done a lot to make it easier to live with limited storage with the likes of iCloud Photos, Apple Music, and even making it easier to upgrade to new versions of the OS if your phone is low on storage, a reaction to the problems users faced when upgrading to iOS 8. (Also see: iPhone or iPad Full? Try These 4 Ways to Expand Its Storage) Of course all this means spending a bit more money to get the most out of your phone - Rs. 60 a month to get 50GB space on iCloud to backup those photos automatically, Rs. 120 per month to have access to all the music in the world (well not exactly ""all"", but you get the idea) on demand, and a fast 3G/ 4G connection to make sure all this works when you want it. Apple has even developed a technology called app thinning that makes apps smaller in size, freeing up space on your iOS device for other stuff. All this means it's a little easier to live with a 16GB phone, but we really wish Apple had offered users a bit more breathing room by bumping the base storage to 32GB. (Also see: Now Get 50GB iCloud Storage at Rs. 65 per Month) SoftwareThe new iPhones of course ship with iOS 9, the newest version of Apple's mobile operating system. There are some software features that are tied to the new hardware - like 3D Touch-related tweaks and Live Photos (see below), but for the most part, iOS 9 enhancements are available to older hardware as well, and we've covered them in depth before. We'd still like to highlight a few points we noticed during the considerable time that we spent with the new phones. If you are someone who tried Siri on iPhone 4S and then forgot about it because the performance was fairly hit and miss, then you'd be pleasantly surprised by how far we've come from those days. Siri of course was recently updated to work better with Indian accents, and it can do a lot more as well, although its full potential remains unfulfilled in India and some other regions. We love the ability to ask questions like ""What's the score between Liverpool and Manchester United?"" and ""Who has the most goals for Southampton this season?"" and receiving fast, on-the-spot answers. (Also see: iOS 9 Brings Better Battery Life, Smarter Siri, and More) If you are an Apple Music subscriber - at Rs. 120 per month in India, it's one of the best value deals going around - you can even tell Siri which song (or genre) you are in the mood for, and hear your phone start belting it out in on time. Siri now also works hands free, in that your phone is constantly listening for you to say 'Hey Siri' so it can automatically invoke Siri without you needing to press any buttons. This is similar to the 'Ok Google' functionality on some Android phones.  You can invoke Spotlight by swiping right from the first home screen, and apart from the search box, you will see four contacts and apps listed there. These are not the four most recent apps or contacts; instead Siri is trying to guess the apps you might need or the people you might need to get in touch with. Unfortunately this is definitely not Siri's strongest suit and we can't say we care much for this feature. (Also see: iOS 9 Search Showing Too Many Results? Here's a Simple Fix) If you use Apple's built-in email client, you can enjoy certain other features as well. Many people include their phone number as part of emails they send you. iOS 9 scans this information and the next time this individual calls you, the name of the person who sent the email pops up right next to the number. The first time this happens it's a little freaky as it seems Truecaller's Android avatar has magically installed itself on your phone, but this is definitely a handy feature. Apple of course stresses that all this processing is happening on your device itself and nothing is being sent to the cloud and that no Truecaller-like global registry of numbers is at work here either. Similarly, if emails you receive mention an event like a restaurant confirmation or a flight reservation, iOS 9 can create a suggested event in your calendar. Apple claims to have made some underlying improvements in iOS 9 that offer up to an hour of additional usage time with the device under similar conditions, but we didn't notice any difference when we upgraded our iPhone 6 from iOS 8 to iOS 9, and we didn't spot much of a difference between the battery life of our new iPhone 6s compared to last year's iOS 8-running iPhone 6.  iOS 9 brings a new feature called Wi-Fi Assist that's a boon for those who stream content from wireless drives, as they can now use their phones cellular data to stay connected to the Internet at the same time. Of course it works with other Wi-Fi networks as well. Earlier, if you were on a Wi-Fi network and its Internet connection died or was erratic, you'd have to manually switch off Wi-Fi and move to cellular data. With [Wi-Fi assist] - which is on by default, but can be toggled off - the OS automatically switches to cellular data in case of problems with your Wi-Fi's Internet connection. However, you may end up eating into your cellular bandwidth without realising, so you may want to turn this feature off. (Also see: 20 Awesome Hidden Features of iOS 9) While the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are identical in most respects of software, there's one big difference - just like the previous generation, the bigger iPhone model gets a fully-featured landscape mode, which isn't very common in the smartphone world. Apps like Messages and Mail offer an iPad-like view, making good use of the additional real estate, though the keyboard in landscape-view takes some getting used to. We wish some other tweaks introduced in iOS 9 like the pop-out video player were also available on the bigger iPhone. (Also see: 15 iOS 9 Features That Make Your iPhone and iPad Better Than Ever)  Overall though, iOS 9 is a solid improvement on its predecessor. We won't go into the whole iOS vs. Android debate as we believe both operating systems have now matured to be very similar to each other despite the fundamental differences that set them apart, but we do wish Apple's services worked better in India. Spending over Rs. 50,000 on a phone and finding out it can't prompt you to leave for your meeting because Apple Maps doesn't support directions or traffic updates in India - something even a Rs. 5,000 Android phone can do thanks to Google Now - is extremely frustrating in 2016.  Camera and battery lifeOther than 3D Touch and faster Touch ID, the other big area of improvement in the new iPhone models is the camera. The rear camera has been bumped up to 12 megapixels while the front shooter now comes with a 5-megapixel sensor. The rear camera can now record 4K video, a first for iOS devices, but a few Android devices have been boasting of this capability for a while. Apple says the cameras that the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus ship with are identical, except for the presence of optical image stabilisation (OIS) in the latter. This was the case with the previous generation iPhones as well, though with the latest models, OIS on the Plus now works with videos as well. The headline new feature as far as the cameras in the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are concerned is Live Photos. With Live Photos turned on - toggling it is as easy as switching HDR mode or flash on or off - the phone captures a still photo as usual, but also a small low-resolution video of the moments leading up to and just after the still capture. When you are going through your pictures in the Photos app, Live Photos show up as small animations, and you can 3D Touch the image to see the complete Live Photo, complete with video as well as audio. Under the hood, you will find that every Live Photo is saved as two distinct files - one jpg as usual, and another mov file that was anywhere between 1.5 and 3.5MB in our experience. This means if you are on 16GB phone without iCloud Photos, you may want to keep your Live Photos usage to a minimum. (Also see: iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus: How to Use Live Photos) You can view Live Photos on any iOS device running iOS 9 or any Mac running El Capitan. If you share a Live Photo with, say, an Android user or someone running Windows, it will seem like a regular photo to them, as they will just see the still capture. Live Photos - which, as a concept, isn't too dissimilar to what the likes of BlackBerry and HTC had once offered to their users - give a nice context to every image when you are looking back at your album a few weeks after they were clicked. In our experience, they work best when you are clicking shots of your kids or pets, or other times when those moments leading up to or just after the capture can add a lot of value. Otherwise, in a world where people manufacture moments for the perfect selfie - and Live Photos works with the front camera as well - there may not be many takers for a feature that aims to capture stuff that is a little bit more candid. As far as overall performance of the rear camera is concerned, this might be the first time since the original iPhone came out that Apple doesn't have the phone with the best camera. While the iPhones continue to be a great bet for clicking pictures that accurately captures the colours that we see in everyday life, their performance under less than ideal lighting conditions that most people experience indoors on an everyday basis isn't quite up to the same standard as Samsung's recent flagships. (Sample shot by iPhone 6s Plus (left/ top) and iPhone 6s (right). Tap to see full-sized images) In daylight, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus capture accurate colours and enough detail, but in low-light conditions - where the iPhone 6s Plus fares better than the 6s due to the presence of OIS - the two aren't quite at the same level as the likes of Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and Note 5, which are able to capture more light than any competing smartphone. Having said that, the picture quality is still excellent - especially on the 6s Plus - and most will be more than happy with the results they see on their iPhone. (iPhone 6s Plus sample HDR image. Tap to see in full size.) Apple's camera app makes it dead simple to take panorama shots as well as time-lapse and slo-mo videos, and is perhaps the most user friendly app out there, albeit one that offers few customisations other than exposure control. Pro users wanting a bit more control over their shots are best off downloading a third-party app from the App Store.  With the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, the front camera gets a bump in resolution to 5 megapixels, which is really welcome because the selfie camera on the iPhone was really starting to show its age. The pictures clicked with this are a huge improvement over what we saw with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and there is also one new feature that in our opinion makes this the best selfie-camera out there. The new Retina Flash feature turns the entire display (operating at three times its normal brightness) into a flash you can use while capturing selfies in poor lighting conditions. While the idea isn't exactly new - other manufacturers have experimented with this in the past - Apple has the implementation nailed down perfectly. While we are no fans of using flash while clicking pictures, we realise most phones have it on 'auto' by default, and a majority don't bother changing this settings. Having seen the results with both rear and front flash turned out on the new iPhones, we rest easy knowing that fewer people will be ruining their photos by leaving the flash unnecessarily switched on. (iPhone 6s Plus sample image - tap for full size.) Finally, let's talk about the battery life of the new iPhone models. We got 10 hours and 42 minutes of playback time in our video loop test with the iPhone 6s, which is a marked improvement compared to what we experienced with its predecessor, but the real world usage experience was virtually identical to what we got with the iPhone 6. This is no surprise given that the batteries inside the new iPhone models are only a little bit smaller compared to those powering the previous generation. We got 8 hours and 7 minutes of video playback with the 6s Plus, another reversal of sorts, considering the figure stood at 11 hours and 4 minutes with the iPhone 6 Plus. Once again, our real world experience was pretty much identical between the 6s Plus and the 6 Plus. The smaller iPhone 6s will easily last through a day of moderate usage, but anything more strenuous and you will find yourself reaching for the charger. Despite its higher resolution display, the bigger iPhone 6s Plus will have a little bit left in the tank even at the end of a busy day. VerdictWhile this review may have been slightly different, we must answer the same old question - should you consider buying the new iPhone models? First, let's compare the two phones themselves. While the iPhone 6s Plus is rather ungainly to use on an everyday basis, its better camera and battery life make it Apple's 'real' flagship phone that we feel people should consider getting. You would probably want to get the 64GB version, which means you are looking at spending Rs. 82,000 in India, notwithstanding the recent discounts. Let's face it - that's a lot of money to be spending on a phone, which will be outdated in a few months when the newer, shinier models come out. The one saving grace is that, recent developments notwithstanding, the iPhones - and indeed most of Apple hardware - tend to hold their value better than their competitors, and if you take good care of your phones, you can recover a substantial chunk of that money 12 months down the line. Indeed, resale sites offer up to Rs. 30,000 for your 16GB iPhone 6 as long as it's in excellent condition and you have its box and all its accessories, which is more than what some new Android flagships and 'flagship killers' retail for, making it easier to upgrade when a new model comes out. With Live Photos, improved camera performance, and faster touch ID are nice - the latter being annoying as well - 3D Touch is perhaps the biggest improvement in the new iPhone models, and one that will definitely find its way to more phones in the future, and not just ones made by Apple. However, it will be a while before developers are ready to make full use of its potential, which means if you already have an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus, you can perhaps skip this 'S' generation. For anyone with an older iPhone, the upgrade is definitely big enough to be compelling, though the prospect of a radical new design with the next generation of iPhones is something one must always contend with while making a buying decision at this time. If you are platform agnostic, you could buy any one of Samsung's recent phones - the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6 Edge+, Galaxy Note 5 - and rest easy knowing you have a phone that's as good as Apple's newest flagships with a camera that performs better in low light conditions, saving a big chunk of cash along the way. The Edge series of smartphones also feature a striking new design, words we didn't think we would ourselves saying when talking about a Samsung phone 18 months ago. Of course some believe that the days of expensive flagship smartphones themselves are numbered, and no one should be spending more than Rs. 20,000 (if that) on a phone anymore. While there's some merit to that statement, we believe the top level of smartphones - and perhaps only the likes of Apple and Samsung's flagships belong at that level anymore - still manage to differentiate themselves from the crowd. Whether that difference is worth a significant premium is something that we will see play out in 2016."
1058,21,iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-review-786021,8,10,2016-06-15,786021,Kunal Dua,iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-review-786021," For most of the reviews here at Gadgets 360, we use the mobile in question as our primary phone for about a week or so before sharing our verdict with you. We realise this isn't perfect, since there are some aspects of the device that don't become obvious during that time, and in an ideal world, we'd use every phone for a couple of months before we publish our review. But we work under constraints where most devices aren't available to us for that long - almost all products that we review are loaned to us by companies for short durations - and there's also the competitive pressure of wanting to get your review out before others do, as long as it doesn't involve cutting any corners. With the launch of iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus in India, Apple offered to loan the two new iPhones to Gadgets 360 - and indeed other publications - for more than the typical timeframe of a few days. The India iPhone launch of course came a few weeks after it was available in the US and several other countries, which meant that there were enough reviews out there for us not to worry about timelines too much. This gave us an ideal opportunity to spend more time than we'd initially imagined with the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus and share our thoughts two months into using them.  The extra time also gave us more time to think about the development of the iPhone line in the future, and tie that in with information that has come to light in the recent weeks. Strap yourselves in, because you are in for a long ride. Look and feelWe were using the iPhone 6 as our primary phone before our rather lengthy experiment for the sake of this review, and we remember that the iPhone 6s felt noticeably heavier when we first picked it up, and this difference really threw us off our game for the first 24 hours. We imagine the experience would be pretty much the same if you switched from an iPhone 6 Plus to an iPhone 6s Plus. For a company that's obsessed with making its products thinner and lighter, shipping flagship products that are both heavier and thicker than their predecessors is an interesting decision, and one that may not have been taken lightly at Cupertino.  We understand the new 3D Touch sensors are to be blamed for the extra weight, but in the absence of any official information from Apple, it's difficult to be certain. A couple of days into the review process, however, we'd gotten used to the new weight of the phone, and this is where we hope against hope that Apple takes a lesson when designing future iPhone models. The lesson of course is that people aren't as obsessed with 'thin and light' as the product designers at Cupertino, and they can get used to a little bit of extra weight pretty quickly. So dear Apple designers, when you figure out how to make the 3D Touch panels thinner and lighter, can you fill that remaining space with a bigger battery? We won't complain, we promise. We wouldn't hold our breath on Apple actually listening to that feedback, but that doesn't mean we stop trying, right? It seems as if every iPhone is greeted by a controversy that rears its head around launch time and before you realise, it has taken on a life of its own. If it was iPhone 4 and Antennagate - a problem that was as real as physics itself - then in 2014 we had one-part truth, one-part fiction, and all-parts YouTube sensation called Bendgate. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, as you may remember, were shown to be prone to bending if you, well, tried to bend them with a great amount of force (what a surprise). The topic eventually died down, but one wonders if reverberations of the controversy are being seen in the build of the newest iPhone models. While there was no mention of Bendgate when Apple launched the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, our thoughts went back to last year's controversy when Apple announced that the new iPhone models are made out of 7000 series aluminium alloy, a grade of metal that's also used in the aerospace industry. Sceptics may see this as an acknowledgement that Bendgate was real, while others may see it as a natural design evolution. The iPhone 6s Plus comes with a 5.5-inch display but in terms of overall size it rivals some 6-inch devices in the Android world. This is something we had criticised during our review of the iPhone 6 Plus last year, and since we are on an 'S' cycle, we didn't expect it to change this year. Manufacturers who don't call Cupertino their home have been making big screen phones for a while now and they have evolved their designs to the point where there is hardly any bezel on the sides. In contrast, much like their predecessors, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus have very prominent bezels and space both above and below the screen, which translates into a poor screen-to-body ratio for Apple's phones.  We can count on Apple reducing the bezels on the sides of the screen, but making the iPhone shorter while retaining the same display size might prove to be a bigger challenge. The physical Home button - which has evolved over the years to also house the Touch ID fingerprint scanner - has always been the centrepiece of the user interaction paradigm on iOS. Android phones on the other hand can choose to have on-screen buttons, which gives manufacturers more flexibility with their designs. Given how important the Home button is on iOS, it will be interesting to see how Apple goes about making a 5.5-inch screen that's easier to carry around. Since we've been carrying around the new iPhones for over a couple of months, you'd perhaps be curious about the wear and tear visible on the devices. As you can see from the images, there are practically no signs of wear and tear on these phones, even though we've been using them without any sort of a case. Having said that, as someone who treats their gadgets like their first-born, our usage doesn't replicate the real-world experience of most users, and it's safe to assume the wear and tear is no different than what you've experienced on previous iPhone models. The new Pink Rose Gold colour doesn't seem any worse than its older counterparts in this regard. 3D TouchTraditionally, the S series of iPhones are seen as minor upgrades, since they look just like the predecessors. However, the S models have also introduced some marquee features over the years. The iPhone 4S - or iPhone 4s as Apple now wants us to write it - was the first iPhone to ship with Siri, Apple's virtual assistant. The iPhone 5s brought with it the Touch ID, a dual-LED flash, and it was also the first iPhone to ship with a motion co-processor, the M7, and it came with iOS 7, a major overhaul to Apple's mobile OS, though obviously other iOS devices got the update as well. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus continue this tradition by bringing their fair share of improvements. The first new headline feature is 3D Touch, a variant of the Force Touch technology that debuted in the Apple Watch and has since found its way into other devices such as the MacBook as well as accessories. There's been some confusion around what 3D Touch is - a lot has been written about it, yet some continue to think it is nothing but the latest trick from the marketing team at Cupertino in making everyone thing Apple has 'invented' something that exists in every touchscreen phone out there. Not much has changed in the new iPhones as far as the display is concerned While some think 3D Touch is nothing but a long press, in simple terms, it's more of a hard press of the screen. Traditionally, screens have been capable of detecting the point where the user is pressing the display. Then came multi-touch displays that could detect more than one pressure point, making multi-touch gestures like pinch-to-zoom possible. Until now - and this admittedly is an oversimplification of sorts - the pressure sensitivity sensors have been binary in nature - an 'on' state indicating the user is pressing the screen at that point, and an 'off' state indicating an absence of touch. With 3D Touch, this becomes a continuous scale, with the hardware now capable of detecting the amount of pressure you put at each point. Touch-screen devices have traditionally achieved pressure sensitivity by putting this technology in stylus, which can detect how hard you are pressing the stylus against the screen and then pass this information to the software, to take the required action. Admittedly, 3D Touching the display the first few times takes some getting used to, and instances where you fail to trigger it because you didn't put enough force, or just absentmindedly put too much force and accidentally invoked it are common initially. As you would expect, 3D Touch has been made possible by putting a series of sensors underneath the display, increasing the overall weight of the new iPhones as we discussed before. Given what you need to do to trigger the action, the original name - Force Touch - was perhaps more accurate as far as capturing its essence is concerned. The 3D Touch name, however, comes from the pressure sensitivity being sort of a Z axis to the X and Y axis that represent where the user is tapping the screen. Armed with this additional bit of information, software developers can do a whole lot of things that weren't possible earlier. Apple talks about two ways in which applications can use 3D Touch - Quick Actions and Peek & Pop, but that's barely scratching the surface. You can 3D Touch app icons on the home screen to reveal a set of Quick Actions - existing functionality within the app that you can quickly jump to, when you would've traditionally needed to launch the app and then trigger that feature. The default Camera app, for example, lets you quickly jump to selfie mode via 3D Touch, while the Messages app lets you start a conversation with contacts you frequently chat with (in case you are wondering, the contacts in the list are not from your Favourites list, nor are they recent contacts; our guess is they are inspired by Siri Suggestions). Third-party apps need to be updated to add support for these actions, and most of the popular apps have done just that.   You can, for example, quickly resume the podcast you were listening to with Overcast, one of our favourite apps from 2015. Facebook, via Quick Actions, lets you start writing a post or take/ upload a photo or video straight from the home screen. Whether these actions are actually faster than launching the app and switching to that particular option is debatable. That's particularly true with the bigger iPhone 6s Plus, where 3D Touching an icon on parts of the screen that are not easily accessible requires a certain amount of control and precision that one isn't capable of at all times. However, if thoughtfully done, 3D Touch can indeed save you some time and a few taps. Our favourite implementation is perhaps in the Twitterrific app, which lets you quickly switch Twitter accounts, perfect when you spend most of your time using one Twitter account, but want to get something off your chest via another account in a jiffy. In Mail, Messages, and Notes, 3D Touching anywhere on the on-screen keyboard turns it into an onscreen 'trackpad', making it easier to quickly move around the text and make selections. Also, you can 3D Touch the left edge of the display while you are on the home screen to bring up the multitasking view, which is a quieter alternative to doing it by double pressing the home button. Peek and Pop are Apple's implementations for adding 3D Touch related functionality within apps. You can take a peek (aka quick look, not to be confused with Quick Look on OS X) at a mail by 3D touching the List view in the Mail app and let go to get back to the list, potentially saving you the gesture of tapping and then swiping back. If, while taking a peek, you decide you need to respond to this message, you can swipe up to see a list of preset replies. Similarly, you can 3D Touch to preview a link without needing to open it in Safari.  As we mentioned earlier, not only can the sensors on the new iPhones differentiate between 3D Touch and a regular touch, but they can detect everything in between as well. This enables developers to build all kinds of applications that were not possible earlier. Game developers, for example, can now let you choose between gently prying the door open and entering secretly or swinging it wide open by simply detecting the amount of pressure you are putting on the on-screen door. Other great implementations of 3D Touch are coming from third-party developers as well. Magic Piano app, for instance, detects how hard you are pressing down on the virtual keys on screen and adjusts the playback volume accordingly, just like a real piano. Someone even figured out a way to convert your iPhone into a weighing scale, though that's unlikely to find its way into the App Store anytime soon.  One challenge with 3D Touch is that of discoverability. Apart from the icons on the home screen, most 3D Touch actions aren't exactly intuitive, which means you will need to keep randomly 3D Touching at various places to discover new actions - for example multitasking shortcut we mentioned earlier is something you'd either discover by accident or by reading on Apple's website. Even on the home screen, the only way to know which apps support Quick Actions is to 3D Touch them and wait for feedback. Thankfully, the new haptic engine is excellent at giving feedback  on when a 3D Touch action is available and when it isn't. While it's clear that 3D Touch will change the way we interact with apps, in the short term there will be some concerns over usability and discoverability. New Touch IDThe new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus also come with a new, faster Touch ID implementation. As always, Touch ID works great other than on occasions when your fingers are wet, which is expected and and not too much of a bother. Apple says the new Touch IDs are faster than before, and we believe them, because this is perhaps our single biggest problem with the new iPhones - the Touch ID is too damn fast. Until the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, unlocking the iPhone has been a two-stage process, though it usually happens fast enough that most people with Touch ID wouldn't be able to notice the two steps. The first stage involved pressing the home button to wake up the display, and the second is keeping the button pressed to unlock the phone. This two-stage process gave you enough time to wake up the phone's display to, say, check the time or notifications, but let you remove the finger quickly enough that it doesn't unlock the phone. For us - and likely everyone else - this habit has become so ingrained, they wouldn't even realise all this until they switch to the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus. The Touch ID sensor in the new phones is so fast, that the second stage of the process is eliminated. The moment you wake up the phone's display, the phone is unlocked as well, which is infuriating if all you wanted to do is see the time.  We've found ourselves using our knuckles to tap the home button when we want to see the time, which is inconvenient to say the least. Of course a simpler solution would be delete either one of the thumbs or one of our index fingers from Touch ID configuration - yes, we like having all four of them configured - and make that digit the 'designated presser' but that's far from perfect. A simpler way is to press the power button on the side to wake up the display, and it's possible many reading this review are used to doing just that, in which case they must be wondering what we are fussing all about. In our experience, that may be convenient when you already have your hands around the phone, but in all other scenarios - for example when you are taking it out of your pocket or when it's lying next to you - it isn't the most accessible solution. One way Apple can solve this is by adding support for waking up the display by simply double tapping the screen. This is something many big-screen Android phones have done, and it's a feature we find particularly handy. Another way to approach this would be add to the iPhone technology similar to Motorola's Active Display, which provides information like time and notifications automatically on the lock screen, when even the display is powered off. That, of course, would require a switch away from the LCD display that iPhone models have traditionally used, to Amoled display. This is because LCD displays don't let you wake up only parts of the display to show information as needed for Active Display - you need to wake up the entire screen, which means wasting battery life if you are switching on the screen without an explicit command from the user. With Amoled display, you can efficiently wake up only those bits of the screen where you need to show something, so we won't be surprised if Apple makes the switch to Amoled displays as has been rumoured, and brings in Active Display-like technology to make living with faster Touch IDs a whole lot easier.  PerformanceAs you'd expect, the new iPhone models come with beefed up internal specifications as well. There's the new 'desktop class' A9 chip and now 2GB of RAM, a first as far as iPhones are concerned. We've never faced any performance issues on iPhones when they are new, and indeed they tend to age better than their Android counterparts as far as performance is concerned, despite the relatively modest hardware specifications. This of course is down to the fact Apple owns both hardware and software on this side of the smartphone galaxy, which means it can achieve optimisations that are outside the reach of most other manufacturers. The A9 chip is powerful enough that you can edit two 4K streams at once on your iPhone, which is a lot of power to pack in a device that you can carry in your pocket, and something that would've been unthinkable not too long ago. While multitasking in its true sense is limited on iOS, the extra RAM is welcome, especially when you go back to a Safari tab after a while and find it does not need to reload anymore, which is something most longtime iOS users would recognise as a frustration with earlier models. We never really faced any performance issues, though apart from the changes we've documented earlier, there are few real world improvements when compared to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Anyone with an earlier iPhone will definitely notice a sea change, but then you could perhaps say that for anyone moving to a device that's two generations or more newer. We did face one recurring niggle with the iPhone 6s Plus though. Several times, we'd lock our phone in portrait mode only to find the icons in landscape mode when the phone unlocked, and it took 1-2 seconds for the phone to regain its real orientation. iOS 9.2 seemed to fix this, but a few days later the problem reared its ugly head again, albeit we don't experience this behaviour as frequently as we did before.  Did we say earlier our biggest complaint with the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus is that the fingerprint scanner is way too fast? That's because Apple spoilt us by loaning us 128GB iPhone models, when most people will end up buying the 16GB base model. Out of those 16GB, a 12GB is available to users on a brand new phone for storing apps, music, photos, videos, and other data. We don't believe that's enough, especially when you consider the new iPhones can shoot 4K video, which means you can use over 1GB of space by recording just 3 minutes of video by Apple's own estimates. In the two months that we've been using our iPhone 6s Plus, we've captured nearly 8.5GB of photos and videos, and we are nowhere near as prolific in terms of clicking pictures as many people these days. We - and indeed many others - have brought this up with Apple and it's clear the company doesn't believe it's a problem. An Apple representative told Gadgets 360 that customer satisfaction with 16GB iPhone models is extremely high, though he refused to get into the specifics. To its credit, Apple has done a lot to make it easier to live with limited storage with the likes of iCloud Photos, Apple Music, and even making it easier to upgrade to new versions of the OS if your phone is low on storage, a reaction to the problems users faced when upgrading to iOS 8. (Also see: iPhone or iPad Full? Try These 4 Ways to Expand Its Storage) Of course all this means spending a bit more money to get the most out of your phone - Rs. 60 a month to get 50GB space on iCloud to backup those photos automatically, Rs. 120 per month to have access to all the music in the world (well not exactly ""all"", but you get the idea) on demand, and a fast 3G/ 4G connection to make sure all this works when you want it. Apple has even developed a technology called app thinning that makes apps smaller in size, freeing up space on your iOS device for other stuff. All this means it's a little easier to live with a 16GB phone, but we really wish Apple had offered users a bit more breathing room by bumping the base storage to 32GB. (Also see: Now Get 50GB iCloud Storage at Rs. 65 per Month) SoftwareThe new iPhones of course ship with iOS 9, the newest version of Apple's mobile operating system. There are some software features that are tied to the new hardware - like 3D Touch-related tweaks and Live Photos (see below), but for the most part, iOS 9 enhancements are available to older hardware as well, and we've covered them in depth before. We'd still like to highlight a few points we noticed during the considerable time that we spent with the new phones. If you are someone who tried Siri on iPhone 4S and then forgot about it because the performance was fairly hit and miss, then you'd be pleasantly surprised by how far we've come from those days. Siri of course was recently updated to work better with Indian accents, and it can do a lot more as well, although its full potential remains unfulfilled in India and some other regions. We love the ability to ask questions like ""What's the score between Liverpool and Manchester United?"" and ""Who has the most goals for Southampton this season?"" and receiving fast, on-the-spot answers. (Also see: iOS 9 Brings Better Battery Life, Smarter Siri, and More) If you are an Apple Music subscriber - at Rs. 120 per month in India, it's one of the best value deals going around - you can even tell Siri which song (or genre) you are in the mood for, and hear your phone start belting it out in on time. Siri now also works hands free, in that your phone is constantly listening for you to say 'Hey Siri' so it can automatically invoke Siri without you needing to press any buttons. This is similar to the 'Ok Google' functionality on some Android phones.  You can invoke Spotlight by swiping right from the first home screen, and apart from the search box, you will see four contacts and apps listed there. These are not the four most recent apps or contacts; instead Siri is trying to guess the apps you might need or the people you might need to get in touch with. Unfortunately this is definitely not Siri's strongest suit and we can't say we care much for this feature. (Also see: iOS 9 Search Showing Too Many Results? Here's a Simple Fix) If you use Apple's built-in email client, you can enjoy certain other features as well. Many people include their phone number as part of emails they send you. iOS 9 scans this information and the next time this individual calls you, the name of the person who sent the email pops up right next to the number. The first time this happens it's a little freaky as it seems Truecaller's Android avatar has magically installed itself on your phone, but this is definitely a handy feature. Apple of course stresses that all this processing is happening on your device itself and nothing is being sent to the cloud and that no Truecaller-like global registry of numbers is at work here either. Similarly, if emails you receive mention an event like a restaurant confirmation or a flight reservation, iOS 9 can create a suggested event in your calendar. Apple claims to have made some underlying improvements in iOS 9 that offer up to an hour of additional usage time with the device under similar conditions, but we didn't notice any difference when we upgraded our iPhone 6 from iOS 8 to iOS 9, and we didn't spot much of a difference between the battery life of our new iPhone 6s compared to last year's iOS 8-running iPhone 6.  iOS 9 brings a new feature called Wi-Fi Assist that's a boon for those who stream content from wireless drives, as they can now use their phones cellular data to stay connected to the Internet at the same time. Of course it works with other Wi-Fi networks as well. Earlier, if you were on a Wi-Fi network and its Internet connection died or was erratic, you'd have to manually switch off Wi-Fi and move to cellular data. With [Wi-Fi assist] - which is on by default, but can be toggled off - the OS automatically switches to cellular data in case of problems with your Wi-Fi's Internet connection. However, you may end up eating into your cellular bandwidth without realising, so you may want to turn this feature off. (Also see: 20 Awesome Hidden Features of iOS 9) While the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are identical in most respects of software, there's one big difference - just like the previous generation, the bigger iPhone model gets a fully-featured landscape mode, which isn't very common in the smartphone world. Apps like Messages and Mail offer an iPad-like view, making good use of the additional real estate, though the keyboard in landscape-view takes some getting used to. We wish some other tweaks introduced in iOS 9 like the pop-out video player were also available on the bigger iPhone. (Also see: 15 iOS 9 Features That Make Your iPhone and iPad Better Than Ever)  Overall though, iOS 9 is a solid improvement on its predecessor. We won't go into the whole iOS vs. Android debate as we believe both operating systems have now matured to be very similar to each other despite the fundamental differences that set them apart, but we do wish Apple's services worked better in India. Spending over Rs. 50,000 on a phone and finding out it can't prompt you to leave for your meeting because Apple Maps doesn't support directions or traffic updates in India - something even a Rs. 5,000 Android phone can do thanks to Google Now - is extremely frustrating in 2016.  Camera and battery lifeOther than 3D Touch and faster Touch ID, the other big area of improvement in the new iPhone models is the camera. The rear camera has been bumped up to 12 megapixels while the front shooter now comes with a 5-megapixel sensor. The rear camera can now record 4K video, a first for iOS devices, but a few Android devices have been boasting of this capability for a while. Apple says the cameras that the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus ship with are identical, except for the presence of optical image stabilisation (OIS) in the latter. This was the case with the previous generation iPhones as well, though with the latest models, OIS on the Plus now works with videos as well. The headline new feature as far as the cameras in the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are concerned is Live Photos. With Live Photos turned on - toggling it is as easy as switching HDR mode or flash on or off - the phone captures a still photo as usual, but also a small low-resolution video of the moments leading up to and just after the still capture. When you are going through your pictures in the Photos app, Live Photos show up as small animations, and you can 3D Touch the image to see the complete Live Photo, complete with video as well as audio. Under the hood, you will find that every Live Photo is saved as two distinct files - one jpg as usual, and another mov file that was anywhere between 1.5 and 3.5MB in our experience. This means if you are on 16GB phone without iCloud Photos, you may want to keep your Live Photos usage to a minimum. (Also see: iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus: How to Use Live Photos) You can view Live Photos on any iOS device running iOS 9 or any Mac running El Capitan. If you share a Live Photo with, say, an Android user or someone running Windows, it will seem like a regular photo to them, as they will just see the still capture. Live Photos - which, as a concept, isn't too dissimilar to what the likes of BlackBerry and HTC had once offered to their users - give a nice context to every image when you are looking back at your album a few weeks after they were clicked. In our experience, they work best when you are clicking shots of your kids or pets, or other times when those moments leading up to or just after the capture can add a lot of value. Otherwise, in a world where people manufacture moments for the perfect selfie - and Live Photos works with the front camera as well - there may not be many takers for a feature that aims to capture stuff that is a little bit more candid. As far as overall performance of the rear camera is concerned, this might be the first time since the original iPhone came out that Apple doesn't have the phone with the best camera. While the iPhones continue to be a great bet for clicking pictures that accurately captures the colours that we see in everyday life, their performance under less than ideal lighting conditions that most people experience indoors on an everyday basis isn't quite up to the same standard as Samsung's recent flagships. (Sample shot by iPhone 6s Plus (left/ top) and iPhone 6s (right). Tap to see full-sized images) In daylight, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus capture accurate colours and enough detail, but in low-light conditions - where the iPhone 6s Plus fares better than the 6s due to the presence of OIS - the two aren't quite at the same level as the likes of Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and Note 5, which are able to capture more light than any competing smartphone. Having said that, the picture quality is still excellent - especially on the 6s Plus - and most will be more than happy with the results they see on their iPhone. (iPhone 6s Plus sample HDR image. Tap to see in full size.) Apple's camera app makes it dead simple to take panorama shots as well as time-lapse and slo-mo videos, and is perhaps the most user friendly app out there, albeit one that offers few customisations other than exposure control. Pro users wanting a bit more control over their shots are best off downloading a third-party app from the App Store.  With the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, the front camera gets a bump in resolution to 5 megapixels, which is really welcome because the selfie camera on the iPhone was really starting to show its age. The pictures clicked with this are a huge improvement over what we saw with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and there is also one new feature that in our opinion makes this the best selfie-camera out there. The new Retina Flash feature turns the entire display (operating at three times its normal brightness) into a flash you can use while capturing selfies in poor lighting conditions. While the idea isn't exactly new - other manufacturers have experimented with this in the past - Apple has the implementation nailed down perfectly. While we are no fans of using flash while clicking pictures, we realise most phones have it on 'auto' by default, and a majority don't bother changing this settings. Having seen the results with both rear and front flash turned out on the new iPhones, we rest easy knowing that fewer people will be ruining their photos by leaving the flash unnecessarily switched on. (iPhone 6s Plus sample image - tap for full size.) Finally, let's talk about the battery life of the new iPhone models. We got 10 hours and 42 minutes of playback time in our video loop test with the iPhone 6s, which is a marked improvement compared to what we experienced with its predecessor, but the real world usage experience was virtually identical to what we got with the iPhone 6. This is no surprise given that the batteries inside the new iPhone models are only a little bit smaller compared to those powering the previous generation. We got 8 hours and 7 minutes of video playback with the 6s Plus, another reversal of sorts, considering the figure stood at 11 hours and 4 minutes with the iPhone 6 Plus. Once again, our real world experience was pretty much identical between the 6s Plus and the 6 Plus. The smaller iPhone 6s will easily last through a day of moderate usage, but anything more strenuous and you will find yourself reaching for the charger. Despite its higher resolution display, the bigger iPhone 6s Plus will have a little bit left in the tank even at the end of a busy day. VerdictWhile this review may have been slightly different, we must answer the same old question - should you consider buying the new iPhone models? First, let's compare the two phones themselves. While the iPhone 6s Plus is rather ungainly to use on an everyday basis, its better camera and battery life make it Apple's 'real' flagship phone that we feel people should consider getting. You would probably want to get the 64GB version, which means you are looking at spending Rs. 82,000 in India, notwithstanding the recent discounts. Let's face it - that's a lot of money to be spending on a phone, which will be outdated in a few months when the newer, shinier models come out. The one saving grace is that, recent developments notwithstanding, the iPhones - and indeed most of Apple hardware - tend to hold their value better than their competitors, and if you take good care of your phones, you can recover a substantial chunk of that money 12 months down the line. Indeed, resale sites offer up to Rs. 30,000 for your 16GB iPhone 6 as long as it's in excellent condition and you have its box and all its accessories, which is more than what some new Android flagships and 'flagship killers' retail for, making it easier to upgrade when a new model comes out. With Live Photos, improved camera performance, and faster touch ID are nice - the latter being annoying as well - 3D Touch is perhaps the biggest improvement in the new iPhone models, and one that will definitely find its way to more phones in the future, and not just ones made by Apple. However, it will be a while before developers are ready to make full use of its potential, which means if you already have an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus, you can perhaps skip this 'S' generation. For anyone with an older iPhone, the upgrade is definitely big enough to be compelling, though the prospect of a radical new design with the next generation of iPhones is something one must always contend with while making a buying decision at this time. If you are platform agnostic, you could buy any one of Samsung's recent phones - the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6 Edge+, Galaxy Note 5 - and rest easy knowing you have a phone that's as good as Apple's newest flagships with a camera that performs better in low light conditions, saving a big chunk of cash along the way. The Edge series of smartphones also feature a striking new design, words we didn't think we would ourselves saying when talking about a Samsung phone 18 months ago. Of course some believe that the days of expensive flagship smartphones themselves are numbered, and no one should be spending more than Rs. 20,000 (if that) on a phone anymore. While there's some merit to that statement, we believe the top level of smartphones - and perhaps only the likes of Apple and Samsung's flagships belong at that level anymore - still manage to differentiate themselves from the crowd. Whether that difference is worth a significant premium is something that we will see play out in 2016."
1058,21,iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-review-786021,8,10,2016-06-15,786021,Kunal Dua,iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/iphone-6s-and-iphone-6s-plus-review-786021," For most of the reviews here at Gadgets 360, we use the mobile in question as our primary phone for about a week or so before sharing our verdict with you. We realise this isn't perfect, since there are some aspects of the device that don't become obvious during that time, and in an ideal world, we'd use every phone for a couple of months before we publish our review. But we work under constraints where most devices aren't available to us for that long - almost all products that we review are loaned to us by companies for short durations - and there's also the competitive pressure of wanting to get your review out before others do, as long as it doesn't involve cutting any corners. With the launch of iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus in India, Apple offered to loan the two new iPhones to Gadgets 360 - and indeed other publications - for more than the typical timeframe of a few days. The India iPhone launch of course came a few weeks after it was available in the US and several other countries, which meant that there were enough reviews out there for us not to worry about timelines too much. This gave us an ideal opportunity to spend more time than we'd initially imagined with the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus and share our thoughts two months into using them.  The extra time also gave us more time to think about the development of the iPhone line in the future, and tie that in with information that has come to light in the recent weeks. Strap yourselves in, because you are in for a long ride. Look and feelWe were using the iPhone 6 as our primary phone before our rather lengthy experiment for the sake of this review, and we remember that the iPhone 6s felt noticeably heavier when we first picked it up, and this difference really threw us off our game for the first 24 hours. We imagine the experience would be pretty much the same if you switched from an iPhone 6 Plus to an iPhone 6s Plus. For a company that's obsessed with making its products thinner and lighter, shipping flagship products that are both heavier and thicker than their predecessors is an interesting decision, and one that may not have been taken lightly at Cupertino.  We understand the new 3D Touch sensors are to be blamed for the extra weight, but in the absence of any official information from Apple, it's difficult to be certain. A couple of days into the review process, however, we'd gotten used to the new weight of the phone, and this is where we hope against hope that Apple takes a lesson when designing future iPhone models. The lesson of course is that people aren't as obsessed with 'thin and light' as the product designers at Cupertino, and they can get used to a little bit of extra weight pretty quickly. So dear Apple designers, when you figure out how to make the 3D Touch panels thinner and lighter, can you fill that remaining space with a bigger battery? We won't complain, we promise. We wouldn't hold our breath on Apple actually listening to that feedback, but that doesn't mean we stop trying, right? It seems as if every iPhone is greeted by a controversy that rears its head around launch time and before you realise, it has taken on a life of its own. If it was iPhone 4 and Antennagate - a problem that was as real as physics itself - then in 2014 we had one-part truth, one-part fiction, and all-parts YouTube sensation called Bendgate. The iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, as you may remember, were shown to be prone to bending if you, well, tried to bend them with a great amount of force (what a surprise). The topic eventually died down, but one wonders if reverberations of the controversy are being seen in the build of the newest iPhone models. While there was no mention of Bendgate when Apple launched the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, our thoughts went back to last year's controversy when Apple announced that the new iPhone models are made out of 7000 series aluminium alloy, a grade of metal that's also used in the aerospace industry. Sceptics may see this as an acknowledgement that Bendgate was real, while others may see it as a natural design evolution. The iPhone 6s Plus comes with a 5.5-inch display but in terms of overall size it rivals some 6-inch devices in the Android world. This is something we had criticised during our review of the iPhone 6 Plus last year, and since we are on an 'S' cycle, we didn't expect it to change this year. Manufacturers who don't call Cupertino their home have been making big screen phones for a while now and they have evolved their designs to the point where there is hardly any bezel on the sides. In contrast, much like their predecessors, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus have very prominent bezels and space both above and below the screen, which translates into a poor screen-to-body ratio for Apple's phones.  We can count on Apple reducing the bezels on the sides of the screen, but making the iPhone shorter while retaining the same display size might prove to be a bigger challenge. The physical Home button - which has evolved over the years to also house the Touch ID fingerprint scanner - has always been the centrepiece of the user interaction paradigm on iOS. Android phones on the other hand can choose to have on-screen buttons, which gives manufacturers more flexibility with their designs. Given how important the Home button is on iOS, it will be interesting to see how Apple goes about making a 5.5-inch screen that's easier to carry around. Since we've been carrying around the new iPhones for over a couple of months, you'd perhaps be curious about the wear and tear visible on the devices. As you can see from the images, there are practically no signs of wear and tear on these phones, even though we've been using them without any sort of a case. Having said that, as someone who treats their gadgets like their first-born, our usage doesn't replicate the real-world experience of most users, and it's safe to assume the wear and tear is no different than what you've experienced on previous iPhone models. The new Pink Rose Gold colour doesn't seem any worse than its older counterparts in this regard. 3D TouchTraditionally, the S series of iPhones are seen as minor upgrades, since they look just like the predecessors. However, the S models have also introduced some marquee features over the years. The iPhone 4S - or iPhone 4s as Apple now wants us to write it - was the first iPhone to ship with Siri, Apple's virtual assistant. The iPhone 5s brought with it the Touch ID, a dual-LED flash, and it was also the first iPhone to ship with a motion co-processor, the M7, and it came with iOS 7, a major overhaul to Apple's mobile OS, though obviously other iOS devices got the update as well. The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus continue this tradition by bringing their fair share of improvements. The first new headline feature is 3D Touch, a variant of the Force Touch technology that debuted in the Apple Watch and has since found its way into other devices such as the MacBook as well as accessories. There's been some confusion around what 3D Touch is - a lot has been written about it, yet some continue to think it is nothing but the latest trick from the marketing team at Cupertino in making everyone thing Apple has 'invented' something that exists in every touchscreen phone out there. Not much has changed in the new iPhones as far as the display is concerned While some think 3D Touch is nothing but a long press, in simple terms, it's more of a hard press of the screen. Traditionally, screens have been capable of detecting the point where the user is pressing the display. Then came multi-touch displays that could detect more than one pressure point, making multi-touch gestures like pinch-to-zoom possible. Until now - and this admittedly is an oversimplification of sorts - the pressure sensitivity sensors have been binary in nature - an 'on' state indicating the user is pressing the screen at that point, and an 'off' state indicating an absence of touch. With 3D Touch, this becomes a continuous scale, with the hardware now capable of detecting the amount of pressure you put at each point. Touch-screen devices have traditionally achieved pressure sensitivity by putting this technology in stylus, which can detect how hard you are pressing the stylus against the screen and then pass this information to the software, to take the required action. Admittedly, 3D Touching the display the first few times takes some getting used to, and instances where you fail to trigger it because you didn't put enough force, or just absentmindedly put too much force and accidentally invoked it are common initially. As you would expect, 3D Touch has been made possible by putting a series of sensors underneath the display, increasing the overall weight of the new iPhones as we discussed before. Given what you need to do to trigger the action, the original name - Force Touch - was perhaps more accurate as far as capturing its essence is concerned. The 3D Touch name, however, comes from the pressure sensitivity being sort of a Z axis to the X and Y axis that represent where the user is tapping the screen. Armed with this additional bit of information, software developers can do a whole lot of things that weren't possible earlier. Apple talks about two ways in which applications can use 3D Touch - Quick Actions and Peek & Pop, but that's barely scratching the surface. You can 3D Touch app icons on the home screen to reveal a set of Quick Actions - existing functionality within the app that you can quickly jump to, when you would've traditionally needed to launch the app and then trigger that feature. The default Camera app, for example, lets you quickly jump to selfie mode via 3D Touch, while the Messages app lets you start a conversation with contacts you frequently chat with (in case you are wondering, the contacts in the list are not from your Favourites list, nor are they recent contacts; our guess is they are inspired by Siri Suggestions). Third-party apps need to be updated to add support for these actions, and most of the popular apps have done just that.   You can, for example, quickly resume the podcast you were listening to with Overcast, one of our favourite apps from 2015. Facebook, via Quick Actions, lets you start writing a post or take/ upload a photo or video straight from the home screen. Whether these actions are actually faster than launching the app and switching to that particular option is debatable. That's particularly true with the bigger iPhone 6s Plus, where 3D Touching an icon on parts of the screen that are not easily accessible requires a certain amount of control and precision that one isn't capable of at all times. However, if thoughtfully done, 3D Touch can indeed save you some time and a few taps. Our favourite implementation is perhaps in the Twitterrific app, which lets you quickly switch Twitter accounts, perfect when you spend most of your time using one Twitter account, but want to get something off your chest via another account in a jiffy. In Mail, Messages, and Notes, 3D Touching anywhere on the on-screen keyboard turns it into an onscreen 'trackpad', making it easier to quickly move around the text and make selections. Also, you can 3D Touch the left edge of the display while you are on the home screen to bring up the multitasking view, which is a quieter alternative to doing it by double pressing the home button. Peek and Pop are Apple's implementations for adding 3D Touch related functionality within apps. You can take a peek (aka quick look, not to be confused with Quick Look on OS X) at a mail by 3D touching the List view in the Mail app and let go to get back to the list, potentially saving you the gesture of tapping and then swiping back. If, while taking a peek, you decide you need to respond to this message, you can swipe up to see a list of preset replies. Similarly, you can 3D Touch to preview a link without needing to open it in Safari.  As we mentioned earlier, not only can the sensors on the new iPhones differentiate between 3D Touch and a regular touch, but they can detect everything in between as well. This enables developers to build all kinds of applications that were not possible earlier. Game developers, for example, can now let you choose between gently prying the door open and entering secretly or swinging it wide open by simply detecting the amount of pressure you are putting on the on-screen door. Other great implementations of 3D Touch are coming from third-party developers as well. Magic Piano app, for instance, detects how hard you are pressing down on the virtual keys on screen and adjusts the playback volume accordingly, just like a real piano. Someone even figured out a way to convert your iPhone into a weighing scale, though that's unlikely to find its way into the App Store anytime soon.  One challenge with 3D Touch is that of discoverability. Apart from the icons on the home screen, most 3D Touch actions aren't exactly intuitive, which means you will need to keep randomly 3D Touching at various places to discover new actions - for example multitasking shortcut we mentioned earlier is something you'd either discover by accident or by reading on Apple's website. Even on the home screen, the only way to know which apps support Quick Actions is to 3D Touch them and wait for feedback. Thankfully, the new haptic engine is excellent at giving feedback  on when a 3D Touch action is available and when it isn't. While it's clear that 3D Touch will change the way we interact with apps, in the short term there will be some concerns over usability and discoverability. New Touch IDThe new iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus also come with a new, faster Touch ID implementation. As always, Touch ID works great other than on occasions when your fingers are wet, which is expected and and not too much of a bother. Apple says the new Touch IDs are faster than before, and we believe them, because this is perhaps our single biggest problem with the new iPhones - the Touch ID is too damn fast. Until the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, unlocking the iPhone has been a two-stage process, though it usually happens fast enough that most people with Touch ID wouldn't be able to notice the two steps. The first stage involved pressing the home button to wake up the display, and the second is keeping the button pressed to unlock the phone. This two-stage process gave you enough time to wake up the phone's display to, say, check the time or notifications, but let you remove the finger quickly enough that it doesn't unlock the phone. For us - and likely everyone else - this habit has become so ingrained, they wouldn't even realise all this until they switch to the iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus. The Touch ID sensor in the new phones is so fast, that the second stage of the process is eliminated. The moment you wake up the phone's display, the phone is unlocked as well, which is infuriating if all you wanted to do is see the time.  We've found ourselves using our knuckles to tap the home button when we want to see the time, which is inconvenient to say the least. Of course a simpler solution would be delete either one of the thumbs or one of our index fingers from Touch ID configuration - yes, we like having all four of them configured - and make that digit the 'designated presser' but that's far from perfect. A simpler way is to press the power button on the side to wake up the display, and it's possible many reading this review are used to doing just that, in which case they must be wondering what we are fussing all about. In our experience, that may be convenient when you already have your hands around the phone, but in all other scenarios - for example when you are taking it out of your pocket or when it's lying next to you - it isn't the most accessible solution. One way Apple can solve this is by adding support for waking up the display by simply double tapping the screen. This is something many big-screen Android phones have done, and it's a feature we find particularly handy. Another way to approach this would be add to the iPhone technology similar to Motorola's Active Display, which provides information like time and notifications automatically on the lock screen, when even the display is powered off. That, of course, would require a switch away from the LCD display that iPhone models have traditionally used, to Amoled display. This is because LCD displays don't let you wake up only parts of the display to show information as needed for Active Display - you need to wake up the entire screen, which means wasting battery life if you are switching on the screen without an explicit command from the user. With Amoled display, you can efficiently wake up only those bits of the screen where you need to show something, so we won't be surprised if Apple makes the switch to Amoled displays as has been rumoured, and brings in Active Display-like technology to make living with faster Touch IDs a whole lot easier.  PerformanceAs you'd expect, the new iPhone models come with beefed up internal specifications as well. There's the new 'desktop class' A9 chip and now 2GB of RAM, a first as far as iPhones are concerned. We've never faced any performance issues on iPhones when they are new, and indeed they tend to age better than their Android counterparts as far as performance is concerned, despite the relatively modest hardware specifications. This of course is down to the fact Apple owns both hardware and software on this side of the smartphone galaxy, which means it can achieve optimisations that are outside the reach of most other manufacturers. The A9 chip is powerful enough that you can edit two 4K streams at once on your iPhone, which is a lot of power to pack in a device that you can carry in your pocket, and something that would've been unthinkable not too long ago. While multitasking in its true sense is limited on iOS, the extra RAM is welcome, especially when you go back to a Safari tab after a while and find it does not need to reload anymore, which is something most longtime iOS users would recognise as a frustration with earlier models. We never really faced any performance issues, though apart from the changes we've documented earlier, there are few real world improvements when compared to the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Anyone with an earlier iPhone will definitely notice a sea change, but then you could perhaps say that for anyone moving to a device that's two generations or more newer. We did face one recurring niggle with the iPhone 6s Plus though. Several times, we'd lock our phone in portrait mode only to find the icons in landscape mode when the phone unlocked, and it took 1-2 seconds for the phone to regain its real orientation. iOS 9.2 seemed to fix this, but a few days later the problem reared its ugly head again, albeit we don't experience this behaviour as frequently as we did before.  Did we say earlier our biggest complaint with the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus is that the fingerprint scanner is way too fast? That's because Apple spoilt us by loaning us 128GB iPhone models, when most people will end up buying the 16GB base model. Out of those 16GB, a 12GB is available to users on a brand new phone for storing apps, music, photos, videos, and other data. We don't believe that's enough, especially when you consider the new iPhones can shoot 4K video, which means you can use over 1GB of space by recording just 3 minutes of video by Apple's own estimates. In the two months that we've been using our iPhone 6s Plus, we've captured nearly 8.5GB of photos and videos, and we are nowhere near as prolific in terms of clicking pictures as many people these days. We - and indeed many others - have brought this up with Apple and it's clear the company doesn't believe it's a problem. An Apple representative told Gadgets 360 that customer satisfaction with 16GB iPhone models is extremely high, though he refused to get into the specifics. To its credit, Apple has done a lot to make it easier to live with limited storage with the likes of iCloud Photos, Apple Music, and even making it easier to upgrade to new versions of the OS if your phone is low on storage, a reaction to the problems users faced when upgrading to iOS 8. (Also see: iPhone or iPad Full? Try These 4 Ways to Expand Its Storage) Of course all this means spending a bit more money to get the most out of your phone - Rs. 60 a month to get 50GB space on iCloud to backup those photos automatically, Rs. 120 per month to have access to all the music in the world (well not exactly ""all"", but you get the idea) on demand, and a fast 3G/ 4G connection to make sure all this works when you want it. Apple has even developed a technology called app thinning that makes apps smaller in size, freeing up space on your iOS device for other stuff. All this means it's a little easier to live with a 16GB phone, but we really wish Apple had offered users a bit more breathing room by bumping the base storage to 32GB. (Also see: Now Get 50GB iCloud Storage at Rs. 65 per Month) SoftwareThe new iPhones of course ship with iOS 9, the newest version of Apple's mobile operating system. There are some software features that are tied to the new hardware - like 3D Touch-related tweaks and Live Photos (see below), but for the most part, iOS 9 enhancements are available to older hardware as well, and we've covered them in depth before. We'd still like to highlight a few points we noticed during the considerable time that we spent with the new phones. If you are someone who tried Siri on iPhone 4S and then forgot about it because the performance was fairly hit and miss, then you'd be pleasantly surprised by how far we've come from those days. Siri of course was recently updated to work better with Indian accents, and it can do a lot more as well, although its full potential remains unfulfilled in India and some other regions. We love the ability to ask questions like ""What's the score between Liverpool and Manchester United?"" and ""Who has the most goals for Southampton this season?"" and receiving fast, on-the-spot answers. (Also see: iOS 9 Brings Better Battery Life, Smarter Siri, and More) If you are an Apple Music subscriber - at Rs. 120 per month in India, it's one of the best value deals going around - you can even tell Siri which song (or genre) you are in the mood for, and hear your phone start belting it out in on time. Siri now also works hands free, in that your phone is constantly listening for you to say 'Hey Siri' so it can automatically invoke Siri without you needing to press any buttons. This is similar to the 'Ok Google' functionality on some Android phones.  You can invoke Spotlight by swiping right from the first home screen, and apart from the search box, you will see four contacts and apps listed there. These are not the four most recent apps or contacts; instead Siri is trying to guess the apps you might need or the people you might need to get in touch with. Unfortunately this is definitely not Siri's strongest suit and we can't say we care much for this feature. (Also see: iOS 9 Search Showing Too Many Results? Here's a Simple Fix) If you use Apple's built-in email client, you can enjoy certain other features as well. Many people include their phone number as part of emails they send you. iOS 9 scans this information and the next time this individual calls you, the name of the person who sent the email pops up right next to the number. The first time this happens it's a little freaky as it seems Truecaller's Android avatar has magically installed itself on your phone, but this is definitely a handy feature. Apple of course stresses that all this processing is happening on your device itself and nothing is being sent to the cloud and that no Truecaller-like global registry of numbers is at work here either. Similarly, if emails you receive mention an event like a restaurant confirmation or a flight reservation, iOS 9 can create a suggested event in your calendar. Apple claims to have made some underlying improvements in iOS 9 that offer up to an hour of additional usage time with the device under similar conditions, but we didn't notice any difference when we upgraded our iPhone 6 from iOS 8 to iOS 9, and we didn't spot much of a difference between the battery life of our new iPhone 6s compared to last year's iOS 8-running iPhone 6.  iOS 9 brings a new feature called Wi-Fi Assist that's a boon for those who stream content from wireless drives, as they can now use their phones cellular data to stay connected to the Internet at the same time. Of course it works with other Wi-Fi networks as well. Earlier, if you were on a Wi-Fi network and its Internet connection died or was erratic, you'd have to manually switch off Wi-Fi and move to cellular data. With [Wi-Fi assist] - which is on by default, but can be toggled off - the OS automatically switches to cellular data in case of problems with your Wi-Fi's Internet connection. However, you may end up eating into your cellular bandwidth without realising, so you may want to turn this feature off. (Also see: 20 Awesome Hidden Features of iOS 9) While the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are identical in most respects of software, there's one big difference - just like the previous generation, the bigger iPhone model gets a fully-featured landscape mode, which isn't very common in the smartphone world. Apps like Messages and Mail offer an iPad-like view, making good use of the additional real estate, though the keyboard in landscape-view takes some getting used to. We wish some other tweaks introduced in iOS 9 like the pop-out video player were also available on the bigger iPhone. (Also see: 15 iOS 9 Features That Make Your iPhone and iPad Better Than Ever)  Overall though, iOS 9 is a solid improvement on its predecessor. We won't go into the whole iOS vs. Android debate as we believe both operating systems have now matured to be very similar to each other despite the fundamental differences that set them apart, but we do wish Apple's services worked better in India. Spending over Rs. 50,000 on a phone and finding out it can't prompt you to leave for your meeting because Apple Maps doesn't support directions or traffic updates in India - something even a Rs. 5,000 Android phone can do thanks to Google Now - is extremely frustrating in 2016.  Camera and battery lifeOther than 3D Touch and faster Touch ID, the other big area of improvement in the new iPhone models is the camera. The rear camera has been bumped up to 12 megapixels while the front shooter now comes with a 5-megapixel sensor. The rear camera can now record 4K video, a first for iOS devices, but a few Android devices have been boasting of this capability for a while. Apple says the cameras that the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus ship with are identical, except for the presence of optical image stabilisation (OIS) in the latter. This was the case with the previous generation iPhones as well, though with the latest models, OIS on the Plus now works with videos as well. The headline new feature as far as the cameras in the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus are concerned is Live Photos. With Live Photos turned on - toggling it is as easy as switching HDR mode or flash on or off - the phone captures a still photo as usual, but also a small low-resolution video of the moments leading up to and just after the still capture. When you are going through your pictures in the Photos app, Live Photos show up as small animations, and you can 3D Touch the image to see the complete Live Photo, complete with video as well as audio. Under the hood, you will find that every Live Photo is saved as two distinct files - one jpg as usual, and another mov file that was anywhere between 1.5 and 3.5MB in our experience. This means if you are on 16GB phone without iCloud Photos, you may want to keep your Live Photos usage to a minimum. (Also see: iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus: How to Use Live Photos) You can view Live Photos on any iOS device running iOS 9 or any Mac running El Capitan. If you share a Live Photo with, say, an Android user or someone running Windows, it will seem like a regular photo to them, as they will just see the still capture. Live Photos - which, as a concept, isn't too dissimilar to what the likes of BlackBerry and HTC had once offered to their users - give a nice context to every image when you are looking back at your album a few weeks after they were clicked. In our experience, they work best when you are clicking shots of your kids or pets, or other times when those moments leading up to or just after the capture can add a lot of value. Otherwise, in a world where people manufacture moments for the perfect selfie - and Live Photos works with the front camera as well - there may not be many takers for a feature that aims to capture stuff that is a little bit more candid. As far as overall performance of the rear camera is concerned, this might be the first time since the original iPhone came out that Apple doesn't have the phone with the best camera. While the iPhones continue to be a great bet for clicking pictures that accurately captures the colours that we see in everyday life, their performance under less than ideal lighting conditions that most people experience indoors on an everyday basis isn't quite up to the same standard as Samsung's recent flagships. (Sample shot by iPhone 6s Plus (left/ top) and iPhone 6s (right). Tap to see full-sized images) In daylight, the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus capture accurate colours and enough detail, but in low-light conditions - where the iPhone 6s Plus fares better than the 6s due to the presence of OIS - the two aren't quite at the same level as the likes of Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge and Note 5, which are able to capture more light than any competing smartphone. Having said that, the picture quality is still excellent - especially on the 6s Plus - and most will be more than happy with the results they see on their iPhone. (iPhone 6s Plus sample HDR image. Tap to see in full size.) Apple's camera app makes it dead simple to take panorama shots as well as time-lapse and slo-mo videos, and is perhaps the most user friendly app out there, albeit one that offers few customisations other than exposure control. Pro users wanting a bit more control over their shots are best off downloading a third-party app from the App Store.  With the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, the front camera gets a bump in resolution to 5 megapixels, which is really welcome because the selfie camera on the iPhone was really starting to show its age. The pictures clicked with this are a huge improvement over what we saw with the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus, and there is also one new feature that in our opinion makes this the best selfie-camera out there. The new Retina Flash feature turns the entire display (operating at three times its normal brightness) into a flash you can use while capturing selfies in poor lighting conditions. While the idea isn't exactly new - other manufacturers have experimented with this in the past - Apple has the implementation nailed down perfectly. While we are no fans of using flash while clicking pictures, we realise most phones have it on 'auto' by default, and a majority don't bother changing this settings. Having seen the results with both rear and front flash turned out on the new iPhones, we rest easy knowing that fewer people will be ruining their photos by leaving the flash unnecessarily switched on. (iPhone 6s Plus sample image - tap for full size.) Finally, let's talk about the battery life of the new iPhone models. We got 10 hours and 42 minutes of playback time in our video loop test with the iPhone 6s, which is a marked improvement compared to what we experienced with its predecessor, but the real world usage experience was virtually identical to what we got with the iPhone 6. This is no surprise given that the batteries inside the new iPhone models are only a little bit smaller compared to those powering the previous generation. We got 8 hours and 7 minutes of video playback with the 6s Plus, another reversal of sorts, considering the figure stood at 11 hours and 4 minutes with the iPhone 6 Plus. Once again, our real world experience was pretty much identical between the 6s Plus and the 6 Plus. The smaller iPhone 6s will easily last through a day of moderate usage, but anything more strenuous and you will find yourself reaching for the charger. Despite its higher resolution display, the bigger iPhone 6s Plus will have a little bit left in the tank even at the end of a busy day. VerdictWhile this review may have been slightly different, we must answer the same old question - should you consider buying the new iPhone models? First, let's compare the two phones themselves. While the iPhone 6s Plus is rather ungainly to use on an everyday basis, its better camera and battery life make it Apple's 'real' flagship phone that we feel people should consider getting. You would probably want to get the 64GB version, which means you are looking at spending Rs. 82,000 in India, notwithstanding the recent discounts. Let's face it - that's a lot of money to be spending on a phone, which will be outdated in a few months when the newer, shinier models come out. The one saving grace is that, recent developments notwithstanding, the iPhones - and indeed most of Apple hardware - tend to hold their value better than their competitors, and if you take good care of your phones, you can recover a substantial chunk of that money 12 months down the line. Indeed, resale sites offer up to Rs. 30,000 for your 16GB iPhone 6 as long as it's in excellent condition and you have its box and all its accessories, which is more than what some new Android flagships and 'flagship killers' retail for, making it easier to upgrade when a new model comes out. With Live Photos, improved camera performance, and faster touch ID are nice - the latter being annoying as well - 3D Touch is perhaps the biggest improvement in the new iPhone models, and one that will definitely find its way to more phones in the future, and not just ones made by Apple. However, it will be a while before developers are ready to make full use of its potential, which means if you already have an iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 Plus, you can perhaps skip this 'S' generation. For anyone with an older iPhone, the upgrade is definitely big enough to be compelling, though the prospect of a radical new design with the next generation of iPhones is something one must always contend with while making a buying decision at this time. If you are platform agnostic, you could buy any one of Samsung's recent phones - the Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy S6 Edge+, Galaxy Note 5 - and rest easy knowing you have a phone that's as good as Apple's newest flagships with a camera that performs better in low light conditions, saving a big chunk of cash along the way. The Edge series of smartphones also feature a striking new design, words we didn't think we would ourselves saying when talking about a Samsung phone 18 months ago. Of course some believe that the days of expensive flagship smartphones themselves are numbered, and no one should be spending more than Rs. 20,000 (if that) on a phone anymore. While there's some merit to that statement, we believe the top level of smartphones - and perhaps only the likes of Apple and Samsung's flagships belong at that level anymore - still manage to differentiate themselves from the crowd. Whether that difference is worth a significant premium is something that we will see play out in 2016."
1720,21,iphone-7-and-iphone-7-plus-review-1643412,9,10,2016-12-30,1643412,Kunal Dua,iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/iphone-7-and-iphone-7-plus-review-1643412," The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launch this September represented a departure from tradition for Apple - and in many ways, a risk. Instead of the usual tick-tock cycle where each ’S’ release is followed by a brand-new design, the new iPhone models look pretty similar to their counterparts from the previous two years, and sport nearly identical dimensions. There are more changes than there are in a typical ‘S’ cycle, but if you have a Rose Gold iPhone 6s or a Silver iPhone 6 Plus, for example, the differences may not be apparent at first glance. In a world in which a device’s reception is driven by its looks, it was no surprise that the initial reaction to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus was lukewarm. Apple didn’t help matters with the ""courageous"" move of dropping the headphone port, with everyone and their friend Jack outraged even before anyone had a chance to test the impact of the move in the real world. So how do the new iPhone models stack up against their predecessors and competing flagships from the Android world? Like last year, we’ve spent more time than we do with most phones before sharing our thoughts with you, and here’s our review of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus designAs we mentioned earlier, the new iPhone models can easily be mistaken for their predecessors at first glance. The most visible change is that two of the antenna lines that marred the otherwise beautiful design of the previous iPhone models have been removed. The ones that remain are flush with the top and bottom edges, making them a lot less prominent than before; in fact, on the Black and Jet Black variants they are all but invisible. Which brings us to another break from tradition - the launch of not one, but two new colours. Gone is our previous favourite Space Grey, replaced with two great new options – Black, and the rather imaginatively named Jet Black. While the former has the same classy, understated matte finish as before, the latter features a glossy finish that makes it a bit of fingerprint magnet. Jet Black iPhone 7 This year, we received a Black iPhone 7 Plus and a Jet Black iPhone 7 as our review units. We spent our initial days alternating between using the two as our primary phones, before we ultimately settled on the iPhone 7. This was down to two reasons. First, the Jet Black finish itself. As we stated in our Sony Xperia XZ review, the Jet Black finish gives the best in-hand feel we’ve experienced with a mobile device. The finish has just the right balance between grip and smoothness. In comparison, the Black finish on our iPhone 7 Plus felt a bit too boring. Of course as someone who’s looking to buy a new phone, you can get the Jet Black finish in both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, so this won’t be a factor for you. Second, as we will discuss through the course of the review, the differences in performance and features between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus isn’t the same as between iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, so apart from the slightly cramped typing experience (we were using the iPhone 6s Plus as our primary device before), we didn’t feel like we were ‘settling’ for the smaller iPhone. Now we admit part of the appeal of the iPhone 7 could be our nostalgia for smaller phones in a world where every other new release seems to be pushing the envelope on how big a phone can get. Back to the Jet Black finish, and fingerprints are not the only thing it attracts - as Apple itself points out on its website, the new finish is more scratch-prone than others. Since we love the finish so much, and have never been fans of cases, we used the iPhone 7 without any protection for the duration of our testing, and for most of this time we couldn’t see what the fuss was about. Despite using it as our primary device for over two months, we didn’t notice any scratches on our Jet Black iPhone 7 - until we saw our unit under a particular light and then dozens of tiny scratches at the back suddenly became visible! Thankfully, this wasn’t a case of not being able to un-see something after having seen it. We went back to business without really being bothered, but if you are someone who worries about the resale value of your phone, this is something you might need to keep in mind. Typing on the iPhone 7 felt just a little bit cramped iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus displayHave you ever ordered something online only to find that the colours don’t quite match what you saw on your screen when it arrives? Don’t blame the store, blame the limitations of technology. Not many realise this, but the colours that you see on screen - whether it’s your mobile, laptop, or any other device - are only a visual approximation of real colours. In fact, no electronic device is capable of accurately representing the entire range of colours that occur naturally. Every display and even devices like cameras, which are used to capture colour information, have an associated colour profile that defines the range of colours (aka colour space) that they can display or capture. To ensure interoperability across devices, colour profiles have been standardised, and the most popular one is called sRGB. This is used by most displays (computer and mobile), cameras, printers, and other devices. Let’s take the example of an image where you have multiple shades of red - for example a gradient that goes from an extremely dark shade of red to the lightest possible red. While in the real world you will see this as a continuous stream of colour with virtually infinite strains of red in between, while capturing this information, your sRGB camera is limited by the number of red shades available in its colour space. This means that every pixel that doesn’t have a corresponding exact match in the sRGB colour gamut is replaced by its closest match. This is the main reason why gradients never look as smooth on our screens as they do in the real world. Like we mentioned earlier, we haven’t been able to make devices that accurately capture 100 percent of the colour information available in the real world, but there are devices that can capture more colour information than the sRGB colour space, minimising the inaccuracies introduced by digitisation. One such colour space is the DCI-P3 colour space that has a 25 percent larger colour gamut than sRGB, which means the approximation of colours that it offers is closer to the real world than what you get with standard sRGB devices. Now it’s important to understand that just having a display that supports the wide-colour gamut doesn’t mean you will see images and colours that are closer to the real world - the picture that you are seeing should’ve been captured using the wide colour profile to begin with. If your camera or scanner approximated the colours down to the sRGB colour space while capturing the image, there’s nothing your fancy wide display can do to offer a better viewing experience.  This long-winded explanation is a precursor to tell you that while the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have wide colour gamut displays (as Apple calls them), it doesn’t really make much of a difference in most day-to-day situations since most visual information is still being captured in the sRGB colour space. This means that most of the time the P3-capable displays are rendering a sRGB image, and it’s no surprise then that they look pretty similar to other displays. Even when you are viewing content that’s captured using the DCP-P3 colour space, you may not really notice the differences on the relatively small smartphone screen. This is further compounded by the fact that every smartphone out there uses colour matching techniques to display DCI-P3 content on its sRGB display, and every panel manufacturer may use a different algorithm to approximate the colours. Thrown in the differences in luminance, saturation, and other factors across screens, and there’s no saying which display will look the most ‘appealing’ to the naked eye. But Apple’s switch to the P3 colour space is about accurate colour reproduction and not how good the images look, and on that count the display on the iPhone 7 is said to be ""virtually indistinguishable from perfect"". As you would expect, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus’s cameras are capable of capturing information in the P3 space. While the new iPhone models as well as the latest MacBook Pro and iMac models will show these colours off in all their glory, you may not see them the same way while using any other phone or computer, unless of course your device is also listed to support the P3 colour space, like the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. To be fair, these inaccuracies are unlikely to bother the Average Joe using any other smartphone, but purists can rejoice in the knowledge that the iPhone 7 can now accurately display 4K content that’s captured in the DCI-P3 colour space, just like many expensive new television sets. The displays on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus continue to way behind the competition when it comes to resolution and pixels per inch, but this hasn’t bothered us in the past, and using the new models was no different. Text still appears sharp, and pixelation was never a problem. The new displays are rated to be 625 nits bright, compared to 500 nits each in the earlier models; a difference that’s clearly visible when you, say, put the iPhone 7 Plus next to an iPhone 6s Plus. Suffice to say the displays on the new iPhone models are bright enough for any situation.  iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus performance and battery lifeThe iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus famously do away with a physical home button. Instead of a button that moves when pressed, you have a static, solid-state one that uses Apple’s so-called Taptic Engine to simulate the feeling of a button press, which makes the experience more natural for users. The change means there are fewer moving parts in the phone that can break, and Apple says this, in part, also made it possible for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to be water resistant. While setting up your new iPhone, you are asked to choose an intensity level - 1, 2, or 3 - that determines the amount of ‘feedback’ you get from the fake button. We left it and 2 - the default - and it’s safe to say that the first few hours with the new home button were a little awkward. We weren’t quite sure how much pressure to put on the button to register a press, how to trigger the Reachability shortcut, how to double tap, etc. After missing a few actions the first day, we got used to the new home button and now we don’t feel there’s anything amiss - that is when the device isn’t powered off. When your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus is switched off, the ‘button’ has absolutely no feel to it, which is a bit unnerving to this day. The natural instinct is to try and press the home button, but if the device is off, nothing happens at all, and though it isn’t a big deal in the grand scheme of things, we felt it’s worth highlighting. Another thing to remember with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is that the new way to force restart them is to hold the power and volume down buttons, not the power and home buttons as with all previous iOS devices. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have the same Touch ID fingerprint scanner as the last generation models did, which we described as too fast for their own good. We’d stated in our review of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus that it might make sense for Apple to switch to AMOLED displays to partially mitigate this problem, so certain elements like time can be visible on screen without waking up the entire display. While that hasn’t happened (yet), Apple has done something in an attempt to tackle this very problem. The new iPhone models will wake when lifted, which eliminates the need to touch any buttons if you just want to wake up the phone’s display and see the time and notifications on the lock screen. This means you no longer have to touch the home button to see notifications. Still, picking up your phone can be more awkward than just tapping the home button in many situations, so we aren’t entirely convinced if we have a satisfactory solution yet.  It’s worth pointing out that with iOS 10, Raise to Wake also rolled out to older iPhone models featuring the M9 motion coprocessor - the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE. An inconsistency seemingly related to the feature’s implementation across all models is that that the display doesn’t automatically wake up for all incoming notifications. We tried various combinations of apps and notifications to figure out situations in which the display wakes up automatically to show an incoming notification, and when it doesn’t, but we couldn’t identify a pattern. This was especially confusing when we were, for example, specifically waiting to hear from someone or waiting for an OTP to complete a transaction, and we had to raise the phone or press the home button to see that the message had indeed arrived without the display waking up at all. When it comes to raw performance, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the fastest phones on the planet, period. Day-to-day performance is a breeze, and while we did experience minor stutters on the iPhone 7 Plus in the pre-iOS 10.1 days, we have had very little to complain about since we installed the update. The iPhone 7 never suffered from any of these niggles, and despite the fact that it lacks the marquee camera features – though it packs in all the important ones, as we will see in a bit - and has weaker battery life compared to its bigger sibling, it became our preferred phone out of the duo, as we stated earlier. This is largely down to the improved battery life on the iPhone 7 compared to the iPhone 6s, as it can last an extra couple of hours on 3G/ 4G networks. While the battery life on the latter was just about enough to last a day, we always had a certain amount of range anxiety when it came to the battery life of our iPhone 6s, and preferred the extra bit of insurance that the 6s Plus offered in that department. This hasn’t been the case with the iPhone 7, and while we would’ve obviously liked the battery life to be even better, those extra couple of hours seem to make a big difference. Though the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus should each last you a day on a single charge, if you are a heavy user, the bigger iPhone still has clear benefits. In our battery loop test, the iPhone 7 lasted just under 10 hours, while the iPhone 7 Plus with its bigger battery but higher-resolution display lasted just over 10 hours. But in real-world usage, the iPhone 7 lasted us a day of moderate to heavy usage, while the iPhone 7 Plus had some juice left in the tank even at the end of busy days. The two phones performed identically in all our benchmarks, and blew the competition out of the water in most of them. In AnTuTu, the two phones scored over 176,000, way ahead of the likes of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and the Google Pixel XL. Only the much newer OnePlus 3T comes close, but it still scored nearly 2000 points less than the iPhone 7 Plus in our tests. We saw similar numbers with Geekbench’s single-core test, in which Apple’s offerings were an order of magnitude ahead of all other phones (including the OnePlus 3T). It was only in the Geekbench multi-core tests that they finished second-best to Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. If the browser-based tests like JetStream, Octane, and Basemark Web 3.0 had been boxing matches, they would have been stopped in round one, with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus declared clear winners. Apple fixed our biggest complaint with the previous generation iPhone models by finally bumping the internal storage on the base model to 32GB. Interestingly, the iPhone 7 Plus has 3GB of RAM while the iPhone 7 makes do with 2GB (though you won’t find any mention of this on Apple’s website, in typical Apple fashion). This does not seem to make any meaningful difference to the day-to-day performance of the two iPhone models - in fact our experience with the bigger iPhone 7 Plus was marginally worse, as described earlier. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus now have stereo speakers, at the top and bottom of the display. The left/ right channels swap around as you rotate the phone, and the top speaker takes the role of the right channel when you are looking at your phone in the portrait mode. Apple claims that the speakers deliver output that’s twice as loud as the ones in previous-generation iPhone models, and our experience was in line with this claim. Both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus support VoLTE out of the box and worked just fine with the Reliance Jio network for calling and data during our tests. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are ""splash, water, and dust resistant"", rated to survive for up to 30 minutes when submerged up to 1m deep, but the warranty doesn’t cover water damage. We’d advise you not to take them swimming with you, but feel free to use them around the pool.  The other big change with the new iPhone 7 models is of course the missing 3.5mm jack. Millions of lines have already been written on the subject - many of those on this site itself - so we won’t go into the pros and cons of the move, but instead focus on what our experience was like during the review period. As far as audio quality is concerned, the Lightning EarPods are no different to the EarPods that shipped with the previous generation iPhone models. We’ve been asked whether users need to muck around with any settings to get them to work, and the answer is no - audio starts playing through the EarPods as soon as you plug them into the iPhone 7’s Lightning port, just like regular headphones. The obvious downside of this is the fact that you can’t charge your phone and listen to music - or perhaps more significantly for some, take a hands-free call privately - if your phone is being charged. We missed this ability exactly once during our two-month old review period, and that didn’t really feel like enough of a reason to invest in third-party accessories that solve this problem. Your mileage may certainly vary, and it’s possible that you’ll end up being frustrated more frequently. If so, you will need to buy accessories, which is of course expensive, and might create new problems such as having one more thing to carry around - or you can choose to go wireless, again at a cost. If you are an audiophile, you likely already have a collection of third-party headphones, which may now need the bundled dongle to be useful. Interestingly, our lengthy review period made us realise that the problem works in reverse as well. Once we got used to travelling with only our Lightning EarPods, we ran into a couple of situations. On a flight, for example, we found ourselves staring at a 3.5mm jack, unable to do anything. We faced the same problem whenever we sat in front of our MacBook as well. Apple ships a dongle with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which lets you use your 3.5mm headphones with the new iPhone 7 models, but there’s no adaptor that will let you use your Lightning EarPods with a ‘legacy’ device. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus camerasEach year’s iPhone has traditionally been that year’s best camera phone, but that wasn’t necessarily true for the iPhone 6s Plus, the flag-bearer of the previous generation when it comes to camera performance. As we noted in our review, while it captured great photos in most situations, its low-light performance didn’t quite match what we got from Samsung’s competing offerings. Perhaps for the first time, Apple needed to play catch-up when it comes to camera performance, and as a result, this year’s models both have major changes to the optics. Though the rear camera is still rated at 12 megapixels, the iPhone 7 has a brand new sensor with an f/1.8 aperture, six-element lens, and optical image stabilisation - a feature that was only present in the bigger iPhone model last year. While the f/1.8 aperture is an improvement over last year’s f/2.2 aperture, it’s still not as good as what you get with the likes of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge which can go down to f/1.7, meaning its sensor can let in more light than the iPhone’s. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve undoubtedly heard that the iPhone 7 Plus has a dual camera setup. While most manufacturers have used the additional rear camera sensor to capture depth information, and some others have used it to capture black and white information to improve contrast and definition, Apple has gone with a slightly different approach. The iPhone 7 Plus has the same wide-angle f/1.8 lens seen on its smaller sibling, but also packs a second f/2.8 telephoto lens that allows for 2x optical zoom. iPhone 7 Plus at 1x iPhone 7 Plus at 2x zoom The camera app on the iPhone 7 Plus acknowledges this change with a new on-screen button towards the bottom. By default this reads 1x, which means you are using the regular lens. Tap on it and it changes to say 2x, which means you are now using the 2x telephoto lens. If you tap the button and hold it briefly, you are presented with a circular slider-like interface where you can choose the zoom level between 1x and 10x at 0.1x intervals (anything beyond 2x is digital zoom, obviously). Between, 1x and 2x zoom, the software supposedly combines images captured by both lenses to create a fused image, though the exact lens that is used at any zoom level depends on a variety of factors including the amount of available light. The telephoto lens gives you the convenient option of getting a closer look at subjects you are a little distance away from, without having to resort to cropping later. We found it particularly handy when attending events where someone was presenting on a stage as we sat in the audience, and were extremely happy with the results. As far as image quality is concerned, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus certainly benefit from Apple’s new image sensors, and the pictures we took in daylight looked natural, with best-in-class colour reproduction and plenty of detail. Low-light performance was also much better compared to the previous-generation iPhone models, but still marginally behind that of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, which always manages to surprise us with the amount of light its sensors are able to capture even when it seems dark to the naked eye. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus did manage to capture more colour information compared to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and Google Pixel XL, though overall we found low-light images taken with the Samsung phone the best. Tap to see full-sized iPhone 7 Plus camera samples The iPhone 7 packs in optical image stabilisation, a first for the smaller model, which means that performance on the two iPhone models is identical, apart from features that the secondary sensor enables. This means that unlike previous years, you don’t have to settle for worse camera performance when you pick the smaller iPhone. Having said that, the dual-camera mode on the iPhone 7 Plus enables another cool party trick - Portrait Mode. Available since the iOS 10.1 update, this feature lets you blur the background of a photo to get a cool bokeh effect, traditionally associated with DSLR cameras. It’s available as one of the modes (like Photo, Video, Panorama) in the Camera app on the iPhone 7 Plus, and you can see an approximation of how an image will come out. The app also tells you if you are too close to the subject for the mode to be effective. In practise, Portrait Mode has limitations that, while understandable, may not be evident to everyone who uses the app. For example, if the person whose picture you are trying to take is standing with multiple objects at different distances behind them, the results are not very effective. This is also the case if the subject and background are of roughly the same colour. When Portrait Mode works though, the results are quite good, and you would love to share them on social media. The app saves two versions of each Portrait Mode image - the standard image, and another with the depth effects applied. iPhone 7 Plus regular image - tap to see full size iPhone 7 Plus Portriat Mode effect in action - tap to see full size The Camera app is pretty much what you’ve seen on earlier iPhone models. The one new option (introduced in iOS 10.2) that some may find useful allows the Camera app to remember the last Mode (e.g. Video/ Square etc.) and Filter (e.g. Chrome) that was applied, instead of automatically resetting the options to Photo and None respectively. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus both have quad-LED True Tone flashes, compared to the previous models’ dual-LED ones, and this is one of the most effective, least overbearing camera phone flash implementations we’ve come across. The screen flash on the front camera is another one of our favourite features, lighting up faces in a natural way even in completely dark settings. Talking about the front camera, there are improvements like a bump to 7-megapixel sensor (compared to 5-megapixel), and full-HD video recording, compared to 720p seen on the iPhone 6s generation. As you would expect, the front camera also adds wide-gamut support, as well as auto image stabilisation. The front and rear camera now also support body and face detection (compared to only face detection in previous generation iPhone models), and you can use the optical zoom on the bigger 7 Plus during videos too. Other than that, the experience is pretty much identical to that with the previous generation iPhone models. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus softwareThe iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus come with iOS 10 out of the box, and while we’ve explored the new features elsewhere, let’s briefly touch upon some of them here. Perhaps the first thing you will notice is that the iconic Slide to Unlock is now gone; replaced by the initially confusing Press home to unlock. While this took some getting used on our previous-generation iOS devices, it feels a lot more natural on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus thanks to the redesigned home button. The other big change on the lock screen is the introduction of widgets. Swipe right and you will be greeted by a list of widgets, which were earlier restricted to the Notification Centre. The notifications that you see on the lock screen are also richer, letting you do a lot more than before. Whether you just want to check some information via the widgets or quickly respond to a message or an email, there are fewer reasons to unlock your iPhone. Of course this means you are potentially exposing a lot more information than before to anyone who might have physical access to your device, even without unlocking it. Thankfully, iOS has always had the ability to control the kind of notifications that are displayed on the lock screen, and you can obviously choose the widgets you want to see as well. You can also disable lock screen widgets completely if you want. Another big change that you might or might not notice is the ability to ‘uninstall’ some of the stock apps that iOS devices ship with. If you’ve ever looked at, say, the Stocks app or the Podcasts app, and thought you don’t have any use for them, there wasn’t really a way of getting rid of them from your device. What most people ended up doing is creating a folder (hello Apple Junk) that became the dumping ground for all such apps. Now, you don’t need the folder anymore; you can simply remove these apps like you’d remove any others. There are still a few things you need to remember though. First, when you uninstall an app, you are not really removing it from the device - the only thing that gets removed is its icon. This means you won’t free up any space on your device, which is a bit of a shame. On the flipside, if you ever want those apps back, just search for them on the App Store and they will ‘install’ in seconds. Lock screen widgets (left) and what happens when you tap a 'mailto' link with the Mail app uninstalled (right). Second, while you can uninstall most of Apple’s apps including the likes of Mail, some apps deemed critical to the operating system’s functioning cannot be removed. These include Phone, Messages, Settings, Camera, Photos, and Clock. While the ability to remove apps like Mail is nice, iOS still doesn’t let you set up a third-party email client like Gmail as your ‘default’ (aka handler of the ‘mailto:’ protocol), which is rather unfortunate. If you have uninstalled Mail and happen to click on a ‘mailto’ link, you will be greeted with a dialog that prompts you to again download the Mail app from the App Store. While Apple has taken steps towards opening up its mobile operating system since to the early days of iOS, it would be nice to finally have the ability to choose a default browser, email client, mapping application, and, dare we say, voice-based assistant - the latter, we realise, might be a bridge too far. Apple has opened up iOS 10 a little bit more with Siri integration, Maps extensions, and CallKit extensions, with the latter enabling deep integrations like TrueCaller. Third-party developers can now extend the functionality of Apple’s virtual assistant in certain predefined ways, so for example, you can now use Siri to hail an Uber, or to send someone a WhatsApp message. Needless to say, developers need to update their apps to take advantage of this functionality, and a lot of popular apps have done so since iOS 10 was released. Maps extension let Apple Maps leverage data from third-party apps and even extend their functionality. Zomato, for example, offers an extension that lets you see results from Zomato’s database while you are using Apple Maps. Both Uber and Ola offer extensions that let you book a cab from within Apple Maps. These extensions are silently installed but disabled by default, and you need to manually enable them under Settings before you can start using them. Of course none of this will really matter to users in India, since there are no signs within iOS of Apple Maps data in the country becoming anywhere near as good as that of Google Maps, or even basic features like navigation being supported. iOS 10 brings a bunch of other features, some of which we’ve covered earlier like iMessage apps, enhanced use of 3D Touch (including the ‘X’ at the top of your notifications screen to clear all notifications), Universal Clipboard (which is a bit hit-or-miss in the real world), a revamped Music app, and enhanced QuickType predictive reactions. The Photos app has a new face recognition feature that tries to identify people and group your photos accordingly, similar to what you might have seen in other apps. Apple takes great pains to reassure customers that all analysis of your photos and private data happens locally on your own device, but looking at the results, we have to wonder whether that’s a good trade-off. For starters, the level of recognition that the Photos app achieves leaves a lot to be desired. We were left with multiple groups of photos for the same person, which means it failed to recognise the same person in different situations. We tried to merge groups, but since these results are not synced up to the cloud, we had to repeat this process all our other devices (Photos on Mac uses a similar approach).  This is in contrast to, say, Google Photos, which does a much better job of identifying individuals across different photographs and also offers much more flexible search capabilities. In the Photos iOS app, you can only search for broad categories (e.g. Beach, Ball, Sculpture, etc.), apart from Places (each photo you click on the iPhone has location data), and the aforementioned People. Though Google Photos is a relatively new app, it builds on the cloud and machine learning expertise that Google has developed over the years, and feels a lot more mature than Apple’s. While we are on the subject, let’s thrown in another Photos-related complaint - we hate the fact there’s no way to share entire libraries between family members. Every time we come back from a trip, we find ourselves trying to remember whose iPhone we took that picture with; or at the end of the event, having to use AirDrop to quickly send photos to each other. Yes, Shared Photo Streams exist and they are great for sharing stuff selectively in certain situations, but we wish that iCloud Family Sharing had an opt-in common photo library and shared cloud storage quotas as well. While the cloud may not be Apple’s area of expertise, iOS remains the only platform that realistically offers security and the timely release of new features via software updates. The software update situation in the Android world shows no sign of improving; a stark contrast to the Apple side of things where a four-year-old iPhone 5 today receives updates the same day as Apple’s newest flagship phones. VerdictIt might sound strange to say this when talking about the most valuable company in the world, but Apple doesn’t always get the credit it deserves for its engineering efforts. The A10 Fusion chip inside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is a prime example of a company at the top of its game, and the way everything just comes together, especially on the iPhone 7, is nothing short of spectacular. We’ve been using the device for over two months now, and it still manages to delight us every single day. Yet, if you believe everything you read, you’ll come away with the impression that Apple is a marketing company that happens to be in the technology business, and its success is down to its ability to convince people to pay for its products, instead of any real technical acumen. Nothing could be further from the truth. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus cost a premium, but they deliver on almost every possible parameter, and they are certainly no stopgap before the rumoured tenth anniversary iPhone next year. Apple might of course wow us all next year by releasing something completely new and different, just like it did with the original iPhone, but that doesn’t take away from what you get from this year’s iPhone models right now - amazing performance, great cameras, good battery life, timely software updates, future-proof displays (in terms of colour, if not PPI), and a design that’s up there with Apple’s best efforts. If you are confused between the iPhone 7 and the 7 Plus or wondering which colour to get, we would like to put our weight behind the Jet Black iPhone 7. Yes, it gets scratched, but it’s a joy to hold - and use – every single day. The smaller iPhone’s camera now packs in the all-important optical image stabilisation feature, and the secondary lens isn’t reason enough for most people to pay a premium for the big iPhone. However, the extra RAM on the iPhone 7 Plus could theoretically make it more future-proof, especially if Apple’s rumoured move into the world of AR materialises, so you have a bit of a decision to make there. While there’s obviously a lot to love about Apple’s newest flagship phones, they aren’t perfect. The more time we spent with the iPhone 7, the more its bigger sibling seemed ungainly and just a tad bit slower in comparison. As we’ve mentioned before, Apple needs a reboot of the iPhone design to improve the screen-to-body ratio of its phones compared to other manufacturers – thankfully, rumours suggest we’ll get just that next season. We also wish the iPhone 7 had all of its bigger sibling’s features and specifications, so customers could choose between the two on size alone, and not worry about missing out on something - now, or in the future. The missing headphone jack didn’t bother us as much as we imagined it would, and it’s clear that Apple is pushing us towards a wireless future, even though its other big push for wireless audio hit a few bumps along the way. All in all, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus set the foundation for some fundamental technology like wide-gamut displays and wireless audio that will form a key part of Apple’s ecosystem going forward, and they do that while being compelling offerings in the present."
1720,21,iphone-7-and-iphone-7-plus-review-1643412,9,10,2016-12-30,1643412,Kunal Dua,iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/iphone-7-and-iphone-7-plus-review-1643412," The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launch this September represented a departure from tradition for Apple - and in many ways, a risk. Instead of the usual tick-tock cycle where each ’S’ release is followed by a brand-new design, the new iPhone models look pretty similar to their counterparts from the previous two years, and sport nearly identical dimensions. There are more changes than there are in a typical ‘S’ cycle, but if you have a Rose Gold iPhone 6s or a Silver iPhone 6 Plus, for example, the differences may not be apparent at first glance. In a world in which a device’s reception is driven by its looks, it was no surprise that the initial reaction to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus was lukewarm. Apple didn’t help matters with the ""courageous"" move of dropping the headphone port, with everyone and their friend Jack outraged even before anyone had a chance to test the impact of the move in the real world. So how do the new iPhone models stack up against their predecessors and competing flagships from the Android world? Like last year, we’ve spent more time than we do with most phones before sharing our thoughts with you, and here’s our review of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus designAs we mentioned earlier, the new iPhone models can easily be mistaken for their predecessors at first glance. The most visible change is that two of the antenna lines that marred the otherwise beautiful design of the previous iPhone models have been removed. The ones that remain are flush with the top and bottom edges, making them a lot less prominent than before; in fact, on the Black and Jet Black variants they are all but invisible. Which brings us to another break from tradition - the launch of not one, but two new colours. Gone is our previous favourite Space Grey, replaced with two great new options – Black, and the rather imaginatively named Jet Black. While the former has the same classy, understated matte finish as before, the latter features a glossy finish that makes it a bit of fingerprint magnet. Jet Black iPhone 7 This year, we received a Black iPhone 7 Plus and a Jet Black iPhone 7 as our review units. We spent our initial days alternating between using the two as our primary phones, before we ultimately settled on the iPhone 7. This was down to two reasons. First, the Jet Black finish itself. As we stated in our Sony Xperia XZ review, the Jet Black finish gives the best in-hand feel we’ve experienced with a mobile device. The finish has just the right balance between grip and smoothness. In comparison, the Black finish on our iPhone 7 Plus felt a bit too boring. Of course as someone who’s looking to buy a new phone, you can get the Jet Black finish in both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, so this won’t be a factor for you. Second, as we will discuss through the course of the review, the differences in performance and features between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus isn’t the same as between iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, so apart from the slightly cramped typing experience (we were using the iPhone 6s Plus as our primary device before), we didn’t feel like we were ‘settling’ for the smaller iPhone. Now we admit part of the appeal of the iPhone 7 could be our nostalgia for smaller phones in a world where every other new release seems to be pushing the envelope on how big a phone can get. Back to the Jet Black finish, and fingerprints are not the only thing it attracts - as Apple itself points out on its website, the new finish is more scratch-prone than others. Since we love the finish so much, and have never been fans of cases, we used the iPhone 7 without any protection for the duration of our testing, and for most of this time we couldn’t see what the fuss was about. Despite using it as our primary device for over two months, we didn’t notice any scratches on our Jet Black iPhone 7 - until we saw our unit under a particular light and then dozens of tiny scratches at the back suddenly became visible! Thankfully, this wasn’t a case of not being able to un-see something after having seen it. We went back to business without really being bothered, but if you are someone who worries about the resale value of your phone, this is something you might need to keep in mind. Typing on the iPhone 7 felt just a little bit cramped iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus displayHave you ever ordered something online only to find that the colours don’t quite match what you saw on your screen when it arrives? Don’t blame the store, blame the limitations of technology. Not many realise this, but the colours that you see on screen - whether it’s your mobile, laptop, or any other device - are only a visual approximation of real colours. In fact, no electronic device is capable of accurately representing the entire range of colours that occur naturally. Every display and even devices like cameras, which are used to capture colour information, have an associated colour profile that defines the range of colours (aka colour space) that they can display or capture. To ensure interoperability across devices, colour profiles have been standardised, and the most popular one is called sRGB. This is used by most displays (computer and mobile), cameras, printers, and other devices. Let’s take the example of an image where you have multiple shades of red - for example a gradient that goes from an extremely dark shade of red to the lightest possible red. While in the real world you will see this as a continuous stream of colour with virtually infinite strains of red in between, while capturing this information, your sRGB camera is limited by the number of red shades available in its colour space. This means that every pixel that doesn’t have a corresponding exact match in the sRGB colour gamut is replaced by its closest match. This is the main reason why gradients never look as smooth on our screens as they do in the real world. Like we mentioned earlier, we haven’t been able to make devices that accurately capture 100 percent of the colour information available in the real world, but there are devices that can capture more colour information than the sRGB colour space, minimising the inaccuracies introduced by digitisation. One such colour space is the DCI-P3 colour space that has a 25 percent larger colour gamut than sRGB, which means the approximation of colours that it offers is closer to the real world than what you get with standard sRGB devices. Now it’s important to understand that just having a display that supports the wide-colour gamut doesn’t mean you will see images and colours that are closer to the real world - the picture that you are seeing should’ve been captured using the wide colour profile to begin with. If your camera or scanner approximated the colours down to the sRGB colour space while capturing the image, there’s nothing your fancy wide display can do to offer a better viewing experience.  This long-winded explanation is a precursor to tell you that while the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have wide colour gamut displays (as Apple calls them), it doesn’t really make much of a difference in most day-to-day situations since most visual information is still being captured in the sRGB colour space. This means that most of the time the P3-capable displays are rendering a sRGB image, and it’s no surprise then that they look pretty similar to other displays. Even when you are viewing content that’s captured using the DCP-P3 colour space, you may not really notice the differences on the relatively small smartphone screen. This is further compounded by the fact that every smartphone out there uses colour matching techniques to display DCI-P3 content on its sRGB display, and every panel manufacturer may use a different algorithm to approximate the colours. Thrown in the differences in luminance, saturation, and other factors across screens, and there’s no saying which display will look the most ‘appealing’ to the naked eye. But Apple’s switch to the P3 colour space is about accurate colour reproduction and not how good the images look, and on that count the display on the iPhone 7 is said to be ""virtually indistinguishable from perfect"". As you would expect, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus’s cameras are capable of capturing information in the P3 space. While the new iPhone models as well as the latest MacBook Pro and iMac models will show these colours off in all their glory, you may not see them the same way while using any other phone or computer, unless of course your device is also listed to support the P3 colour space, like the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. To be fair, these inaccuracies are unlikely to bother the Average Joe using any other smartphone, but purists can rejoice in the knowledge that the iPhone 7 can now accurately display 4K content that’s captured in the DCI-P3 colour space, just like many expensive new television sets. The displays on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus continue to way behind the competition when it comes to resolution and pixels per inch, but this hasn’t bothered us in the past, and using the new models was no different. Text still appears sharp, and pixelation was never a problem. The new displays are rated to be 625 nits bright, compared to 500 nits each in the earlier models; a difference that’s clearly visible when you, say, put the iPhone 7 Plus next to an iPhone 6s Plus. Suffice to say the displays on the new iPhone models are bright enough for any situation.  iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus performance and battery lifeThe iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus famously do away with a physical home button. Instead of a button that moves when pressed, you have a static, solid-state one that uses Apple’s so-called Taptic Engine to simulate the feeling of a button press, which makes the experience more natural for users. The change means there are fewer moving parts in the phone that can break, and Apple says this, in part, also made it possible for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to be water resistant. While setting up your new iPhone, you are asked to choose an intensity level - 1, 2, or 3 - that determines the amount of ‘feedback’ you get from the fake button. We left it and 2 - the default - and it’s safe to say that the first few hours with the new home button were a little awkward. We weren’t quite sure how much pressure to put on the button to register a press, how to trigger the Reachability shortcut, how to double tap, etc. After missing a few actions the first day, we got used to the new home button and now we don’t feel there’s anything amiss - that is when the device isn’t powered off. When your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus is switched off, the ‘button’ has absolutely no feel to it, which is a bit unnerving to this day. The natural instinct is to try and press the home button, but if the device is off, nothing happens at all, and though it isn’t a big deal in the grand scheme of things, we felt it’s worth highlighting. Another thing to remember with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is that the new way to force restart them is to hold the power and volume down buttons, not the power and home buttons as with all previous iOS devices. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have the same Touch ID fingerprint scanner as the last generation models did, which we described as too fast for their own good. We’d stated in our review of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus that it might make sense for Apple to switch to AMOLED displays to partially mitigate this problem, so certain elements like time can be visible on screen without waking up the entire display. While that hasn’t happened (yet), Apple has done something in an attempt to tackle this very problem. The new iPhone models will wake when lifted, which eliminates the need to touch any buttons if you just want to wake up the phone’s display and see the time and notifications on the lock screen. This means you no longer have to touch the home button to see notifications. Still, picking up your phone can be more awkward than just tapping the home button in many situations, so we aren’t entirely convinced if we have a satisfactory solution yet.  It’s worth pointing out that with iOS 10, Raise to Wake also rolled out to older iPhone models featuring the M9 motion coprocessor - the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE. An inconsistency seemingly related to the feature’s implementation across all models is that that the display doesn’t automatically wake up for all incoming notifications. We tried various combinations of apps and notifications to figure out situations in which the display wakes up automatically to show an incoming notification, and when it doesn’t, but we couldn’t identify a pattern. This was especially confusing when we were, for example, specifically waiting to hear from someone or waiting for an OTP to complete a transaction, and we had to raise the phone or press the home button to see that the message had indeed arrived without the display waking up at all. When it comes to raw performance, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the fastest phones on the planet, period. Day-to-day performance is a breeze, and while we did experience minor stutters on the iPhone 7 Plus in the pre-iOS 10.1 days, we have had very little to complain about since we installed the update. The iPhone 7 never suffered from any of these niggles, and despite the fact that it lacks the marquee camera features – though it packs in all the important ones, as we will see in a bit - and has weaker battery life compared to its bigger sibling, it became our preferred phone out of the duo, as we stated earlier. This is largely down to the improved battery life on the iPhone 7 compared to the iPhone 6s, as it can last an extra couple of hours on 3G/ 4G networks. While the battery life on the latter was just about enough to last a day, we always had a certain amount of range anxiety when it came to the battery life of our iPhone 6s, and preferred the extra bit of insurance that the 6s Plus offered in that department. This hasn’t been the case with the iPhone 7, and while we would’ve obviously liked the battery life to be even better, those extra couple of hours seem to make a big difference. Though the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus should each last you a day on a single charge, if you are a heavy user, the bigger iPhone still has clear benefits. In our battery loop test, the iPhone 7 lasted just under 10 hours, while the iPhone 7 Plus with its bigger battery but higher-resolution display lasted just over 10 hours. But in real-world usage, the iPhone 7 lasted us a day of moderate to heavy usage, while the iPhone 7 Plus had some juice left in the tank even at the end of busy days. The two phones performed identically in all our benchmarks, and blew the competition out of the water in most of them. In AnTuTu, the two phones scored over 176,000, way ahead of the likes of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and the Google Pixel XL. Only the much newer OnePlus 3T comes close, but it still scored nearly 2000 points less than the iPhone 7 Plus in our tests. We saw similar numbers with Geekbench’s single-core test, in which Apple’s offerings were an order of magnitude ahead of all other phones (including the OnePlus 3T). It was only in the Geekbench multi-core tests that they finished second-best to Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. If the browser-based tests like JetStream, Octane, and Basemark Web 3.0 had been boxing matches, they would have been stopped in round one, with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus declared clear winners. Apple fixed our biggest complaint with the previous generation iPhone models by finally bumping the internal storage on the base model to 32GB. Interestingly, the iPhone 7 Plus has 3GB of RAM while the iPhone 7 makes do with 2GB (though you won’t find any mention of this on Apple’s website, in typical Apple fashion). This does not seem to make any meaningful difference to the day-to-day performance of the two iPhone models - in fact our experience with the bigger iPhone 7 Plus was marginally worse, as described earlier. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus now have stereo speakers, at the top and bottom of the display. The left/ right channels swap around as you rotate the phone, and the top speaker takes the role of the right channel when you are looking at your phone in the portrait mode. Apple claims that the speakers deliver output that’s twice as loud as the ones in previous-generation iPhone models, and our experience was in line with this claim. Both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus support VoLTE out of the box and worked just fine with the Reliance Jio network for calling and data during our tests. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are ""splash, water, and dust resistant"", rated to survive for up to 30 minutes when submerged up to 1m deep, but the warranty doesn’t cover water damage. We’d advise you not to take them swimming with you, but feel free to use them around the pool.  The other big change with the new iPhone 7 models is of course the missing 3.5mm jack. Millions of lines have already been written on the subject - many of those on this site itself - so we won’t go into the pros and cons of the move, but instead focus on what our experience was like during the review period. As far as audio quality is concerned, the Lightning EarPods are no different to the EarPods that shipped with the previous generation iPhone models. We’ve been asked whether users need to muck around with any settings to get them to work, and the answer is no - audio starts playing through the EarPods as soon as you plug them into the iPhone 7’s Lightning port, just like regular headphones. The obvious downside of this is the fact that you can’t charge your phone and listen to music - or perhaps more significantly for some, take a hands-free call privately - if your phone is being charged. We missed this ability exactly once during our two-month old review period, and that didn’t really feel like enough of a reason to invest in third-party accessories that solve this problem. Your mileage may certainly vary, and it’s possible that you’ll end up being frustrated more frequently. If so, you will need to buy accessories, which is of course expensive, and might create new problems such as having one more thing to carry around - or you can choose to go wireless, again at a cost. If you are an audiophile, you likely already have a collection of third-party headphones, which may now need the bundled dongle to be useful. Interestingly, our lengthy review period made us realise that the problem works in reverse as well. Once we got used to travelling with only our Lightning EarPods, we ran into a couple of situations. On a flight, for example, we found ourselves staring at a 3.5mm jack, unable to do anything. We faced the same problem whenever we sat in front of our MacBook as well. Apple ships a dongle with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which lets you use your 3.5mm headphones with the new iPhone 7 models, but there’s no adaptor that will let you use your Lightning EarPods with a ‘legacy’ device. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus camerasEach year’s iPhone has traditionally been that year’s best camera phone, but that wasn’t necessarily true for the iPhone 6s Plus, the flag-bearer of the previous generation when it comes to camera performance. As we noted in our review, while it captured great photos in most situations, its low-light performance didn’t quite match what we got from Samsung’s competing offerings. Perhaps for the first time, Apple needed to play catch-up when it comes to camera performance, and as a result, this year’s models both have major changes to the optics. Though the rear camera is still rated at 12 megapixels, the iPhone 7 has a brand new sensor with an f/1.8 aperture, six-element lens, and optical image stabilisation - a feature that was only present in the bigger iPhone model last year. While the f/1.8 aperture is an improvement over last year’s f/2.2 aperture, it’s still not as good as what you get with the likes of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge which can go down to f/1.7, meaning its sensor can let in more light than the iPhone’s. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve undoubtedly heard that the iPhone 7 Plus has a dual camera setup. While most manufacturers have used the additional rear camera sensor to capture depth information, and some others have used it to capture black and white information to improve contrast and definition, Apple has gone with a slightly different approach. The iPhone 7 Plus has the same wide-angle f/1.8 lens seen on its smaller sibling, but also packs a second f/2.8 telephoto lens that allows for 2x optical zoom. iPhone 7 Plus at 1x iPhone 7 Plus at 2x zoom The camera app on the iPhone 7 Plus acknowledges this change with a new on-screen button towards the bottom. By default this reads 1x, which means you are using the regular lens. Tap on it and it changes to say 2x, which means you are now using the 2x telephoto lens. If you tap the button and hold it briefly, you are presented with a circular slider-like interface where you can choose the zoom level between 1x and 10x at 0.1x intervals (anything beyond 2x is digital zoom, obviously). Between, 1x and 2x zoom, the software supposedly combines images captured by both lenses to create a fused image, though the exact lens that is used at any zoom level depends on a variety of factors including the amount of available light. The telephoto lens gives you the convenient option of getting a closer look at subjects you are a little distance away from, without having to resort to cropping later. We found it particularly handy when attending events where someone was presenting on a stage as we sat in the audience, and were extremely happy with the results. As far as image quality is concerned, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus certainly benefit from Apple’s new image sensors, and the pictures we took in daylight looked natural, with best-in-class colour reproduction and plenty of detail. Low-light performance was also much better compared to the previous-generation iPhone models, but still marginally behind that of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, which always manages to surprise us with the amount of light its sensors are able to capture even when it seems dark to the naked eye. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus did manage to capture more colour information compared to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and Google Pixel XL, though overall we found low-light images taken with the Samsung phone the best. Tap to see full-sized iPhone 7 Plus camera samples The iPhone 7 packs in optical image stabilisation, a first for the smaller model, which means that performance on the two iPhone models is identical, apart from features that the secondary sensor enables. This means that unlike previous years, you don’t have to settle for worse camera performance when you pick the smaller iPhone. Having said that, the dual-camera mode on the iPhone 7 Plus enables another cool party trick - Portrait Mode. Available since the iOS 10.1 update, this feature lets you blur the background of a photo to get a cool bokeh effect, traditionally associated with DSLR cameras. It’s available as one of the modes (like Photo, Video, Panorama) in the Camera app on the iPhone 7 Plus, and you can see an approximation of how an image will come out. The app also tells you if you are too close to the subject for the mode to be effective. In practise, Portrait Mode has limitations that, while understandable, may not be evident to everyone who uses the app. For example, if the person whose picture you are trying to take is standing with multiple objects at different distances behind them, the results are not very effective. This is also the case if the subject and background are of roughly the same colour. When Portrait Mode works though, the results are quite good, and you would love to share them on social media. The app saves two versions of each Portrait Mode image - the standard image, and another with the depth effects applied. iPhone 7 Plus regular image - tap to see full size iPhone 7 Plus Portriat Mode effect in action - tap to see full size The Camera app is pretty much what you’ve seen on earlier iPhone models. The one new option (introduced in iOS 10.2) that some may find useful allows the Camera app to remember the last Mode (e.g. Video/ Square etc.) and Filter (e.g. Chrome) that was applied, instead of automatically resetting the options to Photo and None respectively. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus both have quad-LED True Tone flashes, compared to the previous models’ dual-LED ones, and this is one of the most effective, least overbearing camera phone flash implementations we’ve come across. The screen flash on the front camera is another one of our favourite features, lighting up faces in a natural way even in completely dark settings. Talking about the front camera, there are improvements like a bump to 7-megapixel sensor (compared to 5-megapixel), and full-HD video recording, compared to 720p seen on the iPhone 6s generation. As you would expect, the front camera also adds wide-gamut support, as well as auto image stabilisation. The front and rear camera now also support body and face detection (compared to only face detection in previous generation iPhone models), and you can use the optical zoom on the bigger 7 Plus during videos too. Other than that, the experience is pretty much identical to that with the previous generation iPhone models. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus softwareThe iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus come with iOS 10 out of the box, and while we’ve explored the new features elsewhere, let’s briefly touch upon some of them here. Perhaps the first thing you will notice is that the iconic Slide to Unlock is now gone; replaced by the initially confusing Press home to unlock. While this took some getting used on our previous-generation iOS devices, it feels a lot more natural on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus thanks to the redesigned home button. The other big change on the lock screen is the introduction of widgets. Swipe right and you will be greeted by a list of widgets, which were earlier restricted to the Notification Centre. The notifications that you see on the lock screen are also richer, letting you do a lot more than before. Whether you just want to check some information via the widgets or quickly respond to a message or an email, there are fewer reasons to unlock your iPhone. Of course this means you are potentially exposing a lot more information than before to anyone who might have physical access to your device, even without unlocking it. Thankfully, iOS has always had the ability to control the kind of notifications that are displayed on the lock screen, and you can obviously choose the widgets you want to see as well. You can also disable lock screen widgets completely if you want. Another big change that you might or might not notice is the ability to ‘uninstall’ some of the stock apps that iOS devices ship with. If you’ve ever looked at, say, the Stocks app or the Podcasts app, and thought you don’t have any use for them, there wasn’t really a way of getting rid of them from your device. What most people ended up doing is creating a folder (hello Apple Junk) that became the dumping ground for all such apps. Now, you don’t need the folder anymore; you can simply remove these apps like you’d remove any others. There are still a few things you need to remember though. First, when you uninstall an app, you are not really removing it from the device - the only thing that gets removed is its icon. This means you won’t free up any space on your device, which is a bit of a shame. On the flipside, if you ever want those apps back, just search for them on the App Store and they will ‘install’ in seconds. Lock screen widgets (left) and what happens when you tap a 'mailto' link with the Mail app uninstalled (right). Second, while you can uninstall most of Apple’s apps including the likes of Mail, some apps deemed critical to the operating system’s functioning cannot be removed. These include Phone, Messages, Settings, Camera, Photos, and Clock. While the ability to remove apps like Mail is nice, iOS still doesn’t let you set up a third-party email client like Gmail as your ‘default’ (aka handler of the ‘mailto:’ protocol), which is rather unfortunate. If you have uninstalled Mail and happen to click on a ‘mailto’ link, you will be greeted with a dialog that prompts you to again download the Mail app from the App Store. While Apple has taken steps towards opening up its mobile operating system since to the early days of iOS, it would be nice to finally have the ability to choose a default browser, email client, mapping application, and, dare we say, voice-based assistant - the latter, we realise, might be a bridge too far. Apple has opened up iOS 10 a little bit more with Siri integration, Maps extensions, and CallKit extensions, with the latter enabling deep integrations like TrueCaller. Third-party developers can now extend the functionality of Apple’s virtual assistant in certain predefined ways, so for example, you can now use Siri to hail an Uber, or to send someone a WhatsApp message. Needless to say, developers need to update their apps to take advantage of this functionality, and a lot of popular apps have done so since iOS 10 was released. Maps extension let Apple Maps leverage data from third-party apps and even extend their functionality. Zomato, for example, offers an extension that lets you see results from Zomato’s database while you are using Apple Maps. Both Uber and Ola offer extensions that let you book a cab from within Apple Maps. These extensions are silently installed but disabled by default, and you need to manually enable them under Settings before you can start using them. Of course none of this will really matter to users in India, since there are no signs within iOS of Apple Maps data in the country becoming anywhere near as good as that of Google Maps, or even basic features like navigation being supported. iOS 10 brings a bunch of other features, some of which we’ve covered earlier like iMessage apps, enhanced use of 3D Touch (including the ‘X’ at the top of your notifications screen to clear all notifications), Universal Clipboard (which is a bit hit-or-miss in the real world), a revamped Music app, and enhanced QuickType predictive reactions. The Photos app has a new face recognition feature that tries to identify people and group your photos accordingly, similar to what you might have seen in other apps. Apple takes great pains to reassure customers that all analysis of your photos and private data happens locally on your own device, but looking at the results, we have to wonder whether that’s a good trade-off. For starters, the level of recognition that the Photos app achieves leaves a lot to be desired. We were left with multiple groups of photos for the same person, which means it failed to recognise the same person in different situations. We tried to merge groups, but since these results are not synced up to the cloud, we had to repeat this process all our other devices (Photos on Mac uses a similar approach).  This is in contrast to, say, Google Photos, which does a much better job of identifying individuals across different photographs and also offers much more flexible search capabilities. In the Photos iOS app, you can only search for broad categories (e.g. Beach, Ball, Sculpture, etc.), apart from Places (each photo you click on the iPhone has location data), and the aforementioned People. Though Google Photos is a relatively new app, it builds on the cloud and machine learning expertise that Google has developed over the years, and feels a lot more mature than Apple’s. While we are on the subject, let’s thrown in another Photos-related complaint - we hate the fact there’s no way to share entire libraries between family members. Every time we come back from a trip, we find ourselves trying to remember whose iPhone we took that picture with; or at the end of the event, having to use AirDrop to quickly send photos to each other. Yes, Shared Photo Streams exist and they are great for sharing stuff selectively in certain situations, but we wish that iCloud Family Sharing had an opt-in common photo library and shared cloud storage quotas as well. While the cloud may not be Apple’s area of expertise, iOS remains the only platform that realistically offers security and the timely release of new features via software updates. The software update situation in the Android world shows no sign of improving; a stark contrast to the Apple side of things where a four-year-old iPhone 5 today receives updates the same day as Apple’s newest flagship phones. VerdictIt might sound strange to say this when talking about the most valuable company in the world, but Apple doesn’t always get the credit it deserves for its engineering efforts. The A10 Fusion chip inside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is a prime example of a company at the top of its game, and the way everything just comes together, especially on the iPhone 7, is nothing short of spectacular. We’ve been using the device for over two months now, and it still manages to delight us every single day. Yet, if you believe everything you read, you’ll come away with the impression that Apple is a marketing company that happens to be in the technology business, and its success is down to its ability to convince people to pay for its products, instead of any real technical acumen. Nothing could be further from the truth. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus cost a premium, but they deliver on almost every possible parameter, and they are certainly no stopgap before the rumoured tenth anniversary iPhone next year. Apple might of course wow us all next year by releasing something completely new and different, just like it did with the original iPhone, but that doesn’t take away from what you get from this year’s iPhone models right now - amazing performance, great cameras, good battery life, timely software updates, future-proof displays (in terms of colour, if not PPI), and a design that’s up there with Apple’s best efforts. If you are confused between the iPhone 7 and the 7 Plus or wondering which colour to get, we would like to put our weight behind the Jet Black iPhone 7. Yes, it gets scratched, but it’s a joy to hold - and use – every single day. The smaller iPhone’s camera now packs in the all-important optical image stabilisation feature, and the secondary lens isn’t reason enough for most people to pay a premium for the big iPhone. However, the extra RAM on the iPhone 7 Plus could theoretically make it more future-proof, especially if Apple’s rumoured move into the world of AR materialises, so you have a bit of a decision to make there. While there’s obviously a lot to love about Apple’s newest flagship phones, they aren’t perfect. The more time we spent with the iPhone 7, the more its bigger sibling seemed ungainly and just a tad bit slower in comparison. As we’ve mentioned before, Apple needs a reboot of the iPhone design to improve the screen-to-body ratio of its phones compared to other manufacturers – thankfully, rumours suggest we’ll get just that next season. We also wish the iPhone 7 had all of its bigger sibling’s features and specifications, so customers could choose between the two on size alone, and not worry about missing out on something - now, or in the future. The missing headphone jack didn’t bother us as much as we imagined it would, and it’s clear that Apple is pushing us towards a wireless future, even though its other big push for wireless audio hit a few bumps along the way. All in all, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus set the foundation for some fundamental technology like wide-gamut displays and wireless audio that will form a key part of Apple’s ecosystem going forward, and they do that while being compelling offerings in the present."
1720,21,iphone-7-and-iphone-7-plus-review-1643412,9,10,2016-12-30,1643412,Kunal Dua,iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/iphone-7-and-iphone-7-plus-review-1643412," The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus launch this September represented a departure from tradition for Apple - and in many ways, a risk. Instead of the usual tick-tock cycle where each ’S’ release is followed by a brand-new design, the new iPhone models look pretty similar to their counterparts from the previous two years, and sport nearly identical dimensions. There are more changes than there are in a typical ‘S’ cycle, but if you have a Rose Gold iPhone 6s or a Silver iPhone 6 Plus, for example, the differences may not be apparent at first glance. In a world in which a device’s reception is driven by its looks, it was no surprise that the initial reaction to iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus was lukewarm. Apple didn’t help matters with the ""courageous"" move of dropping the headphone port, with everyone and their friend Jack outraged even before anyone had a chance to test the impact of the move in the real world. So how do the new iPhone models stack up against their predecessors and competing flagships from the Android world? Like last year, we’ve spent more time than we do with most phones before sharing our thoughts with you, and here’s our review of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus designAs we mentioned earlier, the new iPhone models can easily be mistaken for their predecessors at first glance. The most visible change is that two of the antenna lines that marred the otherwise beautiful design of the previous iPhone models have been removed. The ones that remain are flush with the top and bottom edges, making them a lot less prominent than before; in fact, on the Black and Jet Black variants they are all but invisible. Which brings us to another break from tradition - the launch of not one, but two new colours. Gone is our previous favourite Space Grey, replaced with two great new options – Black, and the rather imaginatively named Jet Black. While the former has the same classy, understated matte finish as before, the latter features a glossy finish that makes it a bit of fingerprint magnet. Jet Black iPhone 7 This year, we received a Black iPhone 7 Plus and a Jet Black iPhone 7 as our review units. We spent our initial days alternating between using the two as our primary phones, before we ultimately settled on the iPhone 7. This was down to two reasons. First, the Jet Black finish itself. As we stated in our Sony Xperia XZ review, the Jet Black finish gives the best in-hand feel we’ve experienced with a mobile device. The finish has just the right balance between grip and smoothness. In comparison, the Black finish on our iPhone 7 Plus felt a bit too boring. Of course as someone who’s looking to buy a new phone, you can get the Jet Black finish in both iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, so this won’t be a factor for you. Second, as we will discuss through the course of the review, the differences in performance and features between the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus isn’t the same as between iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, so apart from the slightly cramped typing experience (we were using the iPhone 6s Plus as our primary device before), we didn’t feel like we were ‘settling’ for the smaller iPhone. Now we admit part of the appeal of the iPhone 7 could be our nostalgia for smaller phones in a world where every other new release seems to be pushing the envelope on how big a phone can get. Back to the Jet Black finish, and fingerprints are not the only thing it attracts - as Apple itself points out on its website, the new finish is more scratch-prone than others. Since we love the finish so much, and have never been fans of cases, we used the iPhone 7 without any protection for the duration of our testing, and for most of this time we couldn’t see what the fuss was about. Despite using it as our primary device for over two months, we didn’t notice any scratches on our Jet Black iPhone 7 - until we saw our unit under a particular light and then dozens of tiny scratches at the back suddenly became visible! Thankfully, this wasn’t a case of not being able to un-see something after having seen it. We went back to business without really being bothered, but if you are someone who worries about the resale value of your phone, this is something you might need to keep in mind. Typing on the iPhone 7 felt just a little bit cramped iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus displayHave you ever ordered something online only to find that the colours don’t quite match what you saw on your screen when it arrives? Don’t blame the store, blame the limitations of technology. Not many realise this, but the colours that you see on screen - whether it’s your mobile, laptop, or any other device - are only a visual approximation of real colours. In fact, no electronic device is capable of accurately representing the entire range of colours that occur naturally. Every display and even devices like cameras, which are used to capture colour information, have an associated colour profile that defines the range of colours (aka colour space) that they can display or capture. To ensure interoperability across devices, colour profiles have been standardised, and the most popular one is called sRGB. This is used by most displays (computer and mobile), cameras, printers, and other devices. Let’s take the example of an image where you have multiple shades of red - for example a gradient that goes from an extremely dark shade of red to the lightest possible red. While in the real world you will see this as a continuous stream of colour with virtually infinite strains of red in between, while capturing this information, your sRGB camera is limited by the number of red shades available in its colour space. This means that every pixel that doesn’t have a corresponding exact match in the sRGB colour gamut is replaced by its closest match. This is the main reason why gradients never look as smooth on our screens as they do in the real world. Like we mentioned earlier, we haven’t been able to make devices that accurately capture 100 percent of the colour information available in the real world, but there are devices that can capture more colour information than the sRGB colour space, minimising the inaccuracies introduced by digitisation. One such colour space is the DCI-P3 colour space that has a 25 percent larger colour gamut than sRGB, which means the approximation of colours that it offers is closer to the real world than what you get with standard sRGB devices. Now it’s important to understand that just having a display that supports the wide-colour gamut doesn’t mean you will see images and colours that are closer to the real world - the picture that you are seeing should’ve been captured using the wide colour profile to begin with. If your camera or scanner approximated the colours down to the sRGB colour space while capturing the image, there’s nothing your fancy wide display can do to offer a better viewing experience.  This long-winded explanation is a precursor to tell you that while the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have wide colour gamut displays (as Apple calls them), it doesn’t really make much of a difference in most day-to-day situations since most visual information is still being captured in the sRGB colour space. This means that most of the time the P3-capable displays are rendering a sRGB image, and it’s no surprise then that they look pretty similar to other displays. Even when you are viewing content that’s captured using the DCP-P3 colour space, you may not really notice the differences on the relatively small smartphone screen. This is further compounded by the fact that every smartphone out there uses colour matching techniques to display DCI-P3 content on its sRGB display, and every panel manufacturer may use a different algorithm to approximate the colours. Thrown in the differences in luminance, saturation, and other factors across screens, and there’s no saying which display will look the most ‘appealing’ to the naked eye. But Apple’s switch to the P3 colour space is about accurate colour reproduction and not how good the images look, and on that count the display on the iPhone 7 is said to be ""virtually indistinguishable from perfect"". As you would expect, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus’s cameras are capable of capturing information in the P3 space. While the new iPhone models as well as the latest MacBook Pro and iMac models will show these colours off in all their glory, you may not see them the same way while using any other phone or computer, unless of course your device is also listed to support the P3 colour space, like the ill-fated Galaxy Note 7. To be fair, these inaccuracies are unlikely to bother the Average Joe using any other smartphone, but purists can rejoice in the knowledge that the iPhone 7 can now accurately display 4K content that’s captured in the DCI-P3 colour space, just like many expensive new television sets. The displays on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus continue to way behind the competition when it comes to resolution and pixels per inch, but this hasn’t bothered us in the past, and using the new models was no different. Text still appears sharp, and pixelation was never a problem. The new displays are rated to be 625 nits bright, compared to 500 nits each in the earlier models; a difference that’s clearly visible when you, say, put the iPhone 7 Plus next to an iPhone 6s Plus. Suffice to say the displays on the new iPhone models are bright enough for any situation.  iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus performance and battery lifeThe iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus famously do away with a physical home button. Instead of a button that moves when pressed, you have a static, solid-state one that uses Apple’s so-called Taptic Engine to simulate the feeling of a button press, which makes the experience more natural for users. The change means there are fewer moving parts in the phone that can break, and Apple says this, in part, also made it possible for the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus to be water resistant. While setting up your new iPhone, you are asked to choose an intensity level - 1, 2, or 3 - that determines the amount of ‘feedback’ you get from the fake button. We left it and 2 - the default - and it’s safe to say that the first few hours with the new home button were a little awkward. We weren’t quite sure how much pressure to put on the button to register a press, how to trigger the Reachability shortcut, how to double tap, etc. After missing a few actions the first day, we got used to the new home button and now we don’t feel there’s anything amiss - that is when the device isn’t powered off. When your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus is switched off, the ‘button’ has absolutely no feel to it, which is a bit unnerving to this day. The natural instinct is to try and press the home button, but if the device is off, nothing happens at all, and though it isn’t a big deal in the grand scheme of things, we felt it’s worth highlighting. Another thing to remember with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is that the new way to force restart them is to hold the power and volume down buttons, not the power and home buttons as with all previous iOS devices. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus have the same Touch ID fingerprint scanner as the last generation models did, which we described as too fast for their own good. We’d stated in our review of the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus that it might make sense for Apple to switch to AMOLED displays to partially mitigate this problem, so certain elements like time can be visible on screen without waking up the entire display. While that hasn’t happened (yet), Apple has done something in an attempt to tackle this very problem. The new iPhone models will wake when lifted, which eliminates the need to touch any buttons if you just want to wake up the phone’s display and see the time and notifications on the lock screen. This means you no longer have to touch the home button to see notifications. Still, picking up your phone can be more awkward than just tapping the home button in many situations, so we aren’t entirely convinced if we have a satisfactory solution yet.  It’s worth pointing out that with iOS 10, Raise to Wake also rolled out to older iPhone models featuring the M9 motion coprocessor - the iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, and iPhone SE. An inconsistency seemingly related to the feature’s implementation across all models is that that the display doesn’t automatically wake up for all incoming notifications. We tried various combinations of apps and notifications to figure out situations in which the display wakes up automatically to show an incoming notification, and when it doesn’t, but we couldn’t identify a pattern. This was especially confusing when we were, for example, specifically waiting to hear from someone or waiting for an OTP to complete a transaction, and we had to raise the phone or press the home button to see that the message had indeed arrived without the display waking up at all. When it comes to raw performance, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the fastest phones on the planet, period. Day-to-day performance is a breeze, and while we did experience minor stutters on the iPhone 7 Plus in the pre-iOS 10.1 days, we have had very little to complain about since we installed the update. The iPhone 7 never suffered from any of these niggles, and despite the fact that it lacks the marquee camera features – though it packs in all the important ones, as we will see in a bit - and has weaker battery life compared to its bigger sibling, it became our preferred phone out of the duo, as we stated earlier. This is largely down to the improved battery life on the iPhone 7 compared to the iPhone 6s, as it can last an extra couple of hours on 3G/ 4G networks. While the battery life on the latter was just about enough to last a day, we always had a certain amount of range anxiety when it came to the battery life of our iPhone 6s, and preferred the extra bit of insurance that the 6s Plus offered in that department. This hasn’t been the case with the iPhone 7, and while we would’ve obviously liked the battery life to be even better, those extra couple of hours seem to make a big difference. Though the iPhone 7 and the iPhone 7 Plus should each last you a day on a single charge, if you are a heavy user, the bigger iPhone still has clear benefits. In our battery loop test, the iPhone 7 lasted just under 10 hours, while the iPhone 7 Plus with its bigger battery but higher-resolution display lasted just over 10 hours. But in real-world usage, the iPhone 7 lasted us a day of moderate to heavy usage, while the iPhone 7 Plus had some juice left in the tank even at the end of busy days. The two phones performed identically in all our benchmarks, and blew the competition out of the water in most of them. In AnTuTu, the two phones scored over 176,000, way ahead of the likes of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and the Google Pixel XL. Only the much newer OnePlus 3T comes close, but it still scored nearly 2000 points less than the iPhone 7 Plus in our tests. We saw similar numbers with Geekbench’s single-core test, in which Apple’s offerings were an order of magnitude ahead of all other phones (including the OnePlus 3T). It was only in the Geekbench multi-core tests that they finished second-best to Samsung’s Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. If the browser-based tests like JetStream, Octane, and Basemark Web 3.0 had been boxing matches, they would have been stopped in round one, with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus declared clear winners. Apple fixed our biggest complaint with the previous generation iPhone models by finally bumping the internal storage on the base model to 32GB. Interestingly, the iPhone 7 Plus has 3GB of RAM while the iPhone 7 makes do with 2GB (though you won’t find any mention of this on Apple’s website, in typical Apple fashion). This does not seem to make any meaningful difference to the day-to-day performance of the two iPhone models - in fact our experience with the bigger iPhone 7 Plus was marginally worse, as described earlier. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus now have stereo speakers, at the top and bottom of the display. The left/ right channels swap around as you rotate the phone, and the top speaker takes the role of the right channel when you are looking at your phone in the portrait mode. Apple claims that the speakers deliver output that’s twice as loud as the ones in previous-generation iPhone models, and our experience was in line with this claim. Both the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus support VoLTE out of the box and worked just fine with the Reliance Jio network for calling and data during our tests. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are ""splash, water, and dust resistant"", rated to survive for up to 30 minutes when submerged up to 1m deep, but the warranty doesn’t cover water damage. We’d advise you not to take them swimming with you, but feel free to use them around the pool.  The other big change with the new iPhone 7 models is of course the missing 3.5mm jack. Millions of lines have already been written on the subject - many of those on this site itself - so we won’t go into the pros and cons of the move, but instead focus on what our experience was like during the review period. As far as audio quality is concerned, the Lightning EarPods are no different to the EarPods that shipped with the previous generation iPhone models. We’ve been asked whether users need to muck around with any settings to get them to work, and the answer is no - audio starts playing through the EarPods as soon as you plug them into the iPhone 7’s Lightning port, just like regular headphones. The obvious downside of this is the fact that you can’t charge your phone and listen to music - or perhaps more significantly for some, take a hands-free call privately - if your phone is being charged. We missed this ability exactly once during our two-month old review period, and that didn’t really feel like enough of a reason to invest in third-party accessories that solve this problem. Your mileage may certainly vary, and it’s possible that you’ll end up being frustrated more frequently. If so, you will need to buy accessories, which is of course expensive, and might create new problems such as having one more thing to carry around - or you can choose to go wireless, again at a cost. If you are an audiophile, you likely already have a collection of third-party headphones, which may now need the bundled dongle to be useful. Interestingly, our lengthy review period made us realise that the problem works in reverse as well. Once we got used to travelling with only our Lightning EarPods, we ran into a couple of situations. On a flight, for example, we found ourselves staring at a 3.5mm jack, unable to do anything. We faced the same problem whenever we sat in front of our MacBook as well. Apple ships a dongle with the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which lets you use your 3.5mm headphones with the new iPhone 7 models, but there’s no adaptor that will let you use your Lightning EarPods with a ‘legacy’ device. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus camerasEach year’s iPhone has traditionally been that year’s best camera phone, but that wasn’t necessarily true for the iPhone 6s Plus, the flag-bearer of the previous generation when it comes to camera performance. As we noted in our review, while it captured great photos in most situations, its low-light performance didn’t quite match what we got from Samsung’s competing offerings. Perhaps for the first time, Apple needed to play catch-up when it comes to camera performance, and as a result, this year’s models both have major changes to the optics. Though the rear camera is still rated at 12 megapixels, the iPhone 7 has a brand new sensor with an f/1.8 aperture, six-element lens, and optical image stabilisation - a feature that was only present in the bigger iPhone model last year. While the f/1.8 aperture is an improvement over last year’s f/2.2 aperture, it’s still not as good as what you get with the likes of Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge which can go down to f/1.7, meaning its sensor can let in more light than the iPhone’s. Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve undoubtedly heard that the iPhone 7 Plus has a dual camera setup. While most manufacturers have used the additional rear camera sensor to capture depth information, and some others have used it to capture black and white information to improve contrast and definition, Apple has gone with a slightly different approach. The iPhone 7 Plus has the same wide-angle f/1.8 lens seen on its smaller sibling, but also packs a second f/2.8 telephoto lens that allows for 2x optical zoom. iPhone 7 Plus at 1x iPhone 7 Plus at 2x zoom The camera app on the iPhone 7 Plus acknowledges this change with a new on-screen button towards the bottom. By default this reads 1x, which means you are using the regular lens. Tap on it and it changes to say 2x, which means you are now using the 2x telephoto lens. If you tap the button and hold it briefly, you are presented with a circular slider-like interface where you can choose the zoom level between 1x and 10x at 0.1x intervals (anything beyond 2x is digital zoom, obviously). Between, 1x and 2x zoom, the software supposedly combines images captured by both lenses to create a fused image, though the exact lens that is used at any zoom level depends on a variety of factors including the amount of available light. The telephoto lens gives you the convenient option of getting a closer look at subjects you are a little distance away from, without having to resort to cropping later. We found it particularly handy when attending events where someone was presenting on a stage as we sat in the audience, and were extremely happy with the results. As far as image quality is concerned, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus certainly benefit from Apple’s new image sensors, and the pictures we took in daylight looked natural, with best-in-class colour reproduction and plenty of detail. Low-light performance was also much better compared to the previous-generation iPhone models, but still marginally behind that of the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, which always manages to surprise us with the amount of light its sensors are able to capture even when it seems dark to the naked eye. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus did manage to capture more colour information compared to the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and Google Pixel XL, though overall we found low-light images taken with the Samsung phone the best. Tap to see full-sized iPhone 7 Plus camera samples The iPhone 7 packs in optical image stabilisation, a first for the smaller model, which means that performance on the two iPhone models is identical, apart from features that the secondary sensor enables. This means that unlike previous years, you don’t have to settle for worse camera performance when you pick the smaller iPhone. Having said that, the dual-camera mode on the iPhone 7 Plus enables another cool party trick - Portrait Mode. Available since the iOS 10.1 update, this feature lets you blur the background of a photo to get a cool bokeh effect, traditionally associated with DSLR cameras. It’s available as one of the modes (like Photo, Video, Panorama) in the Camera app on the iPhone 7 Plus, and you can see an approximation of how an image will come out. The app also tells you if you are too close to the subject for the mode to be effective. In practise, Portrait Mode has limitations that, while understandable, may not be evident to everyone who uses the app. For example, if the person whose picture you are trying to take is standing with multiple objects at different distances behind them, the results are not very effective. This is also the case if the subject and background are of roughly the same colour. When Portrait Mode works though, the results are quite good, and you would love to share them on social media. The app saves two versions of each Portrait Mode image - the standard image, and another with the depth effects applied. iPhone 7 Plus regular image - tap to see full size iPhone 7 Plus Portriat Mode effect in action - tap to see full size The Camera app is pretty much what you’ve seen on earlier iPhone models. The one new option (introduced in iOS 10.2) that some may find useful allows the Camera app to remember the last Mode (e.g. Video/ Square etc.) and Filter (e.g. Chrome) that was applied, instead of automatically resetting the options to Photo and None respectively. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus both have quad-LED True Tone flashes, compared to the previous models’ dual-LED ones, and this is one of the most effective, least overbearing camera phone flash implementations we’ve come across. The screen flash on the front camera is another one of our favourite features, lighting up faces in a natural way even in completely dark settings. Talking about the front camera, there are improvements like a bump to 7-megapixel sensor (compared to 5-megapixel), and full-HD video recording, compared to 720p seen on the iPhone 6s generation. As you would expect, the front camera also adds wide-gamut support, as well as auto image stabilisation. The front and rear camera now also support body and face detection (compared to only face detection in previous generation iPhone models), and you can use the optical zoom on the bigger 7 Plus during videos too. Other than that, the experience is pretty much identical to that with the previous generation iPhone models. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus softwareThe iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus come with iOS 10 out of the box, and while we’ve explored the new features elsewhere, let’s briefly touch upon some of them here. Perhaps the first thing you will notice is that the iconic Slide to Unlock is now gone; replaced by the initially confusing Press home to unlock. While this took some getting used on our previous-generation iOS devices, it feels a lot more natural on the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus thanks to the redesigned home button. The other big change on the lock screen is the introduction of widgets. Swipe right and you will be greeted by a list of widgets, which were earlier restricted to the Notification Centre. The notifications that you see on the lock screen are also richer, letting you do a lot more than before. Whether you just want to check some information via the widgets or quickly respond to a message or an email, there are fewer reasons to unlock your iPhone. Of course this means you are potentially exposing a lot more information than before to anyone who might have physical access to your device, even without unlocking it. Thankfully, iOS has always had the ability to control the kind of notifications that are displayed on the lock screen, and you can obviously choose the widgets you want to see as well. You can also disable lock screen widgets completely if you want. Another big change that you might or might not notice is the ability to ‘uninstall’ some of the stock apps that iOS devices ship with. If you’ve ever looked at, say, the Stocks app or the Podcasts app, and thought you don’t have any use for them, there wasn’t really a way of getting rid of them from your device. What most people ended up doing is creating a folder (hello Apple Junk) that became the dumping ground for all such apps. Now, you don’t need the folder anymore; you can simply remove these apps like you’d remove any others. There are still a few things you need to remember though. First, when you uninstall an app, you are not really removing it from the device - the only thing that gets removed is its icon. This means you won’t free up any space on your device, which is a bit of a shame. On the flipside, if you ever want those apps back, just search for them on the App Store and they will ‘install’ in seconds. Lock screen widgets (left) and what happens when you tap a 'mailto' link with the Mail app uninstalled (right). Second, while you can uninstall most of Apple’s apps including the likes of Mail, some apps deemed critical to the operating system’s functioning cannot be removed. These include Phone, Messages, Settings, Camera, Photos, and Clock. While the ability to remove apps like Mail is nice, iOS still doesn’t let you set up a third-party email client like Gmail as your ‘default’ (aka handler of the ‘mailto:’ protocol), which is rather unfortunate. If you have uninstalled Mail and happen to click on a ‘mailto’ link, you will be greeted with a dialog that prompts you to again download the Mail app from the App Store. While Apple has taken steps towards opening up its mobile operating system since to the early days of iOS, it would be nice to finally have the ability to choose a default browser, email client, mapping application, and, dare we say, voice-based assistant - the latter, we realise, might be a bridge too far. Apple has opened up iOS 10 a little bit more with Siri integration, Maps extensions, and CallKit extensions, with the latter enabling deep integrations like TrueCaller. Third-party developers can now extend the functionality of Apple’s virtual assistant in certain predefined ways, so for example, you can now use Siri to hail an Uber, or to send someone a WhatsApp message. Needless to say, developers need to update their apps to take advantage of this functionality, and a lot of popular apps have done so since iOS 10 was released. Maps extension let Apple Maps leverage data from third-party apps and even extend their functionality. Zomato, for example, offers an extension that lets you see results from Zomato’s database while you are using Apple Maps. Both Uber and Ola offer extensions that let you book a cab from within Apple Maps. These extensions are silently installed but disabled by default, and you need to manually enable them under Settings before you can start using them. Of course none of this will really matter to users in India, since there are no signs within iOS of Apple Maps data in the country becoming anywhere near as good as that of Google Maps, or even basic features like navigation being supported. iOS 10 brings a bunch of other features, some of which we’ve covered earlier like iMessage apps, enhanced use of 3D Touch (including the ‘X’ at the top of your notifications screen to clear all notifications), Universal Clipboard (which is a bit hit-or-miss in the real world), a revamped Music app, and enhanced QuickType predictive reactions. The Photos app has a new face recognition feature that tries to identify people and group your photos accordingly, similar to what you might have seen in other apps. Apple takes great pains to reassure customers that all analysis of your photos and private data happens locally on your own device, but looking at the results, we have to wonder whether that’s a good trade-off. For starters, the level of recognition that the Photos app achieves leaves a lot to be desired. We were left with multiple groups of photos for the same person, which means it failed to recognise the same person in different situations. We tried to merge groups, but since these results are not synced up to the cloud, we had to repeat this process all our other devices (Photos on Mac uses a similar approach).  This is in contrast to, say, Google Photos, which does a much better job of identifying individuals across different photographs and also offers much more flexible search capabilities. In the Photos iOS app, you can only search for broad categories (e.g. Beach, Ball, Sculpture, etc.), apart from Places (each photo you click on the iPhone has location data), and the aforementioned People. Though Google Photos is a relatively new app, it builds on the cloud and machine learning expertise that Google has developed over the years, and feels a lot more mature than Apple’s. While we are on the subject, let’s thrown in another Photos-related complaint - we hate the fact there’s no way to share entire libraries between family members. Every time we come back from a trip, we find ourselves trying to remember whose iPhone we took that picture with; or at the end of the event, having to use AirDrop to quickly send photos to each other. Yes, Shared Photo Streams exist and they are great for sharing stuff selectively in certain situations, but we wish that iCloud Family Sharing had an opt-in common photo library and shared cloud storage quotas as well. While the cloud may not be Apple’s area of expertise, iOS remains the only platform that realistically offers security and the timely release of new features via software updates. The software update situation in the Android world shows no sign of improving; a stark contrast to the Apple side of things where a four-year-old iPhone 5 today receives updates the same day as Apple’s newest flagship phones. VerdictIt might sound strange to say this when talking about the most valuable company in the world, but Apple doesn’t always get the credit it deserves for its engineering efforts. The A10 Fusion chip inside the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus is a prime example of a company at the top of its game, and the way everything just comes together, especially on the iPhone 7, is nothing short of spectacular. We’ve been using the device for over two months now, and it still manages to delight us every single day. Yet, if you believe everything you read, you’ll come away with the impression that Apple is a marketing company that happens to be in the technology business, and its success is down to its ability to convince people to pay for its products, instead of any real technical acumen. Nothing could be further from the truth. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus cost a premium, but they deliver on almost every possible parameter, and they are certainly no stopgap before the rumoured tenth anniversary iPhone next year. Apple might of course wow us all next year by releasing something completely new and different, just like it did with the original iPhone, but that doesn’t take away from what you get from this year’s iPhone models right now - amazing performance, great cameras, good battery life, timely software updates, future-proof displays (in terms of colour, if not PPI), and a design that’s up there with Apple’s best efforts. If you are confused between the iPhone 7 and the 7 Plus or wondering which colour to get, we would like to put our weight behind the Jet Black iPhone 7. Yes, it gets scratched, but it’s a joy to hold - and use – every single day. The smaller iPhone’s camera now packs in the all-important optical image stabilisation feature, and the secondary lens isn’t reason enough for most people to pay a premium for the big iPhone. However, the extra RAM on the iPhone 7 Plus could theoretically make it more future-proof, especially if Apple’s rumoured move into the world of AR materialises, so you have a bit of a decision to make there. While there’s obviously a lot to love about Apple’s newest flagship phones, they aren’t perfect. The more time we spent with the iPhone 7, the more its bigger sibling seemed ungainly and just a tad bit slower in comparison. As we’ve mentioned before, Apple needs a reboot of the iPhone design to improve the screen-to-body ratio of its phones compared to other manufacturers – thankfully, rumours suggest we’ll get just that next season. We also wish the iPhone 7 had all of its bigger sibling’s features and specifications, so customers could choose between the two on size alone, and not worry about missing out on something - now, or in the future. The missing headphone jack didn’t bother us as much as we imagined it would, and it’s clear that Apple is pushing us towards a wireless future, even though its other big push for wireless audio hit a few bumps along the way. All in all, the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus set the foundation for some fundamental technology like wide-gamut displays and wireless audio that will form a key part of Apple’s ecosystem going forward, and they do that while being compelling offerings in the present."
2177,21,iphone-8-review-iphone-8-plus-review-1756902,9,10,2017-09-29,1756902,Kunal Dua,iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/iphone-8-review-iphone-8-plus-review-1756902," It’s not very often that two new iPhone models are upstaged at their own launch, but that’s exactly what happened at Apple’s September event this year. The iPhone X was the star of the show, the cool new kid everyone wanted to hang out with, while the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus were relegated to the role of the designated driver - boring, reliable, the one you know will be there once you are done partying with your new friends. That was certainly the case at the hands-on area post the launch event at the Steve Jobs Theatre, where everyone stood in line just to spend some time with the iPhone X, while most iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus units waited for an audience. But as quickly as it came, the cool new thing was gone, not to be seen again until November. Having seen the one with the X-factor, it seems not everyone is excited at that prospect of getting reunited with their ‘boring’ old friends.    If there’s one thing that being in your 30s teaches you, it’s that ‘boring’ has a lot going for it. You learn to value familiarity over the latest trend and appreciate the reliability that comes with the tried and tested. Have doubts about Face ID on the iPhone X? Touch ID on the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus works great as always. Can’t get your head around the ‘notch’? No such thing on the 'standard' models. It’s this familiarity and reliability that these two models hope to appeal to, though Apple wouldn’t want the ‘boring’ tag anywhere near the duo, even if we frequently use the word as a compliment. Let’s forget about the iPhone X for a bit and see how the other two new iPhone models fare in a world where their sibling doesn’t exist. Are they compelling enough upgrades in their own right? Let’s find out. From the front, the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are practically indistinguishable from their predecessors. Virtually everyone we showed our review units to opened with “Oh, it looks just like the [iPhone] 7” before we asked them to turn them around and look at the all-glass backs. That’s right, the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are all-glass on the front and the back, a throwback to the design last seen in the iPhone 4S. Apple says it has used “the most durable glass ever in a smartphone”, a claim that millions will no doubt put to the test in everyday life in the days to come. During the couple of weeks that we’ve spent with these phones, we - accidentally, we promise - managed to drop them once each. First, the iPhone 8, face down, from a coffee table, and then the iPhone 8 Plus from a height of about four feet. While the iPhone 8 escaped unhurt, its bigger sibling landed on tiles on one of its corners and had a little abrasion to show for it afterwards - a stark reminder as to why most people choose to cover their precious phones in cases. While on the subject, though the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are marginally bigger than their predecessors, we had no problem fitting our Apple leather cases from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus onto them. Most existing third-party cases designed for the older iPhone models should fit just fine as well. At 148 grams, the iPhone 8 is the heaviest non-Plus iPhone to date, while the iPhone 8 Plus crosses the 200g mark. The extra weight would be noticeable if you used an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus without a case, but if you are someone who changes your case quite often, you are probably used to the overall weight fluctuating slightly and are unlikely to notice these differences. Still, it’s interesting to see a company obsessed with ‘thin and light’ move in the opposite direction with two of its marquee products. If showing the world you have the latest and greatest iPhone (we told you to forget about the iPhone X, remember?) is important to you, hiding your iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus in a non-transparent case would not be the best idea. As we said earlier, the front is virtually identical to that of the previous generation iPhone models, so the only visible difference is in the back. From five (not counting the Product Red) colour options in the previous generation - Rose Gold, Gold, Silver, Black, and Jet Black - we are down to three - Gold, Silver, and Space Grey. iPhone 8 (left) and iPhone 8 Plus in Silver and Gold colours respectively   The Gold finish on the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus looks like an amalgamation of the Rose Gold and Gold colours seen previously. Silver is essentially white, and Space Grey is black. The latter is the only option that’s black on the front, while the other two have white bezels, like in previous years. Colours are largely a personal choice, though we have to say we will miss the Jet Black finish, despite its well-documented tendency to get scuffed up. The nearly-all-glass body means that all iPhone models offer excellent grip, and are unlikely to slip out of your hands. In the two weeks that we spent with the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, we didn’t see any scratches or scuff marks resulting from being put into and taken out of pockets, or being stored with other objects in our bag. In the box you get Lightning EarPods, a Lightning to 3.5mm adapter, a USB Type-A to Lightning cable, and a 5W charger (more on this later), apart from the phone itself, and some literature. There’s no Type-C to Lightning cable, which means you cannot directly connect Apple’s flagship phone to its flagship laptops without buying additional cables or dongles from Apple or third parties. There’s no change in the size of the displays on the iPhone 8 or the iPhone 8 Plus compared to their predecessors, and, indeed, the screens have the same resolution, brightness, and contrast ratios as well. OLED and HDR support are reserved for the iPhone X, so the only improvement here is the addition of True Tone functionality. Spot the difference: iPhone 8 (right) with True Tone enabled, alongside iPhone 7   According to Apple, True Tone technology “uses an advanced four‑channel ambient light sensor to subtly adjust the white balance onscreen to match the colour temperature of the light around you.” If that sounds like a load of jargon, we are here to help. In simple terms, like recent iPad Pro models, additional sensors present in the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus can detect the quality of light around you, and the phone can tweak the display’s white balance to match. This is designed to reduce eye strain and make objects on screen look “as natural as on a printed page”. In terms of real-world experience, perhaps the most significant word in the previous paragraph is “subtly”. The presence of True Tone - a setting that is turned on by default, but can be switched off if you really care about colour accuracy - is unlikely to be noticed by most users. The effect is nowhere as dramatic as turning on Night Shift, which alters the tone of the display and cuts blue light emission to reduce eye strain in a very visible way, and was introduced in iOS 9.3. Most users probably even won’t notice (which, as Apple will tell you, is a good thing) True Tone’s impact until they see their phone side by side with one that doesn’t have the setting enabled. You will no longer find the Auto-Brightness option under Display settings. Turned on by default, this option is instead available under Display Accommodations in Accessibility settings, a hint by Apple that most users shouldn't bother toggling it on an everyday basis. iOS 11 even warns you that turning auto brightness off may have an impact on battery life. The auto-brightness toggle (right) is now found under Accessibility options While the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus might not look very different from the outside, there are big changes on the inside. All three new iPhone models - okay, we promise no reminders that the iPhone X exists after this - are powered by Apple’s brand new A11 Bionic chip. In our review of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus we noted how Apple has established itself as a leader in the mobile SoC space, and how both phones were streets ahead of the competition in terms of raw performance at the time of their release. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus continue this tradition, and in some ways kick things up a notch higher. The Apple A10 Fusion inside the previous-generation iPhone models was a quad-core chip with two high-performance cores and two energy-efficient ones, but only one pair could be active at a time. The A11 Bionic, on the other hand, has six cores - four efficient cores that are up to 70 percent faster than ones on the A10, and two performance cores that are up to 25 percent faster - making it Apple’s first hexa-core chip. More importantly, the A11 is capable of running all six at the same time. This means the Apple A11 Bionic absolutely smokes the opposition, especially when it comes to multi-threaded tasks that can scale to multiple cores. In the Geekbench multi-core test, for example, the iPhone 8 Plus scored more than 55 percent higher than the OnePlus 5, the phone that had scored the highest before now, and around 75 percent higher than the iPhone 7 Plus. In fact, its Geekbench multi-core score of 10,386 is higher than that of many laptops out there.  For the first time, an iOS device features an Apple-designed GPU. Given the CPU performance lead that Apple established with the A-series by moving chip design in-house, we’ll be closely watching what the company has to offer in this department. The A11 Bionic features a new Apple‑designed three‑core integrated GPU that delivers a ‘paltry’ 30 percent performance gain over the A10 Fusion. All this power means that the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus can handle everything you throw at them with ease. Everyday tasks are smooth, and everything feels really snappy, especially on the smaller iPhone. We experienced a few niggles during the initial days of our review period, but the iOS 11.0.1 update seems to have addressed all of them. We’ve covered iOS 11 in depth elsewhere on Gadgets 360, so we won’t repeat ourselves here, but talk about a couple of other interesting new features instead. Perhaps the first thing you’ll notice when setting up your new iPhone is that you now have the option to use Quick Start to, well, quickly set up your device. Just hold your new iPhone (or iPad running iOS 11) next to another recent iOS device, and after ‘pairing’ the two, some of your settings like your Apple ID are automatically transferred to the new one. It will also ‘inherit’ your old device’s passcode. Remember that this step just copies some of the settings from the old device to the new one - you still get to choose whether you want to restore apps and data from an iCloud/ iTunes backup or set this device up as new. In our experience, Quick Start saved a couple of steps during the setup process, and the post-restore experience wasn’t that different compared to a ‘regular’ restore from an iCloud backup. We still had to enter passwords and set up email accounts, etc, in third-party apps. While older iOS devices do support ARKit - Apple’s framework for augmented reality games and apps - the latest iPhone models truly shine when it comes to bridging the digital and physical worlds. Apple says the cameras on the new iPhone models are “individually calibrated” with new gyroscopes and accelerometers to enable more accurate motion tracking than the older iPhone models. The A11 Bionic chip is faster at things like world tracking and scene recognition, and the new image signal processor (ISP) is capable of real-time lighting estimation when using AR apps. With ARKit, anyone can have a dragon as a pet   Sadly, iOS 11 does little to improve the experience of using first-party apps in India: Apple Maps is still practically useless here and doesn’t even have basic navigation features, even as Apple is adding lane guidance and more in other regions. This means other apps’ features like Calendar’s ‘time to leave’ alerts for meetings don’t work either. There’s also no sign of Apple Pay, even as rival Samsung’s payment service can be used at virtually every point of sale in the country. Though Apple doesn’t officially state the amount of RAM that iOS devices ship with, third-party teardowns and benchmark apps have revealed that the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus have 2GB and 3GB of RAM respectively, figures that are identical to those of their predecessors. What is new, and a welcome change, is the amount of storage that you get on the base model. You now get 64GB of storage on the entry-level iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus (compared to 32GB earlier), and the only step up is to 256GB. What this means is that not only has Apple reduced the number of colours the latest iPhone models are available in from five (ignoring Product Red) to three, but the number of storage variants has also gone down from three to two, reducing the total number of SKUs across the lineup from a whopping 30 (5x3x2) to a more manageable 12 (3x2x2). The entry price of the flagship iPhone lineup has gone up as well - $50 in the US and Rs. 4,000 if you compare the iPhone 8’s launch price with that of the equivalent iPhone 7 a year ago, though it’s worth reminding our readers that MRP of the 32GB iPhone 7 was reduced to Rs. 56,100 after launch, so in a way the Rs. 64,000 price tag of the 64GB iPhone 8 is Rs. 8,000 higher than that of its predecessor. Apple says the increase was necessary as its input costs have gone up, a claim that may have some merit as global RAM and flash storage prices have been on the rise recently. Rival Samsung has also launched its flagship smartphones at higher price points this year, so Apple is certainly not alone in this regard. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus both had stereo speakers, as do the new models. Apple says the new speakers are up to 25 percent louder and deliver deeper bass, a claim we found to be true during our testing. Like their predecessors, the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are IP67 rated for water and dust resistance, which means they can be submerged in depths of 1 metre or less for up to 30 minutes, though, like before, Apple’s warranty won’t cover liquid damage. The glass back of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus is not just a design element, it enables an important feature: wireless charging. Apple has adopted the Qi industry standard of wireless charging, which means that though the new iPhone models don’t ship with a wireless charger, you can pick up one of the many third-party Qi-compatible ones out there. The likes of Samsung have supported this standard for a while, so we finally live in a world where the same charger can top up both your iPhone 8 and Galaxy Note 8. If you are new to the world of wireless charging, you need to remember a couple of points: first, it’s not really ‘wireless’. Most wireless charging mechanisms involve a plate of some sort where you can just place your phone and have it begin charging without plugging in any wires, but the plate itself needs to be connected to an outlet via a wire or an adapter. Second, though there have been improvements in the technology recently, wireless charging is still painfully slow. Look ma, no wires! Err... not quite.   Apple gave us a 7.5W Belkin wireless charger to test this feature on the new iPhone models with, and it took 24 minutes to move the battery on the iPhone 8 Plus from 20 percent to 30 percent. Apple’s bundled 5W wired adapter charged the same phone from 20 percent to 36 percent in the same time. iPhone models have supported faster charging - using an iPad’s 10W charger, for example - for a while, so it’s baffling why Apple continues to ship such a low-power charger in the box. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus support even faster charging using USB Type-C, but you will need to buy an expensive power adapter that is compatible with the USB Type-C Power Delivery specification and a Type-C to Lightning cable just to use this feature. If you already have a current (or previous generation) Apple MacBook, you can use its charger, but you will still need to buy the cable. Using our MacBook Pro’s 78W charger and a third-party Type-C to Lightning cable, we could top up the battery in our iPhone 8 Plus from 20 percent to 51 percent in the same 24 minutes. Having said that, forking out nearly Rs. 70,000 on a phone and then being expected to spend even more to enable what should be standard functionality is classic Apple up-selling that rightly upsets many. In terms of battery life, the experience using the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus was similar to that with their predecessors: the former will just about manage a day of use if you don’t do a lot of heavy lifting, while the latter will easily get through a day with some juice to spare. In our HD video loop test, the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus clocked nearly 8.5 hours and 9.5 hours respectively. Camera performance is an area where smartphones have made arguably the biggest improvements in the decade since the original iPhone was launched. From tiny, grainy images in which we could barely recognise ourselves to ones that can be printed on a billboard, and movies that see a theatrical release, the phone camera has come a long way in a relatively short period of time. For most of this journey, Apple has enjoyed the status of having the best camera phone out there, and the company has taken a lot of pride in calling the iPhone the most popular camera in the world. But as we’ve noted in our recent iPhone reviews, this hasn’t necessarily been true for the last couple of generations. Samsung, HTC, and Google (with the HTC-made Pixel) have caught up with - and in some scenarios even surpassed - the iPhone’s camera performance, which means the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus will need to really up their game to regain the crown. With tight control of hardware as well as software, Apple seems to have done just that. While the camera specifications remain the same in terms of megapixel counts and aperture sizes, Apple says the 12-megapixel primary camera has a larger and faster sensor, a new colour filter, and deeper pixels. As noted earlier, the A11 Bionic chip includes a brand new Apple-designed image signal processor, which, among other things, aims to provide faster autofocus in low light and better HDR photos. Tap to see full-sized iPhone 8 camera samples   All this is backed by enhancements at the OS level. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus support the new High Efficiency Image File Format (HEIF) and High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) container for storing photos and videos respectively, which, Apple says, reduce the amount of space taken by your media by up to 50 percent. This, obviously, means you can save more photos and videos on your device and in the cloud. HEVC also enables new capabilities like shooting 4K video at 60fps and 1080p at 240fps. If you set up an iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus as a new device, they will save media in the new formats by default. Technically, HEIF is a new file format, and your images are no longer stored as JPGs on the phone. But for the most part, you don’t need to worry about this. When you share photos and videos using others using apps like Facebook, they will automatically be converted to JPG or H.264 respectively, so everyone can see them. If you want, you can have your phone use JPG/ H.264 by default by going to Settings > Camera > Formats and choosing Most Compatible, though you will miss out on the space savings and the ability to shoot 4K/60fps and 1080p/240fps. If you restore your iPhone from an iOS 10 backup, it might have the Most Compatible option selected by default, which means you will not see the additional video shooting modes. You can safely switch to High Efficiency without any problems if you so desire (we recommend that you do). With all that work put in, how do the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus fare in terms of camera performance in the real world? In daylight, we noticed that the new iPhone models capture the most accurate colours and more details than the likes of the Galaxy Note 8 and HTC U11. In macro shots, again the phones had the best-in-class colour reproduction, but the amount of detail captured was just a fraction less than the HTC U11. Tap to see full-sized iPhone 8 Plus camera samples   Low-light performance is greatly improved compared to that of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and with good reason. This is one area in which Apple had fallen considerably behind its competitors. While the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus still don’t quite capture as much detail as the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 and HTC U11 in low-light conditions, their sensors still manage to do a lot better than before. At times, noise is visible when you zoom in, but most people will be perfectly happy with the results. Overall, we believe the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are now at par with the likes of the HTC U11 and Galaxy Note 8, but not significantly better than either in any one aspect of still photography other than capturing the most accurate colours (which obviously matters a lot). The camera performance of the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus is identical, though the latter obviously has the ability to use up to 2x optical zoom thanks to the additional telephoto lens. The headline camera feature of the iPhone 7 Plus was its Portrait Mode, which was enabled in a software update that shipped after the phone’s launch. The iPhone 8 Plus retains and greatly improves on this feature, and some of the portraits that we shot with it were just stunning. “DSLR-like” is a marketing phrase often used by companies to sell their phones, but in this case, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration. A new feature called Portrait Lighting lets you tweak the light on your face and in the background after you’ve taken a portrait or in real time while composing your frame, but with mixed results. Like the original Portrait Mode, how it performs dependson a lot on the background, the subject, and the lighting in the frame. Apple is labelling this feature as ‘beta’ and just like Portrait Mode, it should get better in the future thanks to machine learning. The Portrait Lighting feature in action   The iPhone was already our favourite phone for shooting videos with, and the addition of 4K/ 60fps and 1080/ 240fps means that its video capabilities are unmatched. If you shoot a lot of videos with your phone, you don’t need to look beyond the iPhone 8/ iPhone 8 Plus, with the latter supporting 2x optical zoom in video mode as well. We are not into selfies but if you are, the front camera on the new iPhone models packs enough punch to keep you happy. We believe that the best photos are taken with the flash turned off, but we realise most people leave it on the default ‘auto’ option, which means it inevitably triggers in low-light conditions. Apple says the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are fitted with “a new quad LED True Tone Flash with Slow Sync” and we tested it against other top-end phones. In our tests, we found that although Apple’s flash did not shine the brightest, it did provide the most uniform lighting given the right conditions, without flooding a particular object or spot with light. Apple’s implementation of the ‘selfie flash’ where the screen becomes the flash also came out trumps during our tests. There are some changes to the Camera app as well. You can no longer toggle HDR from within the app - it’s set to Auto by default (and is designed to kick in when the ISP feels it’s needed), but you do have the option to turn it off completely by going to Settings > Camera. Apple has also added some new filters to the app for post (and live) processing of photos, if third-party apps like Instagram are not your thing. VerdictStill here? Good, let’s wrap this thing up. Though many have argued that the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus feel like ’S’ upgrades, our experience shows that in many ways they offer more improvements than the jump from the iPhone 6s to iPhone 7 cycle. The camera enhancements are significant, bringing Apple back at the same level as the best in the business in some scenarios, while maintaining, or even extending, its lead in others. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are priced at Rs. 64,000 and Rs. 73,000 respectively for the 64GB variants, with a Rs. 13,000 premium on both if you wish to get the 256GB variants. Though there are a couple of other options in this price bracket, the only other phones worth considering at this price point are Samsung’s flagships Galaxy S8+ and Galaxy Note 8 or the Galaxy S8 and the HTC U11, which are marginally cheaper. If you don’t care about the OS, you could pick any one of these devices and safely call yourself the owner of the best smartphone in the world - software and the Note’s S-Pen aside, there’s very little to choose between these phones. In a world where you can buy a smartphone that’s pretty good on all counts for about a quarter of these prices, we believe flagship smartphones continue to offer an experience that’s unmatched, though the number of people who really need this kind of refinement needs to be examined. If you already have an iPhone and money is no object, you could upgrade to the iPhone 8 or iPhone 8 Plus and be extremely happy, but you’d probably want to wait for the iPhone X for even greater bragging rights. Sadly, we don’t know a lot of people for whom money is not a factor when making buying decisions. The cameras would be the best reason for owners of recent iPhone models to upgrade, and the A11 Bionic chip and wireless charging are welcome additions. However, if you have an iPhone 7 (Plus) or even an iPhone 6s (Plus), you have a phone that’s already fast enough for most tasks. Yes, the newest iPhone models will have an edge when it comes to running ARKit apps, but there are no “must-have” uses cases for AR right now. Wireless charging is a convenience that will one day be fast enough to be practical for all occasions, but that day isn’t here yet. And if you really want, there are ways and means of getting it to work with your existing iPhone as well, like by getting a case that supports wireless charging. If you already have an iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus, you can probably skip the iPhone 8 line (unless having the latest and greatest camera is really important to you), and wait to see what Apple does with its lineup next year: maybe the X design language and features will become available at a more accessible price? We’d give the same advice to iPhone 6s line owners who are happy with their phone - if it ain’t broke, don’t go broke buying an upgrade just for the sake of it. But if you have a previous-generation iPhone that’s starting to feel long in the tooth, you will experience significant gains in all departments by upgrading to the new iPhone models. So who are the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus for, especially in the real world where the prospect of the iPhone X looms large? If you have absolutely no interest in the iPhone X’s design, if you can’t get your head around the idea of the ‘notch’, or can’t afford the phone’s crazy price tag, then you can safely consider its siblings without thinking that you are ‘settling’ for an inferior phone. Yes, you will miss out on what looks like a gorgeous OLED display and other additions like optical image stabilisation on the telephoto lens, but there are plenty of question marks around the iPhone X right now - is Face ID good enough to replace Touch ID? How will the ‘notch’ be incorporated into your favourite applications? We won’t have answers to these questions until we get the chance to test the iPhone X closer to its release in November. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus might seem ‘boring’ in comparison, but with their improved cameras, A11 Bionic chip, wireless charging, and a whole lot more, either one of them could happily be your designated driver for the next couple of years - or until your head is turned by the new ‘X’ in town."

Actually, scratch that. Considering it has internals similar to the iPhone 6s and a design that's identical to the iPhone 5s, the iPhone SE is technically ""old wine in an older bottle"". And while it's true that the iPhone SE does not bring any pathbreaking technical innovations, it does represent a shift in strategy from the Cupertino-based company. The iPhone 5c aside, Apple's ""affordable iPhone"" strategy has been to sell older models at a discount. Whenever a new iPhone old launched, its predecessor moved to the $99 (roughly Rs. 6,500) tier - when phones were still sold at $199 (roughly Rs. 13,100) on contract in the US - while the two-year old model became 'free'. The company followed a similar strategy in other markets, with the addition that while three-year old iPhones would stop typically selling in US and other mature markets, they would continue to be sold in places like India in a bid to reach even lower price points. For example, the iPhone 5s continues to be sold in India even now, and it was going for as low as Rs. 17,000 recently without any exchange offers. Given that background, the $399 (roughly Rs. 26,300) iPhone SE, which costs a full $150 (roughly Rs. 9,900) less than the cheapest new iPhone before this - the cringeworthy 8GB edition doesn't count - represents brand new territory for Apple. With the lower price point, Apple can reach more users, which is significant for the company, what with the talk of iPhone sales flattening out. From the end users' perspective, it's an important step as well, as unlike previous 'cheaper' iPhones, they no longer have to settle for previous generation's hardware (for the most part, as you will discover during the course of this review).    The other market the iPhone SE aims to address is lovers of compact phones. When Apple finally released the iPhone 6 (Review | Pictures) and iPhone 6 Plus (Review | Pictures), they were instant hot sellers due to pent up demand for bigger screen iPhones. But not everyone loves large screen phones. Apple says it sold over 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015 - granted, a large part of those sales may have been driven by the low price tag of the smaller iPhones, but it's safe to say that the 4-inch screen has its fair share of takers as well. If the iPhone SE delivers on its promise, it will surely find takers in India, and elsewhere. So let's take a closer look at Apple's newest iPhone.   Design and displayAs you may already know, the iPhone SE looks identical to the iPhone 5s. If our review unit didn't come in the new Rose Gold colour, it could've easily been mistaken for the iPhone from 2013. We are no fans of antenna lines that feature prominently on the bigger iPhones, so this is one vintage design we have absolutely no complaints about. The iPhone SE is great for one-handed use as you can easily reach all corners of the screen without messing around. As someone who's been using the iPhone 6s Plus as their primary phone for a while, typing on the iPhone SE's smaller screen felt cramped at first, but we got used to it rather quickly, with iOS's autocorrect taking care of the odd typo. The smaller size also makes the iPhone SE extremely light and easily pocketable, especially when compared to the ungainly iPhone 6s Plus, though we admit to missing the extra real estate on offer on the biggest iPhone.    Just like the iPhone 5s, the 4-inch display on the iPhone is not even HD, but you won't notice that while using the device. Text appears sharp and the display is sufficiently bright - we didn't have any trouble using the phone even in direct sunlight. The smaller screen of course isn't great if you watch a lot of videos on your phone. PerformanceThe iPhone SE is powered by the same Apple A9 chip that's inside the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, and it also features 2GB of RAM, though you won't find any mention of that on Apple's website. As you would expect, the phone handled everything we threw at it pretty comfortably. The iPhone SE seemed to work better in low signal areas than the iPhone 6s and the iPhone 6s Plus, but other than that the overall experience was pretty similar to the iPhone 6s.  There are a few key differences though - the iPhone SE does not come with 3D Touch, so you don't get things like Quick Actions and Peek-Pop. While we called out 3D Touch as a technology with a lot of potential when we reviewed the iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus, it's not something we use on an everyday basis on our iPhone 6s Plus just yet, and we think it's unlikely to be missed by most people.   The iPhone SE also comes with slower Touch ID, which may bother some, but it's actually a good thing in our book, as we found the fingerprint scanner to be too fast for its own good, something we documented at length earlier. The iPhone SE also lacks a barometer, which, amongst other things, is used to accurately track how many flights of stairs you have climbed, and is present in iPhone 6 and later models. The difference users may notice the most is that the iPhone SE comes with a 1.2-megapixel f/2.4 front-facing camera (or FaceTime camera as Apple likes to call it), compared to the 5-megapixel f/2.2 in the iPhone 6s. As you would expect, the images captured by this camera lack detail, though the difference may not be visible unless you are viewing them on the big screen. The camera does support Retina Flash, which is easily one of our favourite features of the iPhone SE. Live Photos are supported as well. (Read our review of the iPhone 6s for more details on Retina Flash, Live Photos, iOS 9, and a few other features common between the two phones.)   The rear camera performance of the iPhone SE is identical to the iPhone 6s, which means it's a great camera for most situations with accurate camera reproduction, though the low light performance isn't as good as what you'll get with Samsung's recent phones like the Galaxy S7 or even flagships that are a generation older.   Like its predecessors, the iPhone SE comes with 16GB of storage on the base variant, which is still not ideal, but given the phone's target audience and its positioning in Apple's current lineup of smartphones, it's a little bit more understandable. Having said that, we sincerely hope this is the last iPhone that ships with a 16GB storage option. The iPhone SE clocked over 12 hours of video playback in our battery loop test, which is about 20 percent better than the iPhone 6s. This can be attributed to the smaller, lower resolution display that the iPhone SE ships with. However, in terms of real world usage, we didn't observe much of a difference compared to the iPhone 6s, in that both phones just about manage to last a day of use, while the bigger iPhone 6s Plus easily clocks a day and a bit more.   VerdictIn India, the iPhone SE starts at Rs. 39,000, which may not represent a path-breaking price point that will suddenly make the iPhone accessible to millions more, but it's still an important product for the Indian market. Thanks to the increased flexibility available to Apple's retailers, the MRP is nothing but a guideline, and you should be able to pick it up at a lower price, even without accounting for exchange offers.  The underwhelming front camera aside, the iPhone SE is the complete package, and the overall experience is everything you'd expect from an Apple product. In most ways that we use our iPhone everyday, the iPhone SE is just as good as the iPhone 6s, provided you can live with a smaller screen - and that's something that will ultimately boil down to personal preference. If you are shopping with a fixed budget and don't care which platform you pick, the Samsung Galaxy S6 (Review | Pictures) is available around the same price as the iPhone SE and is easily one our favorite phones from last year."

2272,21,iphone-xr-review-1970658,9,10,2019-04-05,1970658,Kunal Dua,iPhone XR Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/iphone-xr-review-1970658," Apple gave everyone a glimpse at the future of the iPhone with last year's iPhone X, positioning it at the top of its lineup. With a “notch” and Face ID, the iPhone X was the iPhone of the future, and it came with a price tag that required you to pay EMIs well into the future. The iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus were meant to be the more accessible offerings, continuing Apple's “business as usual” model of delivering solid, incremental updates at prices that were only marginally higher than their predecessors. With 2018, however, it seems the future is here, as Apple has gone all-in with the iPhone X (Review) design language across the entire lineup. For the second year in a row, we get not two but three new iPhone models, but this time, they all look pretty much the same — like the iPhone X, but at different sizes. Physically, the iPhone XR sits between the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. It's priced in iPhone 8 Plus territory, which means Apple has eliminated the iPhone 8 (Review) price band altogether. This makes this year's most affordable new iPhone nearly Rs. 13,000 more expensive than last year's point of entry, which seems to be in line with Apple's push to increase prices across all its product categories. It's not all doom and gloom though, as the iPhone XR is available in a variety of colours, to make you forget the hole that buying one is likely to leave in your pocket. While the “most affordable” new iPhone of the year offers more colour options than its more expensive brethren, Apple has removed certain features from the iPhone XR in a bid to keep its cost low. Does this make the iPhone XR a compromised device? That's what we aim to find out in our review. The last time Apple brought colours to the iPhone lineup in any sort of meaningful way was with the poorly received iPhone 5c. Launched alongside the iPhone 5s, the iPhone 5c (Review) — just like the iPhone XR — was the most affordable new iPhone on offer. However, its price tag wasn't as low as everyone expected hoped it would be), and the fact that it shipped with older technology obviously didn't help. Apple has managed to avoid the same trap with the iPhone XR by making sure it ticks the same boxes as its two more expensive siblings, at least as far as the most important specifications are concerned. All three phones are powered by the same SoC, have the same primary rear camera, and come with other modern technologies including Face ID (the iPhone 5c famously missed out on Touch ID, introduced with the iPhone 5s). That's not to say the iPhone XR is just like the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max in every respect. Its frame is made out of “aerospace-grade aluminium” compared to steel on the more expensive iPhone models, though it feels nearly as premium. Both the front and the back of the iPhone XR are all glass, though Apple notes that only the front packs “the most durable glass ever in a smartphone”, so the back has to make do with something less expensive, like the second-most durable glass ever in a smartphone, perhaps. Both the fronts and the backs of the iPhone XS are iPhone XS Max have the aforementioned “most durable glass ever”. The iPhone XR is IP67 rated, just like the iPhone X, while the other two 2018 iPhone models are IP68 rated.    Physically, the iPhone XR sits between the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, and while we believe the iPhone XS form factor is ideal for most people, the iPhone XR represents a possible middle ground for those looking to experiment with a bigger iPhone without stepping up all the way to the iPhone XS Max, which can be rather too much to handle. The iPhone XR is wider than some of today's other popular large-screen Android smartphones and at 194g, it's certainly one of the heavier ones as well. It is also noticeably thicker than the two more premium iPhone models of 2018, and the bezels around its display are a little more pronounced than those of the iPhone XS, though most users won't be be bothered by the latter. Where you will have to settle for last year's technology is the display itself — and it's not even display technology from last year's most expensive iPhone, as the iPhone XR uses the same LCD tech as the iPhone 8. This means you miss out on the richer blacks that the OLED displays on the iPhone X, iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max deliver. The LCD panel offers a lower contrast ratio and lacks HDR as well as Dolby Vision. That in itself isn't a huge deal, but the relatively low resolution (828x1792 pixels at 326ppi) also means that text doesn't look as sharp as it does on some other iPhone models — and, indeed, other smartphones out there. Unless you are making the move from an iPhone 8 or a really inexpensive smartphone, you will almost certainly notice that the quality is, at best, just about good enough. “Just about good enough” is, of course, not what you expect when you pay north of Rs. 75,000 for a smartphone, especially when some phones that cost 10 percent of that amount sport higher-resolution displays. Granted, the panel on the iPhone XR is up there with the best LCD panels in other respects, including viewing angles and colour accuracy, but that doesn't take away from its relatively low resolution.    The other way in which Apple has cut costs is by eliminating 3D Touch. Some people probably won't even notice it's missing given that it wasn't always easy to discover its presence in older iPhone models to begin with. Some popular 3D Touch features such as the keyboard's trackpad mode and the ability to preview notifications have been implemented without 3D Touch, for those who did come to love those little touches. The iPhone XR is available in yellow, white, coral, black, blue, and (Product) Red, which is a welcome change compared to the usual options available from Apple and other manufacturers. While we really appreciated the understated finish of our black review unit, we also quite liked the yellow and blue options in the brief time we spent with them at the global launch event. The iPhone XR is powered by the same Apple A12 Bionic chip inside the iPhone XS duo, so it's no surprise that its performance is pretty similar. It handled everything that we threw at it with aplomb, something we've come to expect from a new iPhone, and indeed other smartphones in this price bracket. PUBG Mobile defaults to the ‘High' frame rate and ‘HD' graphics settings, but we bumped them to ‘Ultra' and ‘HDR' respectively, and playing the game was still a pretty smooth experience. Extended sessions of games such as Asphalt 9: Legends were not a problem either, and we didn't run into any heating issues. Benchmarks show that the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max both have 4GB of RAM, while the iPhone XR has to make do with 3GB of RAM, the same as the iPhone X. While this didn't really prove to be a problem in our experience, it's something to bear in mind if you like your devices to be “future proof”, as would be the case with the more expensive iPhone XS duo. Left to right - iPhone X, iPhone XR, iPhone XS Max   For the first time, iPhones now feature dual-SIM support, but instead of adding a second physical SIM slot, Apple has taken the eSIM route. This means that unless you purchased your iPhone in China, Hong Kong, or Macau — where Apple sells “true” dual-SIM iPhone models — your iPhone XR, iPhone XS, or iPhone XS Max includes an embedded SIM that can be activated as and when desired, in addition to a regular physical SIM slot. In theory, this is meant to make things more convenient by letting you switch from one provider to another without having to swap physical SIMs. In practice, however, it adds an unnecessary level of complication, at least in its current form. For one, only select operators — Jio and Airtel, at the moment — support eSIMs in India. This means that if your second SIM is from Vodafone, Idea, or any other operator, you have no option but to port your number to one of the aforementioned duo, which might not be be possible (or desirable) for everyone. Second, even the operators that do support it, don't make it easy for you to get an eSIM activated. You can't get a new number activated on an eSIM — with both Jio and Airtel, you need to go to a retail store, do the necessary paperwork, get a physical SIM, and then convert it to eSIM so its number can be used with your iPhone. That's like going to your neighbourhood store and mailing yourself what you just purchased to get the “e-commerce” experience. At least some of that is down to India's KYC norms, more than any technological limitations, but from the end user's perspective, the experience is far from ideal. Even if you already have a physical SIM with all KYC procedures completed, Reliance Jio requires (at least at the time of filing this review) you to go to one of its retail units to get your SIM converted to eSIM, which is the next level of bonkers. Thankfully, if you are on Airtel, the experience is a little better. You can initiate the “conversion” of your physical SIM via a text message and then just follow instructions that you will receive via email. We found this part to be relatively hassle-free. As for actually using the iPhone with two SIMs on a daily basis, the experience is pretty much in line with what you get with Android phones. By default, your physical SIM is labelled “Primary” and the eSIM “Secondary”, but you can change these to whatever you like.    You can have multiple “Data Plans” — as Apple calls them — attached to your eSIM, but only one of them can be active can any given time. The term Data Plan, of course, is a little bit misleading, as you can have a voice-only plan as well. You need to designate one of these to be the “Default voice line”, and the same (or the other) needs to be the default line for mobile data. Both lines support 4G at the same time, and the iPhone will let you use mobile data from one line while you are on call using the other. Call history in the Phone app will show a label indicating the line that was used for each call, and tapping the entry will dial that number or contact using the same line. When initiating a new call, you can choose which line to use via a dropdown at the top, with your default line already selected. However, there seems to be no way to choose which line is used when composing a new SMS message, which seems to be a big oversight. Existing conversations in the Messages app will default to using whatever number was used last in that thread. (Edit for clarity: It's possible to choose which outgoing number to use if you've never sent/ received messages from a number, but once a conversation starts, there's no way to change the number being used.) Only one of the two numbers can be associated with iMessage and FaceTime at any given time, which is also a bit of a disappointment. iOS of course also doesn't have the “dual apps” capability that some Android OEMs have added, which means you can run only one instance of apps like WhatsApp, further limiting your dual-SIM experience. You can use either of the numbers with WhatsApp and other services. The iPhone XR offers the same “wider stereo playback” as the more expensive iPhone XS duo, and the resulting sound is pretty impressive. However, the iPhone XR lacks the “Gigabit-class LTE” found in the other two new iPhone models. This might be a problem some day, but that day isn't coming anytime soon given the pitiful state of networks in our country. Though iOS 12 brings a host of new features, the experience using of using an iPhone in countries like India is less than ideal due to the features that apps like Apple Maps lack in these regions, something we've noted time and again. We encourage you to read our iOS 12 review to read our thoughts about new features including Screen Time, Shortcuts, and more that will greatly enhance how you use your iPhone. In terms of battery life, our real-world experience was pretty similar to what we got with iPhone XS Max, in that the iPhone XR easily lasted us a full day, even when our workload was heavier than usual. In our HD video loop test, the iPhone XR lasted an impressive 13 hours and 19 minutes. Though the iPhone XR is “fast-charge capable”, according to Apple, the company provides no fast charger in the box, which is a big disappointment. Wireless charging is supported.    The iPhone used to be the best camera phone in business, but that probably hasn't been the case since the days of the iPhone 6 Plus. It started with companies like Samsung taking a lead in low-light camera performance, and since then we've seen the likes of Huawei and Google surpass Apple when it comes to building a phone that's a solid overall performer when it comes to still photography. Google has been somewhat of a flag bearer in this department with its Pixel range of flagships. While all three generations of Pixel phones might have been plagued by a host of reliability issues, there's been no denying their photography chops. Even as other manufactures have relied on two, three, and even four sensors in a bid to deliver better image quality — often with mixed results — Google has stuck to a single sensor, while doubling down on machine learning algorithms to enhance the resulting images. Given Google's success with this approach, it's no surprise to see Apple and others go down the same path, even if it seems that Cupertino is merely dipping its toes instead of going all-in. While the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max continue to feature dual rear cameras, the iPhone XR packs only one sensor at the back. This, pardon the pun, serves dual purposes. First, it obviously reduces the cost of the more “affordable” iPhone XR, but more importantly, it gives Apple a device with which it can experiment a bit with its machine learning approach to photography. As we noted in our iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max review, the more expensive duo also rely on machine learning in the form of Smart HDR to deliver great images, but the iPhone XR takes this a step further. Similar to the Google Pixel 3 and a bunch of other phones, the iPhone XR uses machine learning to offer Portrait Mode with the rear camera, which was earlier limited to iPhone models with dual rear cameras. Even with a single rear camera, the iPhone XR does a good job when it comes to edge detection and the Bokeh effect in portrait mode, but it's not as good as the results we saw with the iPhone XS. We also noticed that some portraits taken with the iPhone XR had less detail compared to similar shots taken by the iPhone XS. Tap to see ful-sized iPhone XR camera samples   In the absence of a telephoto lens with 2X zoom, we noticed that we needed to be physically closer (than with the iPhone X/ XS/ XS Max) to the subjects of our shots to activate portrait mode. The resulting shots are actually wider, since the standard lens is being used rather than a narrow telephoto lens. You do get Portrait Lighting modes as well, though you are limited to three modes — Natural, Studio, and Contour — with Stage and Stage Mono still exclusive to iPhone models with dual rear cameras. Also note that portrait mode on the iPhone XR will work best with humans and not animals or objects, since the machine learning algorithms have been optimised for the former. In all respects aside from the obviously missing 2x telephoto lens, the performance of the iPhone XR's camera is identical to that of the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, which is to say it's now up there with the best in the business. Read our reviews of the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, as well as our comparison of the iPhone XS with some of today's best Android smartphone cameras, for more details. VerdictLet's go back to the question that we started with: is the iPhone XR a compromised device? It isn't; not in ways that would matter to most users. While we are not fans of its display, it does its job without being particularly great. In other areas such as performance and camera quality, the iPhone XR more than holds its own, and is a match for the more expensive iPhone models as well as other flagship phones. That brings us to its price. We've made it abundantly clear that we are not fans of the upward trend that we've seen across the entire range of Apple products. As we noted in our iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max review, even with the promise of regular software updates and better resale value, it's getting increasingly difficult to justify the price tags that Apple's phones command. With a starting price of Rs. 76,900, the iPhone XR isn't exactly a bargain, but it's better value for money than the iPhone XS, and certainly the iPhone XS Max. Heck, even the speaker grille at the bottom is symmetrical, so it shows no one was napping at the wheels while designing this one. Though Apple has discontinued the iPhone X in some markets, it's still very much around in India and available at pretty much the same starting price as the iPhone XR. As much as love the display on the iPhone X, the camera improvements that Smart HDR brings tilt the balance in favour of the newer iPhone, which also brings other niceties like dual-SIM support and a faster processor. The iPhone X is only for those who truly value the deeper blacks on the AMOLED display or are put off by the size of the iPhone XR, and cannot afford the iPhone XS. If you don't mind looking beyond the iPhone, recent months have seen the launch of plenty of great Android flagships including the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (Review) and Huawei Mate 20 Pro (Review), as well as a host of other phones earlier in the year. Or you could go pick up a “value flagship” like the OnePlus 6T (Review) and save a bunch of money in the process. With that said, a new round of Android flagships is just around the corner as well, so you won't have to wait too long if nothing catches your fancy right now."
2273,21,iphone-xs-review-iphone-xs-max-1970657,9,10,2018-12-31,1970657,Kunal Dua,iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/iphone-xs-review-iphone-xs-max-1970657," If you watched this year's iPhone launch event, you could've been forgiven for thinking that the iPhone XS is the most underwhelming 'S' upgrade in the iPhone's history. Apple spent surprisingly little time talking about the new features of the flagship iPhone models — a lot more information has come out since, which makes them seem like bigger upgrades than one had initially thought. Not many realise that while the 'S' cycle of iPhone models represents no major changes in design language, historically, we've seen some significant features introduced. Siri, Touch ID, 3D Touch, and even the M-series of motion coprocessors all debuted in an iPhone 'S'. Of this year's two new 'S' models, the iPhone XS Max can at least claim to be the biggest iPhone till date — packing a 6.5-inch display in a body that's marginally smaller than that of the 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus (Review) — but, on the face of it, the iPhone XS certainly seems to lack the kind of headline feature found in many of the previous 'S' models. So is the iPhone XS really the most underwhelming S upgrade in the iPhone's decade-long history, or does it pack improvements that Apple just didn't talk about during the keynote? Is the iPhone XS Max too large for its own good, or does the most expensive iPhone till date also represent the most perfect form of the smartphone? Let's answer these questions and more. The iPhone XS has exactly the same dimensions as last year's iPhone X (Review), though it's 3g heavier. We loved the iPhone X's design, so we have no complaints with the fact that Apple has decided to stick to what's clearly been a popular choice with consumers as well. However, the camera bump on the iPhone XS is a tiny bit bigger than the one on the iPhone X. Physically, the iPhone XS Max is pretty much the same size as the iPhone 8 Plus, so if you are someone who's used a Plus-sized iPhone before, you will be right at home with the size. With that said, at 208g, the iPhone XS Max is the heaviest phone Apple has ever made, and it certainly makes its presence felt. While not that much heavier than the iPhone 8 Plus (202g), the iPhone XS Max is quite a jump if you are coming from any other model or generation. It's safe to say that not everyone will be fan of this extra weight, but we got used to it pretty quickly. What we struggle with even after using the phone for a couple of months is reaching the upper corners of the screen. By getting rid of the Home button and the bezel above the screen, Apple has managed to squeeze a 6.5-inch display on the iPhone XS Max, giving you an extra inch compared to previous Plus-sized phones.    While the extra real estate is great, it's even more difficult to reach the upper corners of the screen — especially the upper right corner, which you need to do bring down Control Centre, a pretty common operation. You'll need to perform a little juggle to move the phone in your hand, or as will likely be the case for many people, involve the other hand. The Reachability gesture to pull down the home screen that we mentioned in our iPhone X review is still there, but it requires the kind of precision that is almost impossible to achieve, especially if you are worried about balancing your phone. Of course the iPhone XS Max is not alone in this regard, and this is a problem with large phones in the Android world as well. What's disappointing is that Apple has done little to make use of the additional real estate by adding extra software features. For example, we would've loved a picture-in-picture mode for videos or Apple Maps navigation — which sadly remains unavailable in India, but more on that later — or, for example, the ability to watch videos on the home screen, or on top of other apps, similar to what we have on the iPad. You do get a multi-column layout in landscape mode in apps like Messages and Mail, but it's utility is questionable at best, especially when you consider that just like the iPhone X, the iPhone XS, and iPhone XS Max do not support landscape mode on the home screen. Apple says the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max have “the most durable glass ever in a smartphone on the front and back”, but, as ever, the company is silent on what type of glass is being used. The all-glass front and back are held together by “surgical-grade” stainless steel bands in between, and the overall finish is everything you'd expect from an iPhone and more. What we didn't expect from an iPhone is the asymmetrical speaker grilles at the bottom. The left side has fewer holes than the right, and surely we can't be the only ones who find this a little bit problematic. This is a strange move indeed for a company that's often compromised usability for symmetry and perfect visual design. This would have never happened under...   The iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max are available in a new Gold finish, in addition to the Silver and Space Grey options we saw with the iPhone X. All three finishes look good in our opinion, and the Gold should be your pick if you want something that will stand out. Of course most people will end up putting a hideous case on their iPhone, so what colour they pick doesn't really matter to begin with. In our iPhone X review, we called its display “arguably the best we've ever come across on a smartphone”. The iPhone XS has the same panel with HDR10 and Dolby Vision support. Apple's True Tone technology, which is designed to adjust white balance on screen to match ambient light conditions, is present as well. It also has a wide colour gamut and a million-to-one contrast ratio. The display on the iPhone XS Max shares all these characteristics with its smaller sibling. That includes the 458ppi density, which means the bigger model has a higher resolution panel to compensate for the increased size. A year after the launch of the iPhone X, we still have no complaints with its display in terms of brightness, viewing angles, or colour reproduction, and the displays on the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max continue to be up there with the best in the business. Watching videos is a pretty immersive experience, especially on the bigger iPhone XS Max. Yes, the notch is still very much there, and unlike some Android smartphone makers, Apple doesn't give you a way to disable it at the expense of losing some real estate. But, thankfully, third-party iOS apps seem to be in much better shape than their Android counterparts, and we haven't really come across apps where the notch proved to be an issue. As we've said before, Apple's SoC division perhaps doesn't get enough credit for the work it has done in a relatively small amount of time. Though the iPhone has packed some Apple-designed chips in one form or another since its debut in 2007, the iPhone 4 was the first to be powered by an A-series CPU that's Apple best-known for. While the first wave of A-series chips were certainly competitive, they now set the benchmark in terms of performance. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 has been the SoC of choice as far as most of 2018's Android flagships were concerned, and its performance in certain benchmarks still falls short of last year's A11 chip. This, despite the fact that the first Snapdragon 845-powered phones didn't ship nearly six months after the A11-powered iPhone 8, which is a lifetime in the world of technology. The A12 chip inside all three 2018 iPhone models further extends Apple's lead in this department, with benchmark scores well above what Android flagships have delivered this year, and comfortably ahead of last year's iPhone models as well. It will be interesting to see whether the Snapdragon 855, which is just on the horizon, manages to bridge this gap. As you would expect, there are absolutely no performance issues when it comes to day-to-day tasks on the new iPhone models. Gaming is a breeze, and even demanding titles such as PUBG Mobile and Asphalt 9 are playable at their highest settings without any issues. For the first time, you can get an iPhone with 512GB storage, though be prepared to pay through the roof for that privilege. Though Apple doesn't officially disclose the amount of RAM in iOS devices, benchmarks reveal that the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max both pack 4GB of RAM, which is the most we've seen on an iPhone to date. The iPhone XR has to settle for 3GB of RAM. From left to right - iPhone X, iPhone XR, iPhone XS Max   Talking about the iPhone XR, the iPhone finally gets dual-SIM support via eSIM, and if you are wondering what experience is like, we encourage you to read our iPhone XR review where we cover that topic in depth. In short, the experience is not as simple and convenient as the ability to swap physical SIMs in and out of your device. The iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max are now IP68-rated for dust and water resistance, an improvement compared to the iPhone X and even iPhone XR. Also new is support for Gigabit-class LTE, even though we in India haven't come close to maxing out the 4G speeds supported by much slower phones. Both the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max will last you through a full workday without many troubles, though the latter is much more likely to survive heavier workloads without making you reach for a charger. On most regular days, the iPhone XS Max should easily have anywhere between 20 and 30 percent left in the tank at the end of the day. In our HD video loop test, the iPhone XS Max lasted 11 hours and 15 minutes, while the iPhone XS ran out of juice 25 minutes sooner.    Though the new iPhone models do support fast charging — Apple claims the battery can be charged “up to 50 percent in 30 minutes” — you'll need to buy a 18W charger separately, which is not something you'll want to do when you've spent nearly a lakh on a phone — or more, in case of the iPhone XS Max. We've called this out in our earlier iPhone reviews as well, and it's sad to see Apple still ship a 5W charger with a smartphone in 2018. Just like last year's iPhone models, all three 2018 iPhones support wireless charging as well. The new iPhone models also support wider stereo playback, which makes watching videos or listening to music a better experience. The speakers on both iPhone models get sufficiently loud and the output isn't distorted even at maximum volume. Apple claims the newer iPhone models ship with a slightly faster Face ID implementation, but we didn't really notice any difference compared to the iPhone X. That's not necessarily a bad thing, since we didn't have any complaints with Face ID to begin with — not in terms of its speed, accuracy, or the security it offers. The new iPhone models ship with iOS 12, and we've covered in-depth the new features that the latest version of iOS brings. As for the experience using these new features, since it's pretty much identical on the iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPhone XR, we've covered that separately in our iOS 12 review, which we encourage you to read before proceeding further. Arguably the biggest jump that the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max bring is in terms of camera performance. The wide-angle sensor is 32 percent bigger than that of the iPhone X, but the biggest improvements come via software, specifically a feature that Apple is calling Smart HDR. According to Apple, Smart HDR leverages multiple technologies like the bigger, faster sensors, an improved image signal processor (ISP), and advanced machine learning algorithms to bring “more highlight and shadow detail to your photos”. Colour us impressed, because the resulting images are greatly improved compared to the iPhone X. This finally puts the iPhone camera back in the same league as the big boys. In our experience, Smart HDR worked best for landscape shots, and some of the photos that we managed to take with the iPhone XS Max were simply stunning, if we do say so ourselves. Shots featuring water bodies like the ocean or lakes came out looking especially good, with plenty of detail and great colour accuracy. Tap to see full-sized iPhone XS Max camera samples   Smart HDR also makes it possible to capture shots that would otherwise be a bad idea. Time and again, we took pictures looking straight at the Sun or other light sources in the frame — defying conventional rules of photography — and still ended up with pretty good looking shorts. Low-light performance, which had been a bit of a problem for Apple in recent years, is greatly improved as well, though the iPhone lacks a Night-Sight like party trick. Portrait mode is excellent with both, the front and rear cameras. A recent software update has fixed the “beautygate” scandal that marred the iPhone XS' selfie camera upon release, so a complaint that some might have had is gone. New depth controls let you adjust the depth-of-field of your portrait shots after they've been taken, which is a welcome touch. When it comes to shooting videos, the iPhone has consistently been at the top of the charts in our camera comparison tests, and the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max are no different. Like before, you can shoot 4K at up to 60fps, a feature still lacking in some popular Android flagships. If you are shooting at 30fps or higher, a new setting — enabled by default — allows the iPhone to dynamically drop down the frame rate to 24fps to let in more light when shooting in poorly lit conditions, which should improve the quality of your videos. All three new iPhone models support now stereo recording as well. We encourage you to read our in-depth comparison of the iPhone XS with other leading camera phones to see where it stands compared to some of the other top-rated camera phones out there (spoiler alert: we found it to be the best all-around camera phone out there). VerdictThe biggest Apple related trend we saw in 2018 was increased prices across the entire line of products. Be it the iPad, MacBook Air, Mac mini, or indeed the iPhone, all Apple products and accessories cost a lot more today than their equivalents 12 months ago. With unit sales plateauing, some analysts believe this is down to Apple's focus on increasing the average selling price of each product. Granted, nearly all the products we mentioned above feature some significant upgrades compared to their predecessors, but that's the nature of hardware products — they evolve over time — and these improvements don't always need to be accompanied by a price increase. That's especially the case for a company like Apple whose products aren't priced at the bottom-end of the bargain bin to begin with. The iPhone X apparently cost a premium because it gave us a glimpse of the future, allowing Apple to charge an “early-adopter” premium, if you will. But a year later, with a starting price of Rs. 99,900, the iPhone XS costs even more than the iPhone X did at its launch in India. The iPhone XS Max — Rs. 1,44,900 for the top-end variant — takes pricing to ridiculous territory. It's easy to say that least some of this is due to reasons beyond Apple's control, like the rupee's fate against the US dollar and the tariffs that the Indian government has placed on imported phones. But the truth is that all OEMs operate under the same market conditions, and everyone else seems to have adapted by moving majority of their manufacturing (read assembling) to India, while not being afraid to keep their margins low in order to keep their products accessible for the average Indian consumer. Now no one's suggesting Apple go down the Xiaomi route, but the company is in desperate need to rethink its entire India strategy. This includes, among other things, moving assembly of all iPhone models to India — which finally seems to be happening — and improving the experience of key Apple services like Maps and Siri.    It's true that the iPhone holds its value better than any other phone, and Apple's record in terms of pushing regular software updates even to older devices is unparalleled, which means your iPhone will continue to get new features over time. Theoretically, this means even if you spend a little extra today, you can use the iPhone for longer than you might want to with an Android phone, and still have a pretty good experience. In practice though, there's always something nice and shiny around the corner to tempt you to upgrade. The iPhone 7 (Review) from two years ago looks pretty dated compared to even the iPhone XR, leave alone the iPhone XS. So while you can pay a premium up front and continue to use your iPhone for several years, the truth is that towards the second half of its life, your device will be really behind the curve. It's no surprise then that “value flagships” such as the OnePlus 6T (Review) are becoming increasingly popular, offering people most of the bells and whistles of a flagship phone, while keeping the price tag low enough that people don't mind upgrading to a new model every one or two years. Apple seems confident that it can buck this trend, and as great as the new iPhone XS models are — the performance is best in class, cameras are finally as good as the competition, and despite iOS' limitations, you are guaranteed software updates — it's difficult to really recommend them to anyone who isn't swimming in money. If you identify yourself as someone who does just that, the only question for you is which one should you get — the iPhone XS or the iPhone XS Max? If you've ever used a Plus-sized iPhone before, or if you are already using a large screen Android smartphone, you will be right at home with the iPhone XS Max. For everyone else, though, it might be a step too far, and the iPhone XS is the way to go. On the other hand, if you don't have access to unlimited funds, you should seriously give the iPhone XR a look. Despite lacking a few features of its more expensive brethren, it isn't a compromised device by any means. Read our iPhone XR review to decide if it should be your next smartphone."
1767,21,lenovo-k6-note-review-1641053,7,10,2016-12-27,1641053,Ketan Pratap,Lenovo K6 Note Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/lenovo-k6-note-review-1641053," Lenovo launched the K6 Power in India last month, in an attempt to strengthen its portfolio in the sub-Rs. 10,000 segment. Considering that the company introduced the entire K6 series - Lenovo K6, K6 Power, and K6 Note - at IFA earlier this year, we're not surprised to see that the next model is already here. The all-new Lenovo K6 Note is the company's first K-series smartphone to be available exclusively via offline channels, and the company claims that it will be available at 15,000 retail stores in the country. Lenovo also plans to promote the K6 Note heavily for the Tier 1 and Tier 2 markets in India. The K6 Note offers an all-metal body and some decent specifications. The company is also marketing its TheaterMax technology for virtual reality, and Dolby Atmos on the K6 Note. Will the Lenovo K6 Note able to compete with some of the favourites in this segment? We try to find out in our review.    Lenovo K6 Note look and feelWhen the all-new K6 Note arrived at our office, we first mistook it for another K6 Power (Review) unit, because the two have nearly identical boxes. Lenovo told us that the similar retail packaging for the K6 series is intentional. At first glance, the front of the K6 Note also looks similar to the K6 Power, though the screen size is obviously a big differentiator. There is definitely a lot of consistency between the siblings in terms of design. There are capacitive navigation buttons just below the display, and the volume and power buttons are on the side. The capacitive buttons for navigation do not have backlighting, something we complained about with the K6 Power as well. The hybrid SIM tray, which can fit either two SIMs or one SIM and one microSD card, is on the left. The 3.5mm audio jack is on top, while there are two speaker grilles on either side of a Micro-USB port on the bottom. At almost 170 grams, the Lenovo K6 Note initially felt heavy for its size, but after using it for a few days, we got used to it. The all-metal design means that the handset feels sturdy, but the rear is also slippery. During our review, we had to be careful while using the K6 Note, especially if our hands were sweaty. Despite the screen size, we were comfortable using this smartphone with just one hand. The front is dominated by the 5.5-inch display. The back of the K6 Note is where we see the most differences compared to the smaller K6 Power. Straightaway, we see a slight bulge for the rear camera with its dual-LED flash. This did look slightly odd and we wish that it could have been flush with the rear of the phone. While using the K6 Note, we found that the rear camera lens was susceptible to scratches.  The round fingerprint scanner is located right below the rear camera and flash. Two gold lines frame the top and bottom of the phone, and there's some company branding towards the bottom as well. The 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920-pixel) IPS display on the K6 Note is vibrant and produces really sharp text and colours. The brightness is decent for outdoor use. There is no protection such as Corning Gorilla Glass for the display which seems like a potential weakness considering that competitors do offer this. Compared to the K6 Power, the K6 Note's bigger screen makes it better for watching videos and playing games. Overall, the Lenovo K6 Note felt sturdy. The phone ships with a headset, a power adaptor, a Micro-USB data cable, a warranty card, and a user manual. Lenovo K6 Note specifications and featuresThe Lenovo K6 Note has the same Snapdragon 430 processor clocked at 1.4GHz as the K6 Power, and we would have preferred something a bit more capable. There are two variants of this phone, one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The former has hit our market first - and is also the one we are reviewing today - with Lenovo saying that the second one will be available soon. The smartphone supports expandable storage via microSD card (up to 128GB). The K6 Note sports a 16-megapixel rear camera with PDAF (phase detection autofocus) and a dual-LED flash. At the front, the K6 Note retains the same 8-megapixel front camera seen on the K6 Power. Connectivity options on the handset include 4G with VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, and GPS. The K6 Note also includes an accelerometer, gyroscope, proximity sensor, and digital compass. On the software front, the Lenovo K6 Note runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Lenovo's Vibe Pure UI on top. We liked using it on the K6 Power, and it's still good. Other software features are common across the models as well, including the app lock functionality that allows users to lock any app behind a fingerprint; Dual Apps mode, which lets users have two WhatsApp and other accounts on the same phone; and Fingerprint Snap, which lets the fingerprint sensor act as an alternative shutter button. Overall, Vibe Pure UI is smooth and feels fast with only a small amount of bloatware. (Also see: Lenovo's AntVR Headset Is Easy to Use, for VR or Basic Big-Screen Fun) With the K6 Note, Lenovo is once again promoting its TheaterMax technology and ANT VR headset, which was initially launched with the Lenovo Vibe K4 Note (Review) at the beginning of 2016. The headset basically allows users to experience media such as movies, games, and other content with a 100-degree field of view which is almost equivalent to a cinematic experience. It is however worth mentioning that users will have to buy the Ant VR headset separately from Amazon India. We tried the new K6 Note with an Ant VR headset and it worked as intended. One can enable VR mode by long-pressing the power button, or from within the Settings app.  Considering that the Ant VR headset is fairly inexpensive and is built well, the K6 Note offers users a chance to experience VR without spending a bomb. We will however reiterate that Lenovo needs to forge partnerships with content creators to push virtual reality support on its smartphones. For now, users can only experience movies, videos, and some games. Lenovo K6 Note performanceDespite featuring a mid-range Snapdragon 430 processor, the K6 Note was fast enough for our daily requirements. We didn't experience lag while multitasking or while flipping through multiple apps. Games like Dead Trigger 2 and Plants vs. Zombies 2 worked smoothly. We however noticed slowdowns during video calls on WhatsApp, Skype, and Google Duo, which was unexpected considering that we were using a fast Wi-Fi connection. We got 44,217 in AnTuTu, which was way above the Lenovo K6 Power's score of 27,372 and the Redmi 3S Prime's 40,250. All three phones are powered by the same Snapdragon 430 processor. We also observed scores of 15fps in GFXbench, 21,063 in Quadrant, and 5.601 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme. The fingerprint scanner at the back was quick, and unlocked the device even when in standby. Watching videos, movies, and games on the K6 Note was a treat, and the Dolby Atmos audio enhancement makes a noticeable difference. However, we were disappointed with the bundled earphones, which were below average. The Lenovo K6 Note supports VoLTE (voice over LTE) on both SIMs and we didn't experience any call drops due to handset issues. The Lenovo K6 Note's camera does a good job when it comes to casual everyday shots. The 16-megapixel sensor with PDAF is quick to lock focus. The Smart Composition tool tries to help in different situations, but can be turned off in the camera settings. The app offers various modes including Pro, Panorama, Nightscape, HDR, Fast-motion, and Slow-motion. We especially liked the Fast-motion and Slow-motion features as they increased and decreased the subject's speed. We would have liked the ability to turn these clips into GIFs - other manufacturers such as Gionee have started adding support for GIF creation in their camera apps. Tap to see full-sized Lenovo K6 Note camera samples The camera interface is easy to use, and we managed to take some good detailed landscape shots. Macros also appear with decent colour accuracy and details. Images taken in daylight could have been sharper, and edges tended to have noticeable noise when seen on a larger screen. In some shots taken under direct sunlight, we noticed that colours were washed out. We were impressed with low-light shots. Even in the dark, the camera was able to hold a subject in focus, which is good. Selfies on the K6 Note were decent for sharing casually on social media, but not very impressive overall. We managed to get 13 hours and 20 minutes of playback time in our HD video loop test, which is decent for a battery of this size. The Lenovo K6 Power, with its smaller display, managed more playback time. In everyday usage with both SIMs active, the K6 Note easily managed to last over a day. It supports fast charging though Lenovo is not promoting this feature. We found that 30 minutes of charging filled the battery up to 50 percent, and the device could be charged fully in under 100 minutes. VerdictLenovo is one of the many companies in India that have invested heavily in establishing an online sales presence, and several models in the recent past have been online exclusives. With its new K6 Note however, the company wants to reach customers who like purchasing phones offline. The K6 Note offers a large screen and a basic VR experience through the affordable Ant VR headset, which is a great feature even if it isn't always practical. We like this phone's build quality and display, but we still would have liked a more powerful SoC. Starting at Rs. 13,999, the Lenovo K6 Note will be competing against the similarly priced Moto G4 Plus (Review) and will also have to fend off the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (Review) which is priced lower and offers good overall performance."

The 5.5-inch full-HD (1080x1920-pixel) IPS display on the K6 Note is vibrant and produces really sharp text and colours. The brightness is decent for outdoor use. There is no protection such as Corning Gorilla Glass for the display which seems like a potential weakness considering that competitors do offer this. Compared to the K6 Power, the K6 Note's bigger screen makes it better for watching videos and playing games. Overall, the Lenovo K6 Note felt sturdy. The phone ships with a headset, a power adaptor, a Micro-USB data cable, a warranty card, and a user manual. Lenovo K6 Note specifications and featuresThe Lenovo K6 Note has the same Snapdragon 430 processor clocked at 1.4GHz as the K6 Power, and we would have preferred something a bit more capable. There are two variants of this phone, one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The former has hit our market first - and is also the one we are reviewing today - with Lenovo saying that the second one will be available soon. The smartphone supports expandable storage via microSD card (up to 128GB). The K6 Note sports a 16-megapixel rear camera with PDAF (phase detection autofocus) and a dual-LED flash. At the front, the K6 Note retains the same 8-megapixel front camera seen on the K6 Power. Connectivity options on the handset include 4G with VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, and GPS. The K6 Note also includes an accelerometer, gyroscope, proximity sensor, and digital compass. On the software front, the Lenovo K6 Note runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Lenovo's Vibe Pure UI on top. We liked using it on the K6 Power, and it's still good. Other software features are common across the models as well, including the app lock functionality that allows users to lock any app behind a fingerprint; Dual Apps mode, which lets users have two WhatsApp and other accounts on the same phone; and Fingerprint Snap, which lets the fingerprint sensor act as an alternative shutter button. Overall, Vibe Pure UI is smooth and feels fast with only a small amount of bloatware. (Also see: Lenovo's AntVR Headset Is Easy to Use, for VR or Basic Big-Screen Fun) With the K6 Note, Lenovo is once again promoting its TheaterMax technology and ANT VR headset, which was initially launched with the Lenovo Vibe K4 Note (Review) at the beginning of 2016. The headset basically allows users to experience media such as movies, games, and other content with a 100-degree field of view which is almost equivalent to a cinematic experience. It is however worth mentioning that users will have to buy the Ant VR headset separately from Amazon India. We tried the new K6 Note with an Ant VR headset and it worked as intended. One can enable VR mode by long-pressing the power button, or from within the Settings app.  Considering that the Ant VR headset is fairly inexpensive and is built well, the K6 Note offers users a chance to experience VR without spending a bomb. We will however reiterate that Lenovo needs to forge partnerships with content creators to push virtual reality support on its smartphones. For now, users can only experience movies, videos, and some games. Lenovo K6 Note performanceDespite featuring a mid-range Snapdragon 430 processor, the K6 Note was fast enough for our daily requirements. We didn't experience lag while multitasking or while flipping through multiple apps. Games like Dead Trigger 2 and Plants vs. Zombies 2 worked smoothly. We however noticed slowdowns during video calls on WhatsApp, Skype, and Google Duo, which was unexpected considering that we were using a fast Wi-Fi connection. We got 44,217 in AnTuTu, which was way above the Lenovo K6 Power's score of 27,372 and the Redmi 3S Prime's 40,250. All three phones are powered by the same Snapdragon 430 processor. We also observed scores of 15fps in GFXbench, 21,063 in Quadrant, and 5.601 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme. The fingerprint scanner at the back was quick, and unlocked the device even when in standby. Watching videos, movies, and games on the K6 Note was a treat, and the Dolby Atmos audio enhancement makes a noticeable difference. However, we were disappointed with the bundled earphones, which were below average. The Lenovo K6 Note supports VoLTE (voice over LTE) on both SIMs and we didn't experience any call drops due to handset issues. The Lenovo K6 Note's camera does a good job when it comes to casual everyday shots. The 16-megapixel sensor with PDAF is quick to lock focus. The Smart Composition tool tries to help in different situations, but can be turned off in the camera settings. The app offers various modes including Pro, Panorama, Nightscape, HDR, Fast-motion, and Slow-motion. We especially liked the Fast-motion and Slow-motion features as they increased and decreased the subject's speed. We would have liked the ability to turn these clips into GIFs - other manufacturers such as Gionee have started adding support for GIF creation in their camera apps. Tap to see full-sized Lenovo K6 Note camera samples The camera interface is easy to use, and we managed to take some good detailed landscape shots. Macros also appear with decent colour accuracy and details. Images taken in daylight could have been sharper, and edges tended to have noticeable noise when seen on a larger screen. In some shots taken under direct sunlight, we noticed that colours were washed out. We were impressed with low-light shots. Even in the dark, the camera was able to hold a subject in focus, which is good. Selfies on the K6 Note were decent for sharing casually on social media, but not very impressive overall. We managed to get 13 hours and 20 minutes of playback time in our HD video loop test, which is decent for a battery of this size. The Lenovo K6 Power, with its smaller display, managed more playback time. In everyday usage with both SIMs active, the K6 Note easily managed to last over a day. It supports fast charging though Lenovo is not promoting this feature. We found that 30 minutes of charging filled the battery up to 50 percent, and the device could be charged fully in under 100 minutes. VerdictLenovo is one of the many companies in India that have invested heavily in establishing an online sales presence, and several models in the recent past have been online exclusives. With its new K6 Note however, the company wants to reach customers who like purchasing phones offline. The K6 Note offers a large screen and a basic VR experience through the affordable Ant VR headset, which is a great feature even if it isn't always practical. We like this phone's build quality and display, but we still would have liked a more powerful SoC. Starting at Rs. 13,999, the Lenovo K6 Note will be competing against the similarly priced Moto G4 Plus (Review) and will also have to fend off the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (Review) which is priced lower and offers good overall performance."

Considering that the company introduced the entire K6 series - Lenovo K6, K6 Power, and K6 Note - at IFA earlier this year, we're not surprised to see that the next model is already here. The all-new Lenovo K6 Note is the company's first K-series smartphone to be available exclusively via offline channels, and the company claims that it will be available at 15,000 retail stores in the country. Lenovo also plans to promote the K6 Note heavily for the Tier 1 and Tier 2 markets in India. The K6 Note offers an all-metal body and some decent specifications. The company is also marketing its TheaterMax technology for virtual reality, and Dolby Atmos on the K6 Note. Will the Lenovo K6 Note able to compete with some of the favourites in this segment? We try to find out in our review.    Lenovo K6 Note look and feelWhen the all-new K6 Note arrived at our office, we first mistook it for another K6 Power (Review) unit, because the two have nearly identical boxes. Lenovo told us that the similar retail packaging for the K6 series is intentional. At first glance, the front of the K6 Note also looks similar to the K6 Power, though the screen size is obviously a big differentiator. There is definitely a lot of consistency between the siblings in terms of design. There are capacitive navigation buttons just below the display, and the volume and power buttons are on the side. The capacitive buttons for navigation do not have backlighting, something we complained about with the K6 Power as well. The hybrid SIM tray, which can fit either two SIMs or one SIM and one microSD card, is on the left. The 3.5mm audio jack is on top, while there are two speaker grilles on either side of a Micro-USB port on the bottom. At almost 170 grams, the Lenovo K6 Note initially felt heavy for its size, but after using it for a few days, we got used to it. The all-metal design means that the handset feels sturdy, but the rear is also slippery. During our review, we had to be careful while using the K6 Note, especially if our hands were sweaty. Despite the screen size, we were comfortable using this smartphone with just one hand. The front is dominated by the 5.5-inch display. The back of the K6 Note is where we see the most differences compared to the smaller K6 Power. Straightaway, we see a slight bulge for the rear camera with its dual-LED flash. This did look slightly odd and we wish that it could have been flush with the rear of the phone. While using the K6 Note, we found that the rear camera lens was susceptible to scratches.

Lenovo K6 Note performanceDespite featuring a mid-range Snapdragon 430 processor, the K6 Note was fast enough for our daily requirements. We didn't experience lag while multitasking or while flipping through multiple apps. Games like Dead Trigger 2 and Plants vs. Zombies 2 worked smoothly. We however noticed slowdowns during video calls on WhatsApp, Skype, and Google Duo, which was unexpected considering that we were using a fast Wi-Fi connection. We got 44,217 in AnTuTu, which was way above the Lenovo K6 Power's score of 27,372 and the Redmi 3S Prime's 40,250. All three phones are powered by the same Snapdragon 430 processor. We also observed scores of 15fps in GFXbench, 21,063 in Quadrant, and 5.601 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme. The fingerprint scanner at the back was quick, and unlocked the device even when in standby. Watching videos, movies, and games on the K6 Note was a treat, and the Dolby Atmos audio enhancement makes a noticeable difference. However, we were disappointed with the bundled earphones, which were below average. The Lenovo K6 Note supports VoLTE (voice over LTE) on both SIMs and we didn't experience any call drops due to handset issues. The Lenovo K6 Note's camera does a good job when it comes to casual everyday shots. The 16-megapixel sensor with PDAF is quick to lock focus. The Smart Composition tool tries to help in different situations, but can be turned off in the camera settings. The app offers various modes including Pro, Panorama, Nightscape, HDR, Fast-motion, and Slow-motion. We especially liked the Fast-motion and Slow-motion features as they increased and decreased the subject's speed. We would have liked the ability to turn these clips into GIFs - other manufacturers such as Gionee have started adding support for GIF creation in their camera apps. Tap to see full-sized Lenovo K6 Note camera samples The camera interface is easy to use, and we managed to take some good detailed landscape shots. Macros also appear with decent colour accuracy and details. Images taken in daylight could have been sharper, and edges tended to have noticeable noise when seen on a larger screen. In some shots taken under direct sunlight, we noticed that colours were washed out. We were impressed with low-light shots. Even in the dark, the camera was able to hold a subject in focus, which is good. Selfies on the K6 Note were decent for sharing casually on social media, but not very impressive overall. We managed to get 13 hours and 20 minutes of playback time in our HD video loop test, which is decent for a battery of this size. The Lenovo K6 Power, with its smaller display, managed more playback time. In everyday usage with both SIMs active, the K6 Note easily managed to last over a day. It supports fast charging though Lenovo is not promoting this feature. We found that 30 minutes of charging filled the battery up to 50 percent, and the device could be charged fully in under 100 minutes. VerdictLenovo is one of the many companies in India that have invested heavily in establishing an online sales presence, and several models in the recent past have been online exclusives. With its new K6 Note however, the company wants to reach customers who like purchasing phones offline. The K6 Note offers a large screen and a basic VR experience through the affordable Ant VR headset, which is a great feature even if it isn't always practical. We like this phone's build quality and display, but we still would have liked a more powerful SoC. Starting at Rs. 13,999, the Lenovo K6 Note will be competing against the similarly priced Moto G4 Plus (Review) and will also have to fend off the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 (Review) which is priced lower and offers good overall performance."
1876,21,lenovo-phab-2-plus-review-1626707,7,10,2016-11-23,1626707,Roydon Cerejo,Lenovo Phab 2 Plus Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/lenovo-phab-2-plus-review-1626707," Lenovo is steadily expanding its Phab series of smartphones. Rather than spamming the market with a hundred variants, the company has only just launched the successor to last year's Phab Plus (Review). We felt that phone had great potential as a media consumption device but its size made it incredibly awkward to carry, even if you have abnormally large hands.This year, we have the Phab 2 Plus, which was announced as part of a trio including the Phab 2 and Phab 2 Pro. The Plus variant is the only one to make it to India so far, and it serves as a successor to the existing Phab Plus. With more manageable dimensions this time around, the highlight feature here appears to be a dual-camera setup. At Rs. 14,999, the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus locks horns with Xiaomi’s Mi Max (Review), which is pretty much the only other model in this price segment with similar features.With the Mi Max being perpetually out of stock everywhere, is Lenovo’s offering a viable alternative? Let’s find out. Lenovo Phab 2 Plus design and buildThe phone gets a metal unibody and curved Gorilla Glass on the front. It feels tough enough to withstand a drop or two. The Phab 2 Plus is a massive phone and despite Lenovo trying its best to minimise the footprint with thin bezels and no excess space above and below the display, it still requires two hands to operate. There is a one-handed mode but that only lets you shift the lockscreen's numeric PIN keypad and the dial pad to one corner for better reach, rather than shrinking the entire screen.   The display measures 6.4 inches diagonally and is an IPS panel with a full-HD resolution, which results in a crisp 344ppi pixel count. Text is sharp and icons lack jaggedness around the edges. Colour reproduction is pretty good too and the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus fares well under direct sunlight. However, the ambient light sensor can be a little slow to react at times. Touch response is also spot-on.The Phab 2 Plus gets backlit capacitive navigation keys at the bottom and a notification LED on the top. There’s a SIM tray on the left that can house either two SIM cards or one SIM and a microSD card (up to 128GB). The volume and power buttons have good tactile feedback and are placed fairly ergonomically on the right. There’s a mono speaker at the bottom along with a Micro-USB port, and a headphones socket up on the top.The back is slightly curved so the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus  sits comfortably in your palm. You’ll find the dual cameras and the fingerprint sensor on the back. The latter works well and authentication is fast and painless. We rarely had any misreads. However, you can only use it to unlock the phone, not secure apps or folders. The Phab 2 Plus ships with a 10W charger, data cable, SIM ejector, instructions, and JBL earphones. The quality of the accessories is good although we didn’t like how short the supplied cable is. The Lenovo Phab 2 Plus scores well in terms of build quality. The design feels a bit generic but the most annoying thing here has got to be its size and weight. 218 grams is a lot for something you’ll be carrying around in your pocket every single day, and it's very noticeable when you’re holding the phone up to talk or do anything for an extended period. The sheer size of the phone makes it cumbersome to carry around. It sticks out everywhere, which might not be an issue if you carry your phone in a handbag or backpack, but it's almost impossible to sit comfortably with the Phab 2 Plus in a trouser pocket. Lenovo Phab 2 Plus specifications and featuresOn paper, the Phab 2 Plus meets the core specifications we’ve come to expect from smartphones in this segment. You get an octa-core MediaTek SoC (MT8783), 3GB of RAM, and 32GB of storage. It’s interesting to note that this SoC isn't a very popular one. It consists of eight ARM Cortex-A53 cores and is built on a 28nm fabrication process, so it isn't too different from other MediaTek chips. The rest of the specifications include Bluetooth 4.0, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n/ac, FM radio, GPS, and USB OTG. The phone also supports 4G on all Indian bands and also VoLTE. This recipe works very well with the near-stock implementation of Android Marshmallow, which is a refreshing change from the custom interfaces we've seen in the past. Apart from a custom icon set, it’s pretty much untouched. The Settings app has a Smart Assist feature that lets you control things like one-handed mode and auto-answering a call when you bring it to your ear. Smart Shortcut gives you a floating menu to which you can add app shortcuts. Lenovo pre-installs apps including McAfee Security, Netflix, and Swiftkey. There’s also SHAREit, SYNCit, which unites multiple cloud services in one place, much like the equivalent programs on Lenovo's laptops. Lenovo Phab 2 Plus performanceGeneral performance is relatively smooth thanks to the near-stock Android, but performance begins to throttle once you try juggling between apps, using the AR features of the camera, or basically anything CPU intensive. We noticed intermittent stutter when multitasking and when using the camera. We also noticed that the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus heats up quickly if you’re watching a video, using the camera or even having a long call. Heat can be felt along the edges where the buttons and the headphones socket are placed, and the back. Benchmarks tell the story better. AnTuTu returned 36,629 points; GFXbench gave us just 12fps; and the Jetstrem browser benchmark retuned 17.2 points. Gaming performance seems to be limited as the Mali-T720 GPU appears to be a bit too weak for full-HD gaming. As a whole, this SoC is definitely weaker than the Snapdragon 6xx series chips which we see in many other phones in this price range. The Lenovo Phab 2 Plus deserved better.  One big feature that Lenovo is promoting with this phone is Dolby Atmos audio. An app lets you customise sound profiles based on the type of media you’re listening too. Atmos is all about 360-degree sound, which is obviously not possible with one single speaker. However, it does get fairly loud compared to most other phones with a single speaker, and audio quality is decent for games and other media. The bundled JBL earphones aren’t very good at isolating ambient noise or at audio playback. Videos encoded with Dolby Atmos support have good aural separation. Videos look great on the Phab 2 Plus, which can handle up to 1080p files. The Lenovo Phab 2 Plus  features two 13-megapixel camera sensors, laser auto-focus (AF), and phase-detection auto-focus (PDAF). The secondary camera sensor is used for measuring depth but it didn't seem to do anything to improve the quality of pictures. We tried taking photos with that lens both blocked and clear, and didn’t really see any significant difference. We recommend that you use HDR for landscapes in daylight, as without it, pictures look pretty dull. The Phab 2 Plus struggles to capture good details in distant objects, but macro shots fare much better, with good levels of detail, background blur, and colour saturation.    Tap to see full-sized Lenovo Phab 2 Plus camera samples Focusing is quick, and continuous autofocus works well even with video, although we would have liked a tap-to-focus feature too. Once the phone starts to heat up though, focusing speeds dip, and the app begins to lag. Dual-camera mode offers the ability to manipulate focus after a shot has been taken, and even swap and merge objects from one image into another. Focus manipulation doesn’t work nearly as well as it does on competing phones, or even the Refocus app on old Lumia phones. There’s also an AR mode, which you can use to add cats, dogs, and other virtual elements into a scene. It’s not new as Sony has been doing this on its Xperia phones for years now. Plus, Lenovo’s implementation is a bit clunky - switching to this mode opens another app. Again, the phone heats up while doing this.Video recording maxes out at 1080p, but the Phab 2 Plus also has the option to record in HDR. We tested this out on an HDR TV and the differences, though slight, were noticeable. Video is recorded with Dolby 5.1 audio by default. Thanks to the three microphones, the captured sound is crisp and even small nuances are amplified and can heard clearly. The front 8-megapixel camera manages decent pictures in day/ under natural light, but doesn’t do so well under artificial lighting, though the front flash helps to an extent. The first run of our HD video loop battery test lasted just 6 hours, 19 minutes. Even with regular usage, our review unit refused to run beyond 13 hours. However, we reset the device and ran the tests again, and managed to get better results of 8 hours of video playback and roughly 16-18 hours with actual usage. The 4050mAh battery thus delivered average performance. We observed that the battery holds its capacity very well at night when the phone is not in use, but begins to deplete quickly if we played a game or used the camera. There’s no official fast charging here, but the 10W charger manages to top up the phone within a couple of hours. VerdictThe Phab 2 Plus should have had all the makings of a good, large-screened phone for media consumption, but in our opinion, a couple of poor choices stop it from being a viable alternative to Xiaomi’s Mi Max.It does well enough in terms of build, display, software, and audio quality. The dual-camera setup is a bit unnecessary and the supplementary features feels a bit gimmicky, but image quality isn't too bad, especially for macro shots. We also like the fact that manufactures are incorporating HDR video recording. But a phone like this should have had a better SoC, and the one Lenovo has gone with simply lacks the power needed to handle things like augmented reality apps, heavy games, and even multitasking. The Phab 2 Plus heats up too quickly, which is quite annoying. We also expected great battery life but it turned out to be pretty average in our tests. In our opinion, the only reason one would put up with the bulk and heft of a phone like this would be to consume a lot of content, and as such, the Xiaomi Mi Max would make a better choice thanks to its slimmer profile and much better battery life. If you don't need a huge screen and are just looking for a good all-rounder, you have plenty of options such as the Moto G4 Plus (Reivew) and Lenovo Zuk Z1 (Review), to name a few in this price segment .

2308,21,lg-g7-thinq-review-1902096,9,10,2018-08-20,1902096,Roydon Cerejo,LG G7+ ThinQ Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/lg-g7-thinq-review-1902096," LG’s smartphone endeavours haven’t quite hit the same stride as its Korean rival Samsung in recent times. Globally, LG still has a big portfolio of smartphones, but of late, India seems to be getting fewer launches. Take for instance its flagship for 2018, the G7 ThinkQ. LG launched this model just before Google I/O this year, where it partnered with the search giant to launch the first Android phone with a dedicated hardware button for Google Assistant. Three months in, and LG has quietly snuck the G7+ ThinQ into India without any fanfare, which is really odd considering its aggressive price of Rs. 39,990. This puts it smack against the 8GB version of the OnePlus 6 (Review), and on paper, it appears to offers even better specifications. The OnePlus 6 has been our solid recommendation so far at around this price, although we’ve always felt that features like wireless charging and proper waterproofing would have complemented the package nicely. The LG G7+ ThinQ addresses these shortcomings, and now it’s time to see if it truly is what the OnePlus 6 should have been all along.    The ‘ThinQ’ suffix signifies the use of artificial intelligence (AI), which was introduced by LG at this year’s CES. The G7+ ThinQ is the successor to last year’s flagship LG G6 (Review) smartphone. It features an aluminium frame that’s wide enough on the sides to be easy to grip, and you get Corning Gorilla Glass 5 for the front and back. The glass blends quite seamlessly with the metal so you barely feel the edges. The side effect of this is fingerprints and smudges, which we know are hard to avoid, but the G7+ ThinQ attracts far more than usual. The buttons are easy to reach and have good feedback. The dedicated Google Assistant button can be disabled through the Settings app if you don’t want to use it, but LG doesn’t let you re-map it. When your phone is unlocked, a single press opens Google Assistant, while a double press opens Google Lens. In order to avoid accidental activation when your phone is locked, you need to either press it twice or hold it for a few seconds to summon Assistant.    The 6.1-inch IPS screen boasts of an impressive 1000nits of brightness, which translates to excellent legibility under direct sunlight. You also get a QHD+ resolution of 1440x3120 so images and text look sharp. The G7+ ThinQ has a notch, or as LG calls it, a ‘New Second Screen’. You have the option to mask it and use different background images, but we found that the default black looks best. You can enable the always-on-display feature too, which gives you interactive toggles for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc. and playback buttons for the music player. Unfortunately, since this isn’t an OLED panel, the backlight for the entire display needs to stay on instead of just the required pixels. In a pitch dark room, you can faintly see the backlighting. The notched area has enough room for the earpiece, notification LED, sensors, and a front camera. The borders around the display aren’t very slim and there’s a noticeable chin at the bottom too. The hybrid dual-SIM tray is placed on the top and this phone supports two 4G VoLTE connections at the same time. The second slot can be used for storage expansion at the cost of a second SIM. At the bottom, we have a 3.5mm headphone socket, a USB Type-C port, and a single speaker grille. Despite not having stereo speakers, the G7+ ThinQ uses the body as an acoustic chamber, which helps amplify the volume. During audio playback, you can feel the back of the phone vibrate. The screen space beside the notch can be customised with different backgrounds   The two vertically stacked cameras at the back sit nearly flush with the body and feature Gorilla Glass 4 protection, which is nice. Beside them, we have a single-LED flash and the laser autofocus sensors. The fingerprint sensor is centred a little below the cameras. The sensor is quick at authentication but you also have the option for face recognition. Face unlock kicks in when you raise the phone upwards towards you, but isn’t too secure at the default setting. It’s quick but we found that a simple 2D picture of the registered face is enough to fool it. You can enable ‘Advanced face recognition’ which makes things a bit more secure, but authentication takes longer and it doesn’t work well in low light. In the box, the LG G7+ ThinQ ships with a charger, data cable, headset, SIM eject tool, and microfibre cleaning cloth. In terms of usability, the G7+ ThinQ has comfortable proportions and doesn’t weigh too much. The tall display is a bit of challenge for one-handed use, but you can there’s a gesture to shrink the contents down for easier access. Other accessibility options like Floating Bar, which offers shortcuts for music player, contacts, screen capture, etc, also help in getting around quickly. Being a flagship smartphone, LG has gone with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 845 octa-core SoC. The ‘+’ model that’s been launched in India has 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. The phone is IP68 certified or dust and water resistance, and is also shock resistant to some degree, with a military standard (MLT-STD-810G) certification. LG claims to have used a heat pipe to cool the SoC, so we expect good thermals when gaming. Other connectivity options include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 5, NFC, USB-OTG, wireless charging, and a healthy suite of sensors. At the time of this review, our retail unit was running on Android 8 Oreo with the June 1 security patch. Android is heavily customised and we can’t help but draw comparisons to Samsung’s Experience skin. From the customisable folder colours to the little suggestion boxes at the end of every sub-menu in the Settings app, it all feels very familiar. There are loads of additions made to the software, letting you really fine-tune your user experience. However, gestures for navigation are noticeably missing. The LG G7+ ThinQ offers plenty of customisation and added software features   The UI layout can be changed from single-layered to the traditional app drawer layout; the positions of the navigation buttons can be swapped around and additional ones can be added for SIM switching, etc.; Smart Doctor helps clean up temporary files and free up RAM; and Game Tools lets you set the display resolution for each game and offers an in-game overlay for disabling alerts, taking a screenshot, etc. LG has a feature called AirDrive, which is supposed to let you manage the files on your phone, through your Mac or PC. You’ll need the LG Bridge app on your computer and you’ll need to be signed into the same account on your phone and the desktop app. However, unlike Apple’s AirDrop, you can’t share files like photos directly from the phone’s gallery to your PC. Instead, you have to do it through the file manager app. We were unable to view the files on our phone through the desktop app but we could see all our folders through the File Manager app. In the end, we rarely found much use for this, and it was quicker to just use a cable to transfer files. You get some pre-installed apps too. QuickMemo+ is a note-taking app that also syncs to your Google account; Mobile Switch lets you migrate data from your old phone over to the G7+ ThinQ; SmartWorld offers curated content like news, themes, wallpapers, etc; and LG Service lets you book an appointment at your nearest service centre. The heavy customisations to Android can be a bit overwhelming at first, even for experienced users, but after a while, you sort of get used to it. Overall , the LG G7+ ThinQ runs pretty much flawlessly with day-to-day usage. The interface feels snappy and doesn’t get bogged down even with a lots of apps running in the background. Call quality is good, and the phone doesn’t heat up with general usage. The Snapdragon 845 SoC is a proven performer, but most of the benchmark scores that this phone achieved were a bit lower than those of other phones based on this same SoC. Games run fine, including newer titles like PUBG and Asphalt 9: Legends. The phone does get quite warm while gaming or even with heavy camera use, but not to a point where it’s uncomfortable to hold, and this isn't consistent behaviour. With most phones, it's only a small portion of the back that heats up, but pretty much the entire back of the G7+ ThinQ gets warm, including parts of the metal frame. At times, we noticed it happen even when there was only background data activity, like while downloading an app from the Play Store.      LG’s flagship offerings have often been lauded for having good audio, and the G7+ ThinQ is no different. The Quad-DAC feature is present, along with other audio enhancements such as DTS:X 3D surround for wired headphones. The bundled headphones are not bad, offering decent ambient noise isolation and good audio quality. The default music player also has some gimmicky effects called Flash Light and Boombox Show, which use the rear LED flash for strobe-light effect, and display 3D visualisations on the screen, respectively. The mono speaker is impressively loud, which is nice. The display also supports the HDR 10 standard which adds more dynamism to colours when watching HDR videos. LG’s ThinQ AI can be seen in action in the camera app. With ‘AI Cam’ turned on, the camera app scans the frame and automatically adjusts the exposure and colour temperature, and even applies filters if necessary. LG has implemented some cool visualisations where words fade in and out, Sherlock Holmes style, in the viewfinder as the AI tries to figure out the subject in focus. We wish we had the option to disable the AI effects after shots are taken but thankfully, it’s not too intrusive like we’ve seen on other phones like the Huawei P20 Pro (Review). Due to LG’s close partnership with Google, the G7+ ThinQ also gets AR stickers from the Pixel line of smartphones. Shot using the wide-angle, 16-megapixel sensor on the LG G7+ ThinQ. Tap to see full-sized images.   The main 16-megapixel camera has a f/1.6 aperture while the second wide-angle 16-megapixel camera gets a f/1.9 aperture. The main sensor captures good detail in closeups and landscapes along with punchy colours, but the edges around subjects could be more distinct. The HDR feature kicks in automatically but we often found that portions of bright areas appeared overexposed. The wide-angle camera is useful when shooting landscapes or a group of people, and barrel distortion isn’t much of an issue here. Details are fairly good in low light too. The camera app has a mode called Super Bright Camera, which combines the data of four pixels into one, thus giving you better detail but at the cost of resolution. There’s OIS for the primary sensor, which helps keep shots steady in unfavourable light. The phone does a good job with edge detection in Portrait mode, and the amount of background blur can be adjusted before and after you take the shot. Video recording maxes out at 4K 30fps but you don’t get electronic stabilisation at this resolution. Videos shot at 4K have slightly boosted colours which is most evident when shooting with the wide-angle sensor. There have been reports of LG releasing an update enabling 4K 60fps recording on this phone, but our unit didn’t seem to have received it. Stabilisation is decent at 1080p 30fps and focusing is quick too, but there is a noticeable shimmer in the footage, which isn’t present when using the wide-angle lens. Tap to see full-sized LG G7+ ThinQ camera samples   There’s a comprehensive manual mode that lets you tweak audio parameters such as gain, and filter out wind noise. You also get slow-motion video mode, which lets you shoot at 240fps, but the quality is quite average. The Cine Video mode gives you pretty cool filters and cinematic zoom effects. The front 8-megapixel sensor captures good selfies, and the AI features work here too. There’s no Auto HDR though and it doesn’t work well all the time. Stabilisation works decently, which is good if you’re into vlogging. In low light, you have the option to use the screen flash to improve image quality. The 3000mAh battery easily lasts an entire workday, but getting a full 24 hours’ worth of use is a bit challenging, especially if you game a lot. With a bit of Bluetooth audio streaming, a few calls, use of Chrome and messaging apps, and few rounds of Asphalt 9: Legends, we typically clocked about 17 hours of runtime on average before we had to plug in the charger. This isn’t bad but certainly could have been better. Our internal battery loop test ran for 11 hours and 48 minutes, which is slightly above average. There’s Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 support, which got us a 42 percent charge in roughly 30 minutes. Charging the phone completely takes a little under two hours. VerdictThe G7+ ThinQ is a solid offering from LG, and more importantly, it’s available at a very aggressive price. For all those who were on the fence about the OnePlus 6 due to its lack of some features such as weather resistance and wireless charging, the G7+ ThinQ is a very good alternative. LG’s offering also features a more useful secondary rear camera, expandable storage, an excellent mono speaker, and a vivid and crisp display. There are some aspects of the phone that might not be to everyone’s liking. For instance, the custom interface has an overwhelming number of features which might be intimidating, Face recognition is a bit slow, and the cameras, while good, have some missing features such as stabilisation at 4K resolution and super-slow-motion shooting modes. Barring these little niggles, LG seems to have thrown everything but the kitchen sink into the G7+ ThinQ, and from a pure value point of view, it’s really hard to beat.   "
2132,21,lg-q6-review-1740132,7,10,2017-08-25,1740132,Roydon Cerejo,LG Q6 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/lg-q6-review-1740132," LG’s smartphone arm is having a tough year so far, as its G6 (Review) flagship smartphone has't been a runaway success. Despite it being a very good smartphone, the company has failed to translate that into good sales. In addition to the premium tier, LG hasn’t had any breakout hits with its budget or mainstream offerings either. Now, with its new Q series, LG is hoping to attack the mainstream market with features trickled down from the G6. The big highlight of its first offering is the taller FullVision display. LG launched three variants of the Q6 with different amounts of RAM in early July, and India has received the Q6 with 3GB of RAM. The smartphone is priced very attractively under Rs. 15,000, which LG hopes will attract value-conscious buyers who want to stand out. However, can the display alone be enough to make the Q6 a hit? Let’s find out.    The LG Q6 is definitely one of the most comfortable 5.5-inch smartphones we’ve used recently, thanks to its extremely slim screen borders. The display has rounded corners just like the G6, but the Gorilla Glass lacks a 2.5D curve and sits flat. Its resolution is 2160x1080 thanks to the taller aspect ratio. Unfortunately, there’s no notification LED or always-on display feature to show you missed notifications, so you’ll have to turn the display on constantly just to check. There’s just enough space above the screen for a front camera and sensors, while below it, there’s only an LG logo. The phone uses a 7000-series aluminium frame, which is impressive considering we’ve usually seen this grade of metal reserved for more expensive phones. The corners are rounded too, matching the shape of the display. The back is plastic and attracts smudges very easily, which makes the phone look a little unattractive during everyday use. It also easily picks up scratches easily, so that’s something to keep in mind.  The power and volume buttons feel good, and on the left, there are slots for two Nano-SIM cards and a microSD card. The first slot accommodates a Nano-SIM and a microSD card while the second one is for a second SIM. There’s a headphone socket and a Micro-USB port on the bottom, and a mono speaker at the back. It’s a bit disappointing to not have a USB Type-C port here, even if it only works at USB 2.0 speed. Thankfully, the camera module sits flush with the back and we didn’t see any chipping or scuffing during our review period. If you haven’t noticed it yet, the Q6 has one glaring omission and that’s a fingerprint sensor. For some reason, LG has ditched this security feature. There's face recognition instead, which works well but there are some glaring flaws which you need to be aware of. By default, face recognition works very fast - all you need to do is lift the phone to your face and it will automatically unlock itself. However, it can easily be fooled by holding a simple photo of the user in front of the camera. Secondly, even though you are allowed to register just one face, you can technically add someone else's face by using the ‘Improve face recognition’ option which has no problem adding someone else's facial structure to your own. However, to gain access to this feature, you will need a pattern or a pin, so there's some level of security put in place.  There is a way make recognition more secure, called ‘Advanced face recognition’. With this enabled, a 2D picture doesn't pass off for your face, but it also takes a lot longer to unlock the phone. Also, the whole process doesn’t work well in low light. Overall, the Q6 is a good-looking device, mostly thanks to its display. It’s built well, feels sturdy, and has an ergonomic design. We’re not happy with omissions like the fingerprint sensor, USB Type-C port and notification light on the phone. The Q6 isn’t a particularly powerful smartphone, rocking the modest Snapdragon 435 platform from Qualcomm that also powers the sub-Rs. 10,000 Xiaomi Redmi 4 (Review). This is a 64-bit octa-core SoC with eight ARM Cortex-A53 cores reaching a maximum clock speed of 1.4GHz. It’s still based on the old 28nm fabrication process. In terms of graphics, we have an integrated Adreno 505 GPU. Benchmark numbers are pretty average, with scores like 42,392 points in AnTuTu and just 12fps in GFXbench. Other specifications include 3GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi b/g/n, USB-OTG, FM radio, and 4G VoLTE. The Q6 doesn’t have a direct video call option in the dialler app, which is commonly seen on Samsung phones. We’re glad that LG has used a recent version of Android, which is 7.1.1 Nougat. Even the security patch status is fairly recent (July 1 at the time of this review).  LG’s default theme isn’t the slickest but you can dial down these customisations and bring the look closer to stock through the Settings app. The on-screen buttons on the navigation strip at the bottom of the screen can be customised and re-ordered, and you can add a fourth button for switching between SIMs or pulling down the notification shade so you don't have to stretch. The default single-layered look can be swapped for the traditional app drawer layout, and Google Assistant is present too. Stock apps includes LG Mobile Switch to help you migrate your data from an old device to the Q6; RemoteCall Service which lets an LG customer care agent control your phone remotely to fix probelms; a portal for themes and general news about LG products called LG Smart World; and Smart Doctor which lets you check your battery, storage and RAM usage. The notification shade also has a toggle called Capture+, which lets you draw and add text to screenshots. The Settings app is split into tabs which makes it easy to find what you’re looking for. You can change the way downloaded apps scale to the 18:9 screen - some can fill the entire screen while others are better off at their standard size with letterboxing. This works well with games, and you can switch between aspect ratios although this will restart the app. Other settings let you change the font, text size and thickness, and settings for the blue light filter.  Despite its lacklustre benchmark scores, the Q6 handles basic tasks very well. We found the interface to be smooth without any stuttering in animations. Multitasking is handled surprisingly well and apps load fairly quickly. The phone doesn’t heat up with regular use of common apps but the metal frame does get warm when gaming. The Q6 also does a decent job of rendering most 3D games with playable framerates. Games like Xenowerk run fine but heavier ones like Asphalt 8 aren't very smooth.  LG offers a feature called ‘Game battery saver’ which when enabled, is supposed to reduce the resolution of games to save power, but can have the effect of improving framerates. There are three options: Extended, Maximum and Custom. The latter lets you drop the resolution to all the way to 'low', which causes noticeable pixellation in games. We noticed a slight improvement in framerates in Asphalt 8 but the game still didn’t run as smoothly as it should. There’s also a feature called ‘Break time’, which pauses games and reduces the screen brightness and SoC performance to save battery power when you leave the phone idle. The display on the Q6 is good for media playback, although it can't handle 4K video files. The screen is a bit reflective but brightness is good and colours are nicely saturated. The speaker gets fairly loud in games and media, but since it’s placed at the back, it doesn’t offer the best experience. The 13-megapixel rear camera captures decent levels of detail in landscapes and macros. Colours are well represented and focusing is fairly quick. The Q6 camera viewfinder has DSLR-style green squares to represent autofocus points, but this doesn't always mean that your subject is in focus. It’s best to tap the desired area on the viewfinder to ensure proper focus. Edges around objects in close-ups and in landscapes have some compression artefacting but this is only visible if you do a 100 percent crop. The Q6 does a decently good job in low light too, with very little noise and details like text in the backgrounds of images being legible.   Tap to see full-sized LG Q6 camera samples The quality of recorded video is good but the resolution is limited to 1080p. A ‘Steady recording’ toggle in the settings helps stabilise footage fairly well. The front 5-megapixel camera produces strictly average selfies but you do get a wide-angle mode which lets you cram more people into a frame. The camera app is simple and easy to navigate. All the buttons and toggles are where you’d expect them to be. There’s a Square Camera mode, similar to what we saw on the G6, which lets you use half of the screen as a viewfinder and the other half as a reference to frame your shots. LG has also included a hidden carousel for quick sharing to social media. We found that the 3000mAh battery lasted us through nearly an entire day of regular usage, but continuous video playback makes a bigger dent. In our HD video loop test, we managed just 9 hours and 32 minutes, which isn’t great. There’s no fast charging, which is disappointing. LG Q6 in pictures The 18:9 screen aspect ratio is sure to become popular in the smartphone world, and the LG Q6 looks futuristic despite its value pricing, which could be a major selling point. Even a few of years down the line, the Q6 should still look modern. It isn't the most powerful smartphone in its class so if brute force is what you’re looking for, then you’d be better served by the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Review), Honor 6X (Review) or even the Samsung Galaxy J7 Prime (Review). The Q6 stands out because of its design and display, and we also like the level of customisation offered by its custom Android UI. Apart from these things, there’s little else to get excited about. Its budget-level processor limits performance in demanding games and apps. The rear camera is decent but the front camera could have been better. Battery life isn’t too impressive either. Finally, the missing fingerprint sensor is sure to be an inconvenience.  We would say that the LG Q6 is a good buy if you prioritise looks above all else and like having something to show off."
2319,21,nokia-5-1-plus-review-1928405,8,10,2018-10-08,1928405,Roydon Cerejo,Nokia 5.1 Plus Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/nokia-5-1-plus-review-1928405," The best thing HMD Global did this year was signing up its entire 2018 Android fleet with Google’s Android One programme. In our books, this gives it an immediate edge over the competition, as you’re guaranteed three years of security updates and two years of software updates. The Nokia line of phones has been pretty competitive thus far, with the likes of the Nokia 7 Plus (Review) and Nokia 6.1 Plus (Review) being some of the more notable recent launches. HMD Global recently introduced a new budget offering called the Nokia 5.1 Plus, which slots in at the Rs. 10,999 mark. Its positioning is a bit confusing, as one would assume it would succeed the existing Nokia 5.1, but the older model is still priced higher. While the new Nokia 5.1 Plus does have somewhat better specifications than the 5.1, has HMD Global cut some corners in in order to bring the price down? It’s time to found out.    The first thing that grabs your attention as soon as you take the Nokia 5.1 Plus out of its box is how premium it looks. A high-gloss treatment for the entire body makes it look stunning, and easily feels as though this is a phone that would typically cost upwards of Rs. 15,000. There’s 2.5D curved glass for the back too, which is a rare find in this segment. The glossy finish does introduce an ergonomic issue, as the Nokia 5.1 Plus is quite slippery. We had a couple of instances when the phone slid off a couch and onto the floor, but thankfully it didn’t pick up any dings or scuffs. It seems quite durable that way, even though HMD Global has confirmed to us that the 5.1 Plus does not use reinforced glass. We used this phone for a short time and the display didn’t pick up any scratches, but in the long run, it would be better to have a screen guard installed. The Nokia 5.1 Plus sports a 2.5D glass back which gives it a premium look   On the front, we have a 5.86-inch display with a 19:9 aspect ratio but the resolution is only HD+ (720x1520). This is one area in which HMD Global has had to cut corners in order to bring you this low price. The display is not bad by any means. Colours are vivid and punchy, black levels are good, and the brightness is more than adequate for good legibility in sunlight. All the buttons are placed on the right, and they have a good clicky feel. This phone also has a USB Type-C port, which is a rare sight in the budget segment. The dual-SIM tray is on the left, and houses two Nano SIMs. Dual 4G VoLTE is supported. The internal storage is expandable too, but you’ll have to sacrifice the second SIM slot for this. We’re not big fans of the design of the screen notch. It’s a little too wide and the space created doesn’t seem to have been utilised optimally as there’s no notification LED here. The borders are quite thick too which includes a sizeable chin at the bottom. The camera setup on the back is nearly identical to those of other recent x.1 phones from HMD Global. There is a noticeable camera bump but we didn’t see any paint scuffing during our review period. The fingerprint sensor is placed just below it, and it works well, but we wish it was slightly larger and more prominent, as it can be hard to find at times. The phone has a USB Type-C port (above) and 3.5mm headphone socket (below)   The Nokia 5.1 Plus ships with the usual accessories, including a headset. There’s no silicone case, unfortunately, which would have been useful given the phone’s slippery body. Overall, HMD Global has done a very good job with the 5.1 Plus. It looks far more premium than it costs and is light and easy to handle. The Nokia 5.1 Plus features good internals. There’s a capable MediaTek Helio P60 octa-core SoC, which is a step up from the Helio P18 in the Nokia 5.1, and posts better benchmark numbers compared to most Snapdragon 636-based phones at around this price point. At the time of this review, there is only one variant with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. This phone also supports Category 4 LTE, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, and a wide variety of GPS systems including Beidou and Galileo. There’s FM radio and USB-OTG too, but no NFC. You get stock Android 8.1 Oreo without any bloatware whatsoever. There’s Google’s suite of apps and a Support app from HMD Global for getting help with any of the phone’s features or booking an appointment with a service centre. There are some gestures, such as the ability to use the fingerprint sensor to pull down the notifications shade, and double-press the power button to launch the camera app. The phone doesn't have any bloatware, apart from a few gestures and a Support app   There’s no option to hide the notch, but this isn’t a major issue since apps that aren’t designed to fill the screen, for example games and most video players, simply don’t stretch beyond the notch. This way, content is rarely obscured. The OS is up to date too, with the September 2018 security patch, which is good. You get Android’s default face unlock feature, which is a bit of a hit or miss depending on the ambient light. We really enjoyed using the Nokia 5.1 Plus as our primary device during the review period. It’s compact enough to fit snugly in most pant pockets and it just looks really good. The glossy finish does attract fingerprints very easily, but thankfully, they come off quickly with just a single wipe of a shirtsleeve. The slipperiness unfortunately can’t be fixed, unless you put a skin or a case on this phone. The Nokia 5.1 runs cool with general tasks such as navigation, chatting, or using the GPS in apps like Uber. The area around the LED flash does begin to heat up quickly, however, when you fire up a game. Even simple ones such as Alto’s Odyssey got the temperature rising. However, the heat doesn’t spread beyond that area too much, so while the entire body does get warm after say, 30 minutes of PUBG, it’s still manageable. There’s a single loudspeaker at the bottom, which gets fairly loud at full volume, but it’s positioning means it’s also easy to block with a palm when gaming or watching anything in landscape mode. The bundled headset is as basic as it gets. The ear tips didn’t stay put in our ears, and the sound was dull and hollow. There’s a microphone for calls but no button to control music playback. The 13-megapixel primary sensor might be a step down in resolution compared to the Nokia 5.1’s camera, but it’s actually not a bad performer. There’s PDAF, an f/2.0 aperture lens and a second 5-megapixel depth sensor. Given enough light, the sensor captured good details in landscape shots. Unfortunately, it didn’t always get the exposure right, even with Auto HDR. With closeups, there was a bit of shutter lag when saving images, which at times, caused noticeable ghosting around the edges of objects. The secondary depth camera does an average job at edge detection in portrait mode and the blur that’s applied looks very artificial. You can re-adjust it after taking shots, but in our experience there wasn’t much that could be salvaged. In low light, focusing speeds dipped and landscapes suffered the most. Macros were still decent under artificial lighting. Tap to see full-sized Nokia 5.1 Plus camera samples   Additional camera features include masks that can be superimposed on people’s faces for fun, but there aren’t a lot to choose from. Beauty mode is adjustable, and thankfully, the beautification isn’t too jarring. There are Dual and P-I-P modes, which let you shoot with the rear and front camera simultaneously. There’s also a manual mode and a panorama mode. Video recording tops out at 1080p and there’s stabilisation by default, which can’t be switched off. Under good light, the shimmer effect due to electronic stabilisation wasn’t too visible, but at night, the quality of video was quite poor. There’s slow-motion shooting, which captures 720p footage at 120fps. The front 8-megapixel selfie camera captured decent selfies under good light, but the HDR didn’t kick in when we needed it to. At night, the screen flash isn’t too effective. Battery life is surprisingly good, considering the capacity of just 3060mAh. We easily managed to go a full day on a single charge. With more conservative use, we were able to last a bit longer. In our HD video loop test, we got a runtime of 14 hours and 36 minutes. There’s no fast charging, but the 10W adapter gave us a 56 percent charge in an hour, and took a little more than two hours to fully charge this phone. VerdictIt’s safe to say that the Nokia 5.1 Plus is a good option at Rs. 10,999. We understand that many phones in this segment now sport higher resolution displays, but honestly, we never found the HD+ display on this phone to be an issue. The hybrid dual-SIM slot might bother some, especially if you would like to use two SIMs and a microSD card. Low-light video performance was below average too, and light metering could have been better in daylight shots. However, the Nokia 5.1 Plus is one of the best looking phones in this segment, even with its thick screen borders and wide notch. Other things going for it include the Android One programme, excellent battery life, compact size, and a powerful processor. Is Nokia 5.1 Plus better than Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1, Redmi 6 Pro, and Realme 1?

2267,21,nokia-6-1-plus-review-india-price-design-performance-battery-life-1908213,8,10,2018-09-01,1908213,Shobhit Varma,Nokia 6.1 Plus Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/nokia-6-1-plus-review-india-price-design-performance-battery-life-1908213," 2018 will be remembered as the year when display notches became ubiquitous. The notch is undoubtedly a contentious issue in smartphone design, but it is a necessary evil in order to make today's narrow-bordered smartphones a reality. HMD Global, the company that brought Nokia back into the smartphone game last year, has now embraced this design trend with the Nokia 6.1 Plus and Nokia 5.1 Plus. The Nokia 6.1 Plus, which was launched in China back in May as the Nokia X6, is a part of the Android One initiative and runs a stock build of Android 8.1 Oreo. It features a 19:9 display, a dual camera setup at the rear, and a glass and metal design. Priced at Rs. 15,999, it competes head-on with the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review), Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review), and Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review). Is Nokia's latest budget smartphone worth a buy? Let's find out.    The Nokia 6.1 Plus features glass on the front and back, with an aluminium frame for rigidity. There is a notched display up front with sizeable borders, and the Nokia logo on the chin. Thanks to the tall aspect ratio and curved edges, the smartphone is compact and pocketable. However, one-handed use is quite difficult. When it goes on sale on August 30, the Nokia 6.1 Plus will be available in three colour options - Gloss White, Gloss Midnight Blue, and the one our review unit came in, Gloss Black. The smooth glass back looks attractive and classy but picks up a lot of smudges and fingerprints. It is also incredibly slippery - a case is recommended to give you a decent grip.    The accents around the rear camera module, fingerprint sensor, power button, and volume buttons add some much-needed flair to what is otherwise an understated design. We had some reservations about the build quality of this phone in our first impressions, on account of its low weight. However, the Nokia 6.1 Plus has stood up to ordinary daily usage quite well over the course of our review period. The left of the Nokia 6.1 Plus is blank save for the SIM tray, which makes you choose between a second Nano-SIM and a microSD card. The right side has the volume rocker and power button which are chunky, tactile, and well within reach. The dual-camera setup is placed in a pill-shaped housing, underneath which is a circular fingerprint sensor and a vertically oriented Nokia logo. There's a single loudspeaker next to the USB Type-C port at the bottom, which delivers loud and clear audio, but is a step down from the stereo speakers of the original Nokia 6 (Review). HMD Global has equipped the Nokia 6.1 Plus with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor, which is also found in the similarly priced Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro, as well as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1, which is priced starting at Rs. 10,999. Additional specifications include a 3,060mAh battery, 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage that can be expanded using a microSD card (up to 400 GB).    The Nokia 6.1 Plus is a part of the Android One initiative and runs a stock build of Android 8.1 Oreo with a guarantee of regular updates. Connectivity options include dual 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth 5, FM radio, GPS/ A-GPS, GLONASS, USB Type-C (USB 2.0), and a 3.5mm headphone jack. This phone supports dual SIMs (Nano) and both can simultaneously latch onto 4G networks. The Nokia 6.1 Plus has a 5.8-inch full-HD+ display with an aspect ratio of 19:9 and Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for protection against scratches. There is a notch up front which is thankfully quite small and does not get in the way of games and videos. Despite the notch, the screen is not borderless, and the chin in particular is pretty thick. The display is bright and punchy, and has good viewing angles. Colours are vivid and outdoor legibility is decent. The Nokia 6.1 Plus delivered a smooth and consistent user experience, tackling everything we threw at it — from basic day-to-day tasks such as browsing the Web and using social media applications, to intensive workloads — without any issues. App load times were quick and UI animations were butter smooth. Games like Asphalt 9 also ran quite smoothly, with no stutters or dropped frames. Benchmark scores were in line with those of other Snapdragon 636-powered smartphones. The Nokia 6.1 Plus managed scores of 116,134 in AnTuTu, 34fps in GFXBench T-Rex, 10fps in GFXBench Manhattan 3.1, and 1328 and 4,936 respectively in Geekbench's single- and multi-core tests. In our experience, calls were clear and 4G connectivity was consistently solid. HMD Global has so far focused on clean, fluid software, and timely updates. The Finnish company embraced Android One at the beginning of this year, which means an optimised software experience with stock Android 8.1, two years of Android version updates, and three years of monthly security updates, all guaranteed. HMD Global has promised updates to Android Pie as well as Android Q, as and when they are released.  System update screen, app drawer, and gestures   The software is fluid and very responsive. While there is no third-party bloat, there are a few nifty value additions such as the 'Ambient Display' feature that shows notifications for missed calls, alarms, and notifications without waking the phone from sleep. You can also perform a few gestures such as turning the phone over to reject a call, or picking it up to mute the ringtone. The Nokia 6.1 Plus supports face recognition, using its 16-megapixel front camera. The process is quite slow, even when lighting is favourable. Recognition is quite erratic in low light and also under very bright sunlight. Thankfully, the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor is snappy. It can also be used to show the notification shade with a downward swipe. In our HD video loop battery test, the Nokia 6.1 Plus lasted 12 hours and 10 minutes. Real-world performance was quite solid, but not spectacular. The smartphone easily got through a 12-hour day with medium to heavy use, with around 20 percent left in the tank. Our usage involved around an hour or two of navigation using Google Maps, frequent use of social media applications, games such as the recently launched Asphalt 9, and taking a couple of photos and selfies. The phone supports Quick Charge 4.0, but only a standard 10W charger is included in the box, which means that you'll need more than two and a half hours for a full recharge. On the imaging front, the Nokia 6.1 Plus has a 16-megapixel primary camera with an aperture of f/2.0, alongside a 5-megapixel monochrome secondary camera with an aperture of f/2.4. On the front, the Nokia 6.1 Plus has a 16-megapixel fixed-focus camera with an aperture of f/2.0. There is a dual-LED flash at the back. There are a number of features in the camera app, such as as a live bokeh mode, AR stickers, dual-sight mode to superimpose shots taken with the front and rear cameras simultaneously, and AI-assisted portrait lighting. Portrait shots were quite impressive with good edge detection and smooth gradients between the subject and the background. AR stickers are implemented well and can be used with both the front and the rear camera. The AI-assisted portrait lighting feature needs a lot of work at the moment. Edge detection was poor, and most of the options just overexposed the background. Tap to see full-sized Nokia 6.1 Plus camera samples   During the day, the rear camera performed quite well. Images had a good amount of detail and the the sensor's dynamic range was above average. Even shots taken in favourable lighting indoors were crisp and detailed. Colours however appeared slightly washed out regardless of lighting conditions. Low-light performance was a bit of a mixed bag. The level of detail was adequate and is a step up from the Nokia 6.1, but the camera struggled with autofocus at times. The front camera produces decent shots in favourable lighting but has trouble with exposure metering. In low light, it struggles to pull in enough light. The front camera can also shoot bokeh shots via software algorithms, which came out looking decent. There's no proper front LED flash, but just a screen flash that lights up the entire display. Dual-sight, a feature first seen in the Nokia 8 (Review), is present in the Nokia 6.1 Plus as well. You can take photos/ videos with the front and rear cameras at the same time. While this feature is pretty nifty, the quality of both the front and rear cameras takes a dive in this mode. Video recording maxes out at 1080p for the front camera, while the rear module is capable of 4K video recording. You can livestream video to YouTube and Facebook directly from the camera app, and this feature also works in dual-sight mode. The quality of videos is decent at best. Nokia 6.1 Plus in pictures   VerdictThe Nokia 6.1 Plus offers great performance, clean and fluid software, a punchy and vibrant display, and the promise of timely updates. With a sleek glass-backed design, compact dimensions, and a 19:9 display, the Nokia 6.1 Plus addresses most of the shortcomings of the Nokia 6.1, which was launched earlier on in the year. It is also priced much more aggressively. All is not smooth sailing though. The rear camera setup, while much improved from the Nokia 6.1, still cannot match up to the competition. It performs admirably in favourable light but struggles in low light. The front camera is also underwhelming. That said, the Nokia 6.1 Plus is a capable, well-rounded smartphone that will appeal to fans of stock Android. Potential buyers should also take a look at the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review) and Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review), which cost less and offer better cameras, but miss out on the benefits offered by Android One. The Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review) does have a better rear camera as compared to the Nokia 6.1 Plus but has average battery life and lacks a headphone jack and a microSD card slot.

Our usage involved around an hour or two of navigation using Google Maps, frequent use of social media applications, games such as the recently launched Asphalt 9, and taking a couple of photos and selfies. The phone supports Quick Charge 4.0, but only a standard 10W charger is included in the box, which means that you'll need more than two and a half hours for a full recharge. On the imaging front, the Nokia 6.1 Plus has a 16-megapixel primary camera with an aperture of f/2.0, alongside a 5-megapixel monochrome secondary camera with an aperture of f/2.4. On the front, the Nokia 6.1 Plus has a 16-megapixel fixed-focus camera with an aperture of f/2.0. There is a dual-LED flash at the back. There are a number of features in the camera app, such as as a live bokeh mode, AR stickers, dual-sight mode to superimpose shots taken with the front and rear cameras simultaneously, and AI-assisted portrait lighting. Portrait shots were quite impressive with good edge detection and smooth gradients between the subject and the background. AR stickers are implemented well and can be used with both the front and the rear camera. The AI-assisted portrait lighting feature needs a lot of work at the moment. Edge detection was poor, and most of the options just overexposed the background. Tap to see full-sized Nokia 6.1 Plus camera samples   During the day, the rear camera performed quite well. Images had a good amount of detail and the the sensor's dynamic range was above average. Even shots taken in favourable lighting indoors were crisp and detailed. Colours however appeared slightly washed out regardless of lighting conditions. Low-light performance was a bit of a mixed bag. The level of detail was adequate and is a step up from the Nokia 6.1, but the camera struggled with autofocus at times. The front camera produces decent shots in favourable lighting but has trouble with exposure metering. In low light, it struggles to pull in enough light. The front camera can also shoot bokeh shots via software algorithms, which came out looking decent. There's no proper front LED flash, but just a screen flash that lights up the entire display. Dual-sight, a feature first seen in the Nokia 8 (Review), is present in the Nokia 6.1 Plus as well. You can take photos/ videos with the front and rear cameras at the same time. While this feature is pretty nifty, the quality of both the front and rear cameras takes a dive in this mode. Video recording maxes out at 1080p for the front camera, while the rear module is capable of 4K video recording. You can livestream video to YouTube and Facebook directly from the camera app, and this feature also works in dual-sight mode. The quality of videos is decent at best. Nokia 6.1 Plus in pictures   VerdictThe Nokia 6.1 Plus offers great performance, clean and fluid software, a punchy and vibrant display, and the promise of timely updates. With a sleek glass-backed design, compact dimensions, and a 19:9 display, the Nokia 6.1 Plus addresses most of the shortcomings of the Nokia 6.1, which was launched earlier on in the year. It is also priced much more aggressively. All is not smooth sailing though. The rear camera setup, while much improved from the Nokia 6.1, still cannot match up to the competition. It performs admirably in favourable light but struggles in low light. The front camera is also underwhelming. That said, the Nokia 6.1 Plus is a capable, well-rounded smartphone that will appeal to fans of stock Android. Potential buyers should also take a look at the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review) and Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review), which cost less and offer better cameras, but miss out on the benefits offered by Android One. The Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review) does have a better rear camera as compared to the Nokia 6.1 Plus but has average battery life and lacks a headphone jack and a microSD card slot. Are Nokia 6.1 Plus and Nokia 5.1 Plus the best Android phones from HMD Global?

2421,21,nokia-7-1-review-nokia-7-2018-price-in-india-1959111,8,10,2018-12-07,1959111,Shobhit Varma,Nokia 7.1 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/nokia-7-1-review-nokia-7-2018-price-in-india-1959111," Ever since it revived Nokia's smartphone business, HMD Global has been launching new models at a rapid pace. The Nokia 7.1 is the latest mid-range offering from the company, slotting in between the Nokia 6.1 Plus and the Nokia 8.1. In India, the Nokia 7.1 is offered in a single configuration with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, priced at Rs. 19,999. The biggest USP of this phone is its HDR-enabled 5.84-inch notched display, which is housed in a glass-and-metal chassis. The new Nokia 7.1 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor and features a dual camera setup at the back with Zeiss optics, a stock build of Android, 4GB of RAM, and a 3,060mAh battery. With the Nokia 7.1 now on sale, let's see if the latest Nokia budget smartphone can justify its price tag.    With a machined Series 6000 aluminium frame and a die-cast metal centre, the Nokia 7.1 feels extremely solid and substantial in the hand. It also looks gorgeous and is undoubtedly one of the more attractive phones in this price range. The glass back looks sleek, and the diamond-cut chamfers and accents around the rear camera module and power/ volume buttons add a touch of class. However, the glossy finish does attract a lot of fingerprints and makes the phone quite slippery. The Nokia 7.1 sits well in the palm of the hand thanks to its relatively compact chassis and rounded corners. As with all smartphones these days, it is a bit too tall though, which makes one-handed use difficult.  The face of the Nokia 7.1 is devoid of any physical buttons — HMD Global has opted for on-screen keys instead — but the right side does house physical power and volume keys, which are tactile and solidly built. The left of the Nokia 7.1 is blank save for the SIM tray, which makes you choose between a second Nano-SIM and a microSD card. There is a notch up front, which is thankfully quite small and does not get in the way of games and videos. Android Pie does not offer an obvious way to mask the notch, but keen users can find this option in the Developer section of the Settings app. Despite the notch, the screen is not borderless, and the chin in particular is pretty thick. The dual-camera setup on the back is placed in a pill-shaped housing, with a Zeiss logo emblazoned below the primary sensor. The back panel also houses a circular fingerprint sensor, a vertical Nokia logo, and the Android One branding. There's a single loudspeaker next to the USB Type-C port at the bottom, which lacks warmth but delivers loud and clear audio. HMD Global has a penchant for keeping things simple when it comes to variants, and the same is true for the Nokia 7.1. At the moment, the smartphone is only offered in one configuration, with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. That can be expanded via a microSD card (up to 400GB). The hybrid dual-SIM tray forces you to choose between a secondary SIM and storage expansion.    The Nokia 7.1 has a 3,060mAh battery and supports fast charging. While this smartphone will be running Android 8.1 Oreo out of the box, our review unit received a stable Android 9.0 Pie update just two days after we unboxed it. Connectivity options on the smartphone include 4G LTE, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 5, GPS/ A-GPS, GLONASS, NFC, USB Type-C, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Up front, the smartphone has a 5.84-inch full-HD+ (1080x2280 pixels) IPS panel with a 19:9 aspect ratio and HDR10 support. The bright and punchy display is one of the highlights of this smartphone. Colours are vivid, viewing angles are excellent, and brightness is more than adequate. HDR content looks sharp and vibrant, and outdoor legibility is also quite good. The Nokia 7.1 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor, paired with 4GB of RAM. While that might sound underwhelming in this price segment, real-world performance is quite smooth and consistent. The phone does struggle slightly when pushed, but day-to-day tasks are handled well, and UI animations are butter-smooth. In our experience, games like Asphalt 9 ran quite smoothly, albeit at medium graphic settings. Benchmark scores were in line with those of other Snapdragon 636-powered smartphones. The Nokia 7.1 managed scores of 116,083 in AnTuTu, 33fps in GFXBench T-Rex, 9.6fps in GFXBench Manhattan 3.1, and 1,340 and 4,926 respectively in Geekbench's single- and multi- core tests. In our experience, calls were clear and 4G connectivity was consistently solid.    Being an Android One smartphone, the Nokia 7.1 runs a stock build of Android devoid of any third-party bloat and manufacturer skins/ overlays. There is no ability to run two WhatsApp instances, for example, a feature often seen in phones from Huawei, Samsung, and Realme. The software is fluid and responsive, and features a few nifty value additions such as the 'Ambient Display' feature that shows notifications for missed calls and app notifications without waking the phone from sleep. You can perform a few gestures such as turning the phone over to reject a call, or picking it up to mute the ringtone. You can also use Android Pie's navigational gestures, which are well implemented and easy to use. The Digital Wellbeing feature is present as well, and lets you track how frequently you use different apps, how many times you unlock the phone, and how many notifications you receive on a daily basis. Android Pie also offers a dark mode which darkens the app drawer, quick toggles panel, and certain first-party applications such as Contacts. Certain elements of the UI such as the Settings app and the notification shade are untouched, and some applications like Messages have dark modes of their own, which aren't triggered by the systemwide toggle. We would have liked the dark mode to be more consistent and darken every aspect of the UI instead of just certain elements. Digital Wellbeing, Gestures, and the Adaptive Battery feature   The Nokia 7.1 supports face recognition, using its 8-megapixel fixed-focus front camera. This works well enough when there's an adequate light but is quite erratic in low light and also under very bright sunlight. The setup process is also slower than what we have experienced with phones from Huawei and Realme. Hopefully, this can be improved with future software updates. The rear-mounted fingerprint scanner is another story altogether. It is accurate, ergonomically placed, and quite snappy. It can also be used to show the notification shade with a downward swipe, which is quite useful. In our HD video loop battery test, the Nokia 7.1 lasted 9 hours and 30 minutes, which is a fairy average score. Real-world performance was quite solid however, with the phone powering through a 12-hour day with medium to heavy use, with around 15 percent left in the tank. Android Pie has a battery saver mode as well as a feature called Adaptive Battery that limits battery use for applications you don't use often. The bundled fast charger charges takes around 1.5 hours to fully charge the phone. Despite having a glass back, the phone does not support wireless charging. On the imaging front, the Nokia 7.1 features a dual-camera setup at the back with Zeiss optics and electronic image stabilisation. There's a f12-megapixel primary camera with an aperture of f/1.8 and a 5-megapixel secondary camera with an aperture of f/2.4. On the front, the smartphone has an 8-megapixel fixed-focus camera with an aperture of f/2.0 and a 84-degree field of view. The front sensor makes do with a screen flash and the rear cameras are accompanied by a dual-LED flash. Images shot in adequate light were crisp and detailed with vivid colours. In our experience, portrait shots were also quite impressive with good edge detection and smooth gradients between the subject and the background. Images shot in low light had a good amount of detail and noise was kept to a minimum. This phone does over-sharpen images at times, and colour reproduction is inconsistent. HMD Global has made big strides when it comes to low-light performance but there is still a little way to go to match the likes of the Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review), which has one of the best cameras in this segment. Tap to see full-sized Nokia 7.1 camera samples   The 8-megapixel selfie shooter did a good job in well-lit situations. Noise did creep in in low light, but the level of detail was satisfactory. There's no proper front LED flash, but the screen flash lights up the entire display. The front camera uses software algorithms to take portrait shots, and the implementation is iffy, with average edge detection. The camera app is loaded with features such as as AR stickers, dual-sight mode to superimpose shots taken with the front and rear cameras simultaneously, and AI-assisted portrait lighting. AR stickers are implemented quite well and can be used with the front and the rear cameras. The quality of the both the front and rear cameras takes a dive in dual-sight mode, which is a shame as the feature could be fun to use. The AI-assisted portrait lighting feature is pretty half-baked at the moment, and most of the options just overexpose the background. Video recording maxes out at 1080p for the front camera, while the rear module is capable of 4K video recording. The quality of videos is quite decent, with the electronic image stabilisation helping keep things relatively smooth. Nokia 7.1 in pictures   VerdictOn paper, the Nokia 7.1 seems a bit of a tough sell at Rs 19,999. Similarly priced phones such as the Poco F1 and Honor Play are powered by flagship-grade processors. The Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review) and Motorola One Power (Review) offer stock Android and a similar level of performance for Rs 10,999 and Rs 14,999 respectively. However, the Nokia 7.1 is an excellent all-rounder with a lot more going for it than just processor power. The crisp and vivid HDR display is the main selling point of the Nokia 7.1, and is arguably one of the best in this price range. The display alone is worth the price jump from the likes of the Motorola One Power. The well-optimised software package, promise of timely updates, striking looks, great build quality, and solid cameras only add to this phone's appeal. With the Nokia 7.1, HMD Global has taken big strides in terms of low-light camera performance as well, which has always been the Achilles' heel of the Finnish company's offerings. Power users might be better served by Poco F1 (Review) and Honor Play (Review), which are powered by flagship grade processors. However, the all-plastic Poco F1 does not look or feel as premium as the Nokia 7.1 and both MIUI and EMUI are cluttered and laden with third-party bloat. For the average joe, the Nokia 7.1 would make for a solid everyday smartphone."
2422,21,nokia-8-1-review-1959484,8,10,2018-12-11,1959484,Jamshed Avari,Nokia 8.1 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/nokia-8-1-review-1959484," As if HMD Global's number-and-decimal model hierarchy wasn't confusing enough, there has been a course correction with the Nokia 8.1. This phone is not in any way meant to be superior to last year's flagship Nokia 8 or the Nokia 8 Sirocco — from now on, flagship models will almost certainly make up a new 9-series tier. Instead, the new Nokia 8.1 is a premium model for those who don't want to spend flagship-level money. Sure enough, there is a fairly wide gap in the market right now because thanks to relentless price wars, we now have a lot of sub-Rs. 20,000 phones with features that were considered impossible to find at that level just about a year ago. However, the prices of premium phones have been coming down as well. We have the very strong Poco F1 (Review) and Asus ZenFone 5Z (Review), as well as Samsung's triple-camera Galaxy A7 (Review), which tempt buyers in the sub-Rs. 30,000 bracket with flagship-grade features. Has HMD Global judged the market correctly, and can the new Nokia 8.1 find its footing here? We're about to find out. The Nokia 8.1 feels big, chunky, and heavy thanks to the materials and styling that HMD Global has gone with. The body is made of solid aluminium with glass on the front and rear. You have a choice of two colours — Blue/ Silver and Iron/ Steel — both of which have contrasting metal accents. Our review unit is the Iron version, which is more of a very deep plum purple, and is quite unusual. There's a thick, flat band of highly polished steel running all around the sides. Visually, the band emphasises this phone's 7.97mm thickness by splitting the body and interrupting the smooth curve of the sides. There are similarly shiny accents around camera bump and fingerprint sensor on the back. On the positive side, the Nokia 8.1 is built like a tank. Every part of it feels completely solid, right down to the thick metal SIM tray and the power and volume buttons. The body doesn't twist or flex even slightly. The glass on the front is an unspecified version of Corning Gorilla Glass, and HMD Global hasn't confirmed whether the back is reinforced as well. Water and dust resistance would have been nice, but there doesn't seem to be any IPxx rating. The display notch is quite wide, and the earpiece, front camera, front flash, and proximity sensor are accommodated inside it. The chin isn't too thick, but a reflective Nokia logo draws the eye there. On the back, the camera module bulges outward far more than what we've become used to seeing on phones like the OnePlus 6T. When lying on its back, the Nokia 8.1 rests on the camera bump and the glass surface barely makes contact with whatever is beneath it, which actually helps prevent it from sliding around. Despite its proportions, the Nokia 8.1 is easy enough to grip. We were able to use it with one hand in some situations without worrying that it might slip and fall. Overall, while the material quality as well as the fit and finish of the Nokia 8.1 are excellent, it isn't as slick or modern as some of its competitors.  The most interesting thing about the Nokia 8.1 is that it isn't meant to succeed the Nokia 8 (Review) or Nokia 8 Sirocco (Review), both of which were flagship devices using the once-flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. Instead, what we have is our first phone running the new Snapdragon 710, which is still meant to be premium, but not quite top-of-the-line. Qualcomm introduced the new 7xx series to address the fact that Snapdragon 6xx SoCs are now common in sub-Rs. 20,000 phones, leaving a huge gap between that level and the sole Snapdragon 8xx model of each generation. The Snapdragon 710 supports high-end smartphone features with a dedicated AI subsystem, support for multiple high-resolution cameras, modern LTE modem, and of course beefy CPU and GPU cores. There are eight custom Kryo 360 CPU cores, but there's a twist that the spec sheet isn't clear about — two of these are Kryo 360 Gold cores (ARM Cortex-A75) running at up to 2.2GHz, and six are Kryo 360 Silver (ARM Cortex-A55) running at 1.7GHz. The Adreno 616 GPU is also claimed to deliver “console-like” gaming quality. Another highlight of this phone is its HDR10-capable screen. It measures 6.18 inches from corner to corner and has an unusual 18.7:9 aspect ratio, which makes the resolution 1080x2246. There's a 3500mAh battery, and “18W fast charging” is supported and you get a big 18W charger in the box, though HMD Global isn't using the Qualcomm Quick Charge name. There's only one configuration option for the Nokia 8.1, with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. That seems a little stingy, considering that 128GB is not uncommon at this price level. You can pop in a microSD card, but that means sacrificing a second SIM thanks to the hybrid dual-SIM design. Speaking of SIMs, 4G and VoLTE are supported on both. You also get Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 5, NFC, FM radio, and GPS. There's a USB Type-C port on the bottom and a 3.5mm audio jack on the top.    Our review unit was already running Android 9.0 Pie when we first took it out of its sealed box. This is an Android One phone, which means you get the stock Android UI and you're guaranteed regular and quick security updates as well as major version updates for at least two years. We did notice a few minor UI customisations including forced icon outlines on the home screens and in the app drawer — you can choose between several shapes, but you can't just let icons be. Our unit had the new Android 9.0 gestures enabled by default instead of standard navigation buttons. We find this to be a little frustrating to use, but at least it can be reverted, unlike on Google's Pixel 3 phones. To do so, you have to find the Gestures section in the Settings app and then uncheck ‘Swipe up on Home button'. Thanks to the wide notch, the only way to see your battery level percentage is to have tiny numbers within the battery icon, or pull down the notifications shade. The numbers in the icon are only visible if you squint, which means you lose this important glanceable information. If you want to mask the notch with a black band, you'll have to dig through the hidden Developer panel in the Settings app and check ‘Full Bezel'. This will apply system-wide, not per-app. There are a few display presets so you can choose standard, vivid, or muted colours. The default is Dynamic, which changes the preset depending on what you're doing. An Ambient Display feature shows the time, date, and notification icons in monochrome, and you can tap to take an action when you get an incoming message. The Ambient Display can stay on while the phone is charging, but it isn't on all the time otherwise because this isn't an AMOLED panel. Preloaded software is limited to Google's own apps including Google Pay (formerly Google Tez) and a Nokia Care support app. Once you start using Google Assistant and tying in your Google services, you'll see “At a glance” information on the home screens, including traffic alerts and upcoming calendar events. There's a lot to be said for the snappiness of the stock Android experience, but you don't get other useful features such as the ability to run multiple instances of some apps or a secure area for hidden files and apps.  We were curious to put the brand new Snapdragon 710 SoC through its paces with all our usual benchmarks. Starting with AnTuTu, we got a score of 1,71,343. Geekbench's single-core and multi-core tests gave us 1,827 and 5,867 respectively, and Basemark Web 3.0 returned 222.09 points. On the graphics front, we got 57fps in GFXBench's T-rex test and 22fps in the Manhattan 3.1 test. These scores show a reasonable bump in performance compared to, say, the Snapdragon 660 or MediaTek Helio P60, more so in graphics quality than CPU strength. We're still nowhere near what the Snapdragon 845 can pump out, though. In terms of real-world usage, the experience was predictably smooth throughout our review period. Phones with much lower-tier processors these days function without stuttering, and so we were not disappointed. We were able to switch between apps and multiple Chrome browser tabs without any stress. PUBG and Asphalt 9: Legends were perfectly smooth as well. Asphalt 9 defaulted to its medium quality preset but worked fine after we bumped that up, and PUBG ran at its high framerate and quality presets from the start. The HDR screen jumped to life when we tried some YouTube demo videos. Even if the resolution drops down to 480p or so, you can watch videos with HDR and there are no modes or settings to worry about. HDR videos look particularly good because of how close you generally hold a smartphone to your face, as long as you push the brightness up. Of course, this will stress the battery, and we noticed a drop of about 2 percent after watching five or six minutes of HDR video at 1080p. You can't override HDR on a system-wide level if you want to turn it off, though. Sound through the single mono speaker is very loud and is not too harsh or tinny. That brings us to battery life, which wasn't terribly exciting. After a full day of use including about two hours of non-HDR video streaming and a few rounds of PUBG, plus the usual messaging and Web browsing, we found that the Nokia 8.1 was down to about 10 percent by the time we went to bed at night. Our HD video loop test ran for just 9 hours, 21 minutes. The Nokia 8.1 has a 12-megapixel primary rear camera with a Zeiss-branded lens, and optical image stabilisation along with a secondary 13-megapixel fixed-focus depth sensor. Nokia hasn't published the aperture values, but touts the primary camera's “super-sensitive” 1/2.55-inch sensor with 1.4-micron pixels. There's a 20-megapixel front camera with an adaptive mode that combines four pixels to capture better detail in low light at the expense of resolution. The camera app is fairly busy, with a row of eight icons at the top to give you quick access to lots of features and the detailed Settings menu. A ribbon of modes runs across the bottom, letting you select Square, Panorama, Live Bokeh, Pro, Auto Photo, Video, Slow Motion, and Time-lapse. You can also trigger the Pro mode by dragging the shutter release button upwards. If you've used high-end Nokia phones in the past, you'll recognise the concentric rings that can be slid around to change various settings. On a phone this large, it can be difficult to reach all the settings while holding the camera up to frame a shot. Tap to see full-sized Nokia 8.1 camera samples   Photo quality was good, but not especially consistent. Many of our daytime samples had very good detail and vibrant colours. The Nokia 8.1 was quick to lock focus and was fun to use. There was a bit of overexposure in some shots, and bright parts of the sky would get blown out easily. It took a little while to make sure focus was in the right spot for Live Bokeh shots, but they came out looking great. At night however, quality took a nosedive. Shots were generally quite bright, but there was way too much noise, and details were grainy. Distant objects couldn't be made out well, and even when shots looked passable on the phone itself, we saw that the focus was sometimes completely wrong when we reviewed our photos on a big screen later. Videos taken in the daytime were crisp and sharp. Optical image stabilisation definitely made a difference at the default 1920x1080 recording resolution. Even as we walked on an uneven pavement, footage came out looking pretty smooth. At night, there was a weird throbbing effect in our sample videos, and they were far shakier and blurrier. The front camera was pretty good in most situations, including in the dark. You can choose to overlay shots taken with the front and rear cameras simultaneously, either side by side or picture-in-picture. Beautification is available and off by default. Nokia 8.1 in pictures VerdictThe Nokia 8.1 is a confusingly named phone. We aren't judging it by its predecessors, but it's hard to say exactly where this phone fits because it doesn't offer any flagship-class features, but doesn't fit into a value-conscious price bracket either. If you want to spend around Rs. 30,000, there are more powerful options such as the Asus ZenFone 5Z and Poco F1. On the other hand, there are several models that cost well under Rs. 20,000 and deliver a similar level of performance — including the new Nokia 7.1 (Review). This phone can be seen as an upgrade over the usual low-cost options in terms of its material and construction quality, style, display, and cameras – the latter in the daytime, at least. Some users might also be willing to pay a little more for the Nokia name. There is a lot to like about the Nokia 8.1, but most of the things that give it its appeal can also be found in phones that cost much less."

There are eight custom Kryo 360 CPU cores, but there's a twist that the spec sheet isn't clear about — two of these are Kryo 360 Gold cores (ARM Cortex-A75) running at up to 2.2GHz, and six are Kryo 360 Silver (ARM Cortex-A55) running at 1.7GHz. The Adreno 616 GPU is also claimed to deliver “console-like” gaming quality. Another highlight of this phone is its HDR10-capable screen. It measures 6.18 inches from corner to corner and has an unusual 18.7:9 aspect ratio, which makes the resolution 1080x2246. There's a 3500mAh battery, and “18W fast charging” is supported and you get a big 18W charger in the box, though HMD Global isn't using the Qualcomm Quick Charge name. There's only one configuration option for the Nokia 8.1, with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. That seems a little stingy, considering that 128GB is not uncommon at this price level. You can pop in a microSD card, but that means sacrificing a second SIM thanks to the hybrid dual-SIM design. Speaking of SIMs, 4G and VoLTE are supported on both. You also get Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 5, NFC, FM radio, and GPS. There's a USB Type-C port on the bottom and a 3.5mm audio jack on the top.    Our review unit was already running Android 9.0 Pie when we first took it out of its sealed box. This is an Android One phone, which means you get the stock Android UI and you're guaranteed regular and quick security updates as well as major version updates for at least two years. We did notice a few minor UI customisations including forced icon outlines on the home screens and in the app drawer — you can choose between several shapes, but you can't just let icons be. Our unit had the new Android 9.0 gestures enabled by default instead of standard navigation buttons. We find this to be a little frustrating to use, but at least it can be reverted, unlike on Google's Pixel 3 phones. To do so, you have to find the Gestures section in the Settings app and then uncheck ‘Swipe up on Home button'. Thanks to the wide notch, the only way to see your battery level percentage is to have tiny numbers within the battery icon, or pull down the notifications shade. The numbers in the icon are only visible if you squint, which means you lose this important glanceable information. If you want to mask the notch with a black band, you'll have to dig through the hidden Developer panel in the Settings app and check ‘Full Bezel'. This will apply system-wide, not per-app. There are a few display presets so you can choose standard, vivid, or muted colours. The default is Dynamic, which changes the preset depending on what you're doing. An Ambient Display feature shows the time, date, and notification icons in monochrome, and you can tap to take an action when you get an incoming message. The Ambient Display can stay on while the phone is charging, but it isn't on all the time otherwise because this isn't an AMOLED panel. Preloaded software is limited to Google's own apps including Google Pay (formerly Google Tez) and a Nokia Care support app. Once you start using Google Assistant and tying in your Google services, you'll see “At a glance” information on the home screens, including traffic alerts and upcoming calendar events. There's a lot to be said for the snappiness of the stock Android experience, but you don't get other useful features such as the ability to run multiple instances of some apps or a secure area for hidden files and apps.  We were curious to put the brand new Snapdragon 710 SoC through its paces with all our usual benchmarks. Starting with AnTuTu, we got a score of 1,71,343. Geekbench's single-core and multi-core tests gave us 1,827 and 5,867 respectively, and Basemark Web 3.0 returned 222.09 points. On the graphics front, we got 57fps in GFXBench's T-rex test and 22fps in the Manhattan 3.1 test. These scores show a reasonable bump in performance compared to, say, the Snapdragon 660 or MediaTek Helio P60, more so in graphics quality than CPU strength. We're still nowhere near what the Snapdragon 845 can pump out, though. In terms of real-world usage, the experience was predictably smooth throughout our review period. Phones with much lower-tier processors these days function without stuttering, and so we were not disappointed. We were able to switch between apps and multiple Chrome browser tabs without any stress. PUBG and Asphalt 9: Legends were perfectly smooth as well. Asphalt 9 defaulted to its medium quality preset but worked fine after we bumped that up, and PUBG ran at its high framerate and quality presets from the start. The HDR screen jumped to life when we tried some YouTube demo videos. Even if the resolution drops down to 480p or so, you can watch videos with HDR and there are no modes or settings to worry about. HDR videos look particularly good because of how close you generally hold a smartphone to your face, as long as you push the brightness up. Of course, this will stress the battery, and we noticed a drop of about 2 percent after watching five or six minutes of HDR video at 1080p. You can't override HDR on a system-wide level if you want to turn it off, though. Sound through the single mono speaker is very loud and is not too harsh or tinny. That brings us to battery life, which wasn't terribly exciting. After a full day of use including about two hours of non-HDR video streaming and a few rounds of PUBG, plus the usual messaging and Web browsing, we found that the Nokia 8.1 was down to about 10 percent by the time we went to bed at night. Our HD video loop test ran for just 9 hours, 21 minutes. The Nokia 8.1 has a 12-megapixel primary rear camera with a Zeiss-branded lens, and optical image stabilisation along with a secondary 13-megapixel fixed-focus depth sensor. Nokia hasn't published the aperture values, but touts the primary camera's “super-sensitive” 1/2.55-inch sensor with 1.4-micron pixels. There's a 20-megapixel front camera with an adaptive mode that combines four pixels to capture better detail in low light at the expense of resolution. The camera app is fairly busy, with a row of eight icons at the top to give you quick access to lots of features and the detailed Settings menu. A ribbon of modes runs across the bottom, letting you select Square, Panorama, Live Bokeh, Pro, Auto Photo, Video, Slow Motion, and Time-lapse. You can also trigger the Pro mode by dragging the shutter release button upwards. If you've used high-end Nokia phones in the past, you'll recognise the concentric rings that can be slid around to change various settings. On a phone this large, it can be difficult to reach all the settings while holding the camera up to frame a shot. Tap to see full-sized Nokia 8.1 camera samples   Photo quality was good, but not especially consistent. Many of our daytime samples had very good detail and vibrant colours. The Nokia 8.1 was quick to lock focus and was fun to use. There was a bit of overexposure in some shots, and bright parts of the sky would get blown out easily. It took a little while to make sure focus was in the right spot for Live Bokeh shots, but they came out looking great. At night however, quality took a nosedive. Shots were generally quite bright, but there was way too much noise, and details were grainy. Distant objects couldn't be made out well, and even when shots looked passable on the phone itself, we saw that the focus was sometimes completely wrong when we reviewed our photos on a big screen later. Videos taken in the daytime were crisp and sharp. Optical image stabilisation definitely made a difference at the default 1920x1080 recording resolution. Even as we walked on an uneven pavement, footage came out looking pretty smooth. At night, there was a weird throbbing effect in our sample videos, and they were far shakier and blurrier. The front camera was pretty good in most situations, including in the dark. You can choose to overlay shots taken with the front and rear cameras simultaneously, either side by side or picture-in-picture. Beautification is available and off by default. Nokia 8.1 in pictures VerdictThe Nokia 8.1 is a confusingly named phone. We aren't judging it by its predecessors, but it's hard to say exactly where this phone fits because it doesn't offer any flagship-class features, but doesn't fit into a value-conscious price bracket either. If you want to spend around Rs. 30,000, there are more powerful options such as the Asus ZenFone 5Z and Poco F1. On the other hand, there are several models that cost well under Rs. 20,000 and deliver a similar level of performance — including the new Nokia 7.1 (Review). This phone can be seen as an upgrade over the usual low-cost options in terms of its material and construction quality, style, display, and cameras – the latter in the daytime, at least. Some users might also be willing to pay a little more for the Nokia name. There is a lot to like about the Nokia 8.1, but most of the things that give it its appeal can also be found in phones that cost much less."
2422,21,nokia-8-1-review-1959484,8,10,2018-12-11,1959484,Jamshed Avari,Nokia 8.1 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/nokia-8-1-review-1959484," As if HMD Global's number-and-decimal model hierarchy wasn't confusing enough, there has been a course correction with the Nokia 8.1. This phone is not in any way meant to be superior to last year's flagship Nokia 8 or the Nokia 8 Sirocco — from now on, flagship models will almost certainly make up a new 9-series tier. Instead, the new Nokia 8.1 is a premium model for those who don't want to spend flagship-level money. Sure enough, there is a fairly wide gap in the market right now because thanks to relentless price wars, we now have a lot of sub-Rs. 20,000 phones with features that were considered impossible to find at that level just about a year ago. However, the prices of premium phones have been coming down as well. We have the very strong Poco F1 (Review) and Asus ZenFone 5Z (Review), as well as Samsung's triple-camera Galaxy A7 (Review), which tempt buyers in the sub-Rs. 30,000 bracket with flagship-grade features. Has HMD Global judged the market correctly, and can the new Nokia 8.1 find its footing here? We're about to find out. The Nokia 8.1 feels big, chunky, and heavy thanks to the materials and styling that HMD Global has gone with. The body is made of solid aluminium with glass on the front and rear. You have a choice of two colours — Blue/ Silver and Iron/ Steel — both of which have contrasting metal accents. Our review unit is the Iron version, which is more of a very deep plum purple, and is quite unusual. There's a thick, flat band of highly polished steel running all around the sides. Visually, the band emphasises this phone's 7.97mm thickness by splitting the body and interrupting the smooth curve of the sides. There are similarly shiny accents around camera bump and fingerprint sensor on the back. On the positive side, the Nokia 8.1 is built like a tank. Every part of it feels completely solid, right down to the thick metal SIM tray and the power and volume buttons. The body doesn't twist or flex even slightly. The glass on the front is an unspecified version of Corning Gorilla Glass, and HMD Global hasn't confirmed whether the back is reinforced as well. Water and dust resistance would have been nice, but there doesn't seem to be any IPxx rating. The display notch is quite wide, and the earpiece, front camera, front flash, and proximity sensor are accommodated inside it. The chin isn't too thick, but a reflective Nokia logo draws the eye there. On the back, the camera module bulges outward far more than what we've become used to seeing on phones like the OnePlus 6T. When lying on its back, the Nokia 8.1 rests on the camera bump and the glass surface barely makes contact with whatever is beneath it, which actually helps prevent it from sliding around. Despite its proportions, the Nokia 8.1 is easy enough to grip. We were able to use it with one hand in some situations without worrying that it might slip and fall. Overall, while the material quality as well as the fit and finish of the Nokia 8.1 are excellent, it isn't as slick or modern as some of its competitors.  The most interesting thing about the Nokia 8.1 is that it isn't meant to succeed the Nokia 8 (Review) or Nokia 8 Sirocco (Review), both of which were flagship devices using the once-flagship Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor. Instead, what we have is our first phone running the new Snapdragon 710, which is still meant to be premium, but not quite top-of-the-line. Qualcomm introduced the new 7xx series to address the fact that Snapdragon 6xx SoCs are now common in sub-Rs. 20,000 phones, leaving a huge gap between that level and the sole Snapdragon 8xx model of each generation.

2337,21,oppo-f3-review-1694203,7,10,2017-05-22,1694203,Roydon Cerejo,Oppo F3 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/oppo-f3-review-1694203," Oppo’s dual selfie camera feature now comes to the sub-Rs. 20,000 price segment with the Oppo F3. We reviewed the F3 Plus (Review) back in March, which apart from being a good smartphone, had a practical use case for the secondary front camera, a feature we really appreciated. The company has now brought that same camera setup to a more affordable price segment, and in essence, this model replaces the ageing Oppo F1s (Review). In order to achieve price point, Oppo has made a few compromises in the materials used for the chassis, the rear camera, and the processor under the hood. Let’s see if the new Oppo F3 can still deliver good value despite these reductions.    Oppo F3 design and build qualityIf you’ve use the Oppo F3 Plus or at least held it, then you’ll instantly appreciate the smaller size of the Oppo F3. The phone is fairly slim at 7.3mm and light at 153 grams. It's a lot more pocketable compared to its more expensive 6-inch sibling. The 5.5-inch display with slim borders on either side makes it easy to use this phone one-handed, however the notification shade is still a bit of reach even for those with large hands. The sides of the display don’t blend with the body very smoothly, and the pre-applied screen protector gets in the way every time you swipe left or right. The layout of the buttons and ports has't really changed compared to our last few experiences with Oppo smartphones. There’s a large capacitive Home button below the screen that’s flanked by two capacitive navigation keys, which are backlit. The power button is on the right, while the volume buttons are on the left. The SIM tray can accommodate two Nano SIMs and there’s a dedicated slot for a microSD card (up to 128GB). The chassis is built using plastic except for the back plate, which is metal. This surface is prone to scuffs so it’s advisable to use the bundled silicone case with the F3.  We found the brightness of the display on the Oppo F3 to be sufficient for outdoor use, and colours don’t get jarring like they did on the F3 Plus. The display is fairly sharp thanks to the full-HD resolution, and can resist damage thanks to the use of Corning Gorilla Glass 5. We didn’t have any issues with touch response either. The audio socket, Micro-USB port, and speaker grille are all on the bottom. Overall, the Oppo F3 doesn’t disappoint in terms of build quality and aesthetics. It looks and feels very much like the Oppo F1s, which can be a good thing if you liked that design. In the box, you get a 10W power adapter, a data cable, a headset, a silicone case, a SIM ejector tool, and the instruction manuals. Oppo F3 specifications and features We understand that Oppo had to cut corners in order to bring down the price of this phone, but the choice of SoC is slightly disappointing. The F3 is stuck with an octa-core MediaTek MT6750T SoC, which is a mild refresh of the MT6750 seen on the Oppo F1s. From what we can tell, it only has a higher GPU clock speed. In benchmarks, the F3 produces decent numbers. We got 53,023 points in AnTutu but GFXbench resulted in just 17fps during a run of the T-Rex test. The phone also has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, which is plenty for today's apps and games. Other specifications include Bluetooth 4.0, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n, USB-OTG, GPS, a proximity sensor, a compass, and a gyroscope.  There’s also support for 4G with VoLTE, but this phone lacks FM radio.  The Oppo F3 still uses ColorOS 3.0, based on Android 6 Marshmallow. The interface has a strong likeness to iOS, which is noticeable in some of the icons for system apps. Pulling down the notification shade only shows you quick settings toggle switches, and you have to swipe right to get to your notifications, which can be annoying. The fingerprint sensor works well and you can lock apps and files with it. Certain apps like WhatsApp can be cloned so you can have a second instance running for your second SIM card. There are some on-screen and screen-off gestures to aid in single-handed use and let you open apps when the phone is in standby. Oppo also has its lockscreen magazine, which when enabled, cycles through different wallpapers. O-Cloud is for backing up your contacts and messages, and there's a custom app store for curated apps. Other preloaded apps include Google’s suite, Facebook, Instagram, Amazon, and WPS Office.  Oppo F3 performance, camera, and battery life Despite the slightly dated SoC, there isn’t any noticeable lag in the interface. The Oppo F3 handles multitasking pretty well too. The phones gets a bit warm while gaming or watching videos for an extended period of time, but not to the extent that usage is hampered. Button feedback and placement is good and we didn’t have any issues with call quality either. There is a notification LED, placed next to the front cameras, but it’s only triggered for missed calls and messages, not WhatsApp or other apps. The volume level for alerts is good but the placement of the speaker isn’t ideal, and your palms tend to block it when gaming or watching videos in landscape mode. Full-HD videos play just fine and we didn’t have any trouble with our high-bitrate files. There is a sound enhancement feature built into the OS called Real Sound Technology, which is jointly developed by Oppo and Dirac Research. The effect isn’t very significant when using the bundled headset, but can be felt better with more capable headphones. Tap to see full sized Oppo F3 camera samples Around the back, we have a 13-megapixel sensor with Dual PDAF and an f/2.2 aperture. Focusing is quick in good lighting although we noticed that the speed dips a bit in low light. Landscapes taken in daylight have good detail although the colours could have been a little more vivid. Auto HDR mode works well too. Macros look good on the phone’s display but aren’t very sharp once you actually zoom in. Low-light shots are acceptable but details are a bit lacking in landscapes and macros. The single LED flash isn’t too powerful either.  Oppo F3 selfie camera - normal (left) vs. wide (right) However, it's the front cameras that are the main stars here, and just like on the F3 Plus, they do a good job with selfies. The primary 16-megapixel shooter captures detailed shots but doesn’t always get light metering right, especially if you’re shooting against a bright background. The secondary 8-megapixel sensor captures a wider field of view thereby allowing more people to fit in a frame, but keep in mind that this also introduces some barrel distortion. The quality of images is not as good with the secondary front camera as it is with the primary one, especially in low light, but it’s acceptable. The screen flash really helps in reducing noise from faces but there's no escaping noise in the background of a shot. There’s a blur mode which only works for the main front camera and creates a pseudo-bokeh effect. Beauty mode lets you enhance the look of your skin. They're fun features and work relatively well. You get the usual variety of shooting modes that we’ve seen before, including Expert Mode, which lets you set shutter speed and focus and also lets you save RAW files. The camera app is designed well and is easy to navigate. Video recording tops out at 1080p for the front and rear cameras, and quality is pretty good. The 3200mAh battery easily manged to power this phone through a full day’s worth of regular usage. We got about 10 hours and 33 minutes of continuous video playback, but we expected better. The 10W power adapter helps charge the phone relatively quickly, but we still wish real fast charging was supported.  Verdict The Oppo F3 is priced at Rs. 19,990, which we feel is a bit on the higher side considering the processor it's packing. However, there isn’t much competition right now as it's the only smartphone in this segment with this sort of dual camera feature. If that doesn't matter and you’re looking for a bit more power under the hood, then you always have the Moto G5 Plus. The Oppo F3 is a good upgrade over the Oppo F1s, but there are areas that could have used some improvement. FM radio is still absent, and many people in India use this form of entertainment even today. ColorOS 3.0 is beginning to feel a little dated now and there’s still no clarity on whether any of the new F3 series will get an update to even Nougat, considering that Google is gearing up for its Android O launch. Last but not least, the performance of both the front and rear cameras is not as good as with the F3 Plus.  At the end of the day, the Oppo F3 is meant for those who can't (or don't want to) spend a premium on the F3 Plus. It definitely is more affordable, but that's because of the compromises you have to make."

There’s also the A-series that’s often refreshed in India, but others like the R-series have been ignored Internationally, the top-end phone from Oppo right now is the R15, which doesn’t seem to be launching in India anytime soon. However, we have the next best thing here in the form of the Oppo F7. The latest selfie-centric model has a lot in common with the R15, such as the new MediaTek Helio P60 SoC, a high-resolution front camera, and of course, a notch. The Oppo F7 is also priced pretty aggressively, starting at Rs. 21,990, which actually undercuts the Vivo V9 (Review), another recent mid-range competitor. We were quite happy with Oppo’s last offering, the Oppo F5 (Review), so let’s see if the F7 can match or even exceed our expectations. We’ve usually been happy with the build quality and design of Oppo’s F-series smartphones, but the company is taking a new approach with the F7. Instead of the usual metal back panel, Oppo is using an all-plastic body. On one hand, the phone is very light at just 158g, but on the other, it doesn’t feel very premium anymore. Oppo has tried to remedy this with a glossy coat of paint for the sides, which looks alright on the Diamond Black and Platinum Silver versions, but not so much on the Solar Red variant that we had for review. On the back, Oppo has used a piece of polymer composite material. In our initial impressions of the Oppo F7, we found the rear panel to scratch pretty easily, however this wasn't a problem with the retail unit that we received for review. That said, it’s not impervious to dents, and applying slight pressure with even a SIM eject tool caused a visible abrasion. On the front, we have a 6.23-inch in-cell IPS display with a resolution of 1080x2280 pixels, and Gorilla Glass 5. Due to the notch at the top of the screen, the Oppo F7 falls into the 19:9 aspect ratio category. The company has used this space quite cleverly, which we’ll get into in the next section. The display doesn’t curve at the sides, and there’s still a bit of a chin at the bottom. Within the notch, Oppo has made room for the earpiece, front camera, and a couple of sensors, but the notification LED has been dropped. This phone ships with a screen guard preinstalled, which is quite annoying as the edges aren't aligned with with the edges of the display, so it rubs against your fingertips every time you try to pull down the notifications shade or swipe from the sides.     The buttons are easy to reach. At the bottom, we have a single speaker grille, a Micro-USB port, and a 3.5mm headphone socket. The speaker grille gets blocked by your palm easily when you’re playing a game or watching a video in landscape mode. We’re still disappointed about the lack of a Type-C port here, and we reached out to Oppo for an explanation as to why this decision was made. In an emailed statement, the company said ""A large number of users are using the current USB ports so this would be more convenient for users"". The SIM tray is placed on the right, and can hold two Nano-SIMs and a microSD card (up to 256GB). There’s a fingerprint sensor at the back, along with a single camera. In the Oppo F7 box, you get a 10W charger, a USB cable, a silicone case, and a headset. The Oppo F7 uses the new MediaTek Helio P60 octa-core SoC, which is the same one used in the Oppo R15. It’s based on ARM’s big.LITTLE architecture, marrying four high-performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores with four power-efficient Cortex-A53 cores. It's manufactured using a 12nm FinFET fabrication process, and has an integrated Mali-G72 MP3 graphics processor. More importantly though, this SoC also has dedicated AI processing logic which promises more secure facial recognition and real-time HDR, two features that Oppo has implemented in the F7. For long, MediaTek has generally been associated with low-cost smartphones, although the Helio series has performed much better. The new P60 is actually more powerful than even Qualcomm’s competing Snapdragon 626 and 636 SoCs. We got a score of 135,279 in AnTuTu 7, and 37fps in GFXbench's T-Rex test.     The Oppo F7 version that we tested has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, but the F7 is also available in a version with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage, which is priced at Rs. 26,990. Other specifications include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, USB-OTG, FM radio, and 4G VoLTE. The F7 also features an ambient light sensor, accelerometer, proximity sensor, Hall sensor, and a gyroscope. There's a non-removable 3400mAh battery. The new Oppo F7 ships with Android Oreo 8.1 out of the box, but it’s hard to recognise it with all the customisations that have been made. Oppo’s ColorOS 5.0 UI has some familiar gestures and tweaks from past iterations, along with some new ones. First off, we have to say that we’re not big fans of the new default theme. The icons are unnecessarily chunky and make the UI feel dated. The Theme Store app doesn't offer many choices, and we only found a couple of options that were good enough to use. Another annoyance with the UI is the fact that you can’t swipe a notification away. Instead, you have to swipe left and hit ‘Delete’, which just adds an unnecessary step to the process. The fingerprint sensor works well and is quick at authentication. It can also be used for unlocking apps, and a secure space within your phone’s internal storage. Oppo is making a big deal about its new face unlock implementation, which is said to map and recognise 128 points on a registered face. In practice, we found that it worked pretty well, and was quick most of the time. There’s a ‘raise to wake’ option, and in low light, the screen gets brighter in an attempt to illuminate your face. We weren’t able to fool it with a 2D picture, and it worked even when we had sunglasses on. The latter is possible because the Oppo F7 doesn’t scan your eyes, which makes it slightly less secure. Other phones such as the Vivo V9 require your eyes to be open for face recognition to work.    You can ditch the on-screen navigation keys in favour of gestures, if you want an iPhone X-like experience. Once enabled, you get little horizontal markers at the bottom of the display as a placeholder. A swipe up takes you to the home screen, while swiping upwards and then holding for a few moments brings up the app switcher. You can swipe up from either the left or right edges to go a step back. There are different gesture styles to choose from, depending on your preference. As we stated earlier, Oppo has implemented some nifty shortcuts that take advantage of the screen space to either side of the notch. If you enable the Fullscreen Multitasking feature, you can access features called Quick Apps and Quick Function. Quick Apps lets you add shortcuts for some apps to the right of the notch, and on the left, there will be controls for beginning a screen recording, taking a screenshot, and toggling DND mode. These can be accessed when the phone is in landscape mode, by swiping inwards from the notch area. We found that the shortcuts were accessible when watching YouTube videos, and even streaming through apps like Prime Video and Netflix, but not in most of the games we tried (only Asphalt 8: Airborne showed them) and when watching local video files in MX Player or the stock video app. In apps that support it, the Quick Apps feature lets you access apps within a floating window so you can do things like send a message without exiting the app you're in. The notch area is also used as to alert you when there’s a background app that’s using the microphone, or if a split-screen app is running in the background. Security features include a secure keyboard, which renders as overlay on top of Gboard and is claimed to keep your keystrokes private, although it feels a bit clunky. You can spoof your identifying information such as contacts, if apps require permissions to access them in order to work. Kids Space lets you limit the apps your little ones have access to when you hand them the phone. Oppo Cloud gives you 5GB of free cloud storage for backups, while Game Acceleration is supposed to adjust system resources for better gameplay. You get a tonne of toggle switches in the notifications shade, including shortcuts for Google Now, the camera, screen recording, and Oppo share, which can be used to send files over Wi-Fi to nearby Oppo phones. Stock apps include Oppo’s own app store, a file manager, and an app for migrating data over to another phone. The low weight of the Oppo F7 makes it very comfortable to use every day. However, the glossy back and sides make it a major fingerprint magnet so it’s a real pain to keep clean. We’re not big fans of the new design, and we think the older F5 still looks and feels more premium. We didn’t have any trouble with 4G reception and call quality is good in all the areas we tested it in. We’re also happy to report that the F7 runs fairly cool in most use cases. Even when gaming outdoors on a hot day, the back of the phone only got a bit warm at best, which is great. The speaker doesn’t get too loud when playing media files, but alerts were quite audible. Most of the apps we tested worked well with the 19:9 display. In apps that don’t have native support, you get a little prompt to stretch them to fullscreen. Some of the themes in Oppo's Theme Store weren't notch-ready and had alignment issues. In some games, on-screen items can be obscured when running in fullscreen mode.    The headset looks a lot like Apple’s EarPods but they don’t sound all that great. The Oppo F7 has an audio enhancement feature called Real Original Sound developed by Oppo and Dirac. It helps lift the mids and low-end frequencies a bit, but it isn’t very noticeable with the bundled headset. You can also create a custom EQ preset. There’s a Headphones Monitor toggle that is said to provide a “live karaoke experience through the headphones,” but we didn’t find much use for it. The phone handles most popular video and audio codecs, but it struggled to play 4K video files smoothly. Being an F-series phone, there's a lot of focus on the front camera of the Oppo F7. Oppo has picked a 25-megapixel Sony sensor, with an f/2.0 aperture. The F7 also boasts of AI Beauty and Sensor HDR capabilities. AI Beauty only works with the front camera, and lets the algorithms do the work of judging how much beautification is needed. Most of the time, we found that it worked quite well, but there were instances when it went a bit wrong. You can manually choose the level of beautification too, along with various filters. It also now works with other parts of your body too, like your neck. Sensor HDR gives you a preview of the final shot before it’s actually taken. In practice, it works well with barely any shutter lag. There are some AR stickers too, which are fun to play around with. Image quality is very good in daytime shots, and the camera manages to retain good detail and colour even indoors. The screen flash is fairly effective, and even in low light, we managed to get bright and clear selfies, with little to no noise on our subjects' faces. There’s a depth effect mode, which does a decent job with edge detection, and the level of blurring is usually managed well. You can even use a palm gesture to take shots. Tap to see full-sized Oppo F7 camera samples   The rear camera has a 16-megapixel sensor with an f/1.8 aperture, which manages to capture decent details in stills, provided there’s sufficient light. Focusing is quick during the day, but does dip a bit in low light. Macros are also handled well, with nicely saturated colours, and the same holds true to an extent even in low light. Landscapes at night lose a bit of detail, and objects in the distance lack good definition if you zoom in. The camera app allows 2x zooming (except in Panorama mode) but we don’t recommend this as it’s essentially just digital zoom, in which you lose out on clarity. Expert mode lets you tinker around with the ISO, shutter speed, etc, and you can also switch on Ultra HD, which stitches four consecutive shots into a single higher-resolution frame (6212x9216 pixels). The Super Vivid toggle switch bumps up the contrast, which is useful when shooting close-ups of food etc, but it can make landscapes look artificial, especially when combined with HDR. Oddly, the phone doesn’t support 4K video recording, as the maximum resolution is 1080p. There’s no electronic stabilisation either, so it’s best not to move around too much when you shoot. Even slight hand shakes are noticeable in the final output, and even with ample light, we noticed a bit of focus hunting when panning. You don’t get additional modes for video either, such as slow-motion. The camera app is easy to use and that’s because the layout is heavily inspired by iOS. Battery life one of Oppo F7’s strong suits, and during regular usage, we had no trouble getting about a day and half worth of runtime on a single charge. With heavier usage, battery life does reduce, but the Oppo F7 should still comfortably last you through a full day. Charging is a bit slow as even with the 10W charger, we only managed get to about 23 percent in half an hour. The F7 doesn’t support Oppo’s VOOC flash charging standard. We also didn’t like the fact that ColorOS doesn't have a battery usage graph, which is typically found in the Settings app. There’s no option for battery management in the Phone Manager app either. You get a simple Power Saving toggle switch, but there’s no way to customise that mode. Oppo F7 in pictures   VerdictThe Oppo F7 is a good upgrade over the F5 in terms of battery life and SoC performance. The selfie camera is also easily one of the best in this phone's price range, and new additions like the Sense HDR mode and AI Beauty work well most of the time. We’re not big fans of the aesthetics as it’s a task to keep this phone looking good. The plastic body also takes away the premium feeling that most previous F-series phones prided themselves on. ColorOS doesn’t have a fresh enough design either, and Oppo might have gone a bit overboard with the customisations, which we don’t appreciate. Oppo has used the area around the notch well, so it’s not simply there for aesthetic value. Between this and the Vivo V9, we’d recommend the Oppo F7 as it is better in terms of battery life, camera quality, and CPU performance. If you need something more feature-rich, there’s also the Moto X4 (Review) at around the same price, which has much better build quality than both the Vivo and Oppo models, and even has waterproofing. Do Oppo F7 and Vivo V9 show what to expect from OnePlus 6?

2342,21,oppo-f9-pro-review-1911150,7,10,2018-09-27,1911150,Jamshed Avari,Oppo F9 Pro Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/oppo-f9-pro-review-1911150," The Oppo F9 Pro is a phone for those who want to be noticed. In a world of increasingly generic-looking phones, and manufacturers all racing to copy the same design cues, Oppo has decided to be a little different. The F9 Pro is instantly noticeable and recognisable, no matter which of its three very different finishes you choose - and no, there is no sober, low-key option. If you want something that will work unobtrusively in a corporate environment, or if you don't like getting curious glances when you're out in public, there are plenty of other smartphones that will suit you better. While looks will be the primary consideration for buyers, Oppo is prioritising fashion as well as features. There's a new, more subtle notch; the promise of excellent battery life plus quick charging; and of course Oppo's usual emphasis on selfies. All these things combined might earn the F9 Pro a few fans - and it needs to play up every advantage it can draw on, now that the Poco F1 (Review) has completely rewritten the rules of the Rs. 20,000 - 30,000 price bracket. Unlike most phones these days, the emphasis here is on the back. Oppo has come up with three extremely eye-catching finishes for the F9 Pro, all of which are multi-coloured, patterned, and shimmery. The Sunrise Red finish, which you can see on our review unit, has a gradient of rich, deep crimson and violet, with a swirly diamond pattern. The Twilight Blue option has a similar pattern but the colour runs from dark navy to light blue - it's amusing to think that this is the most low-key. Finally, Starry Purple has a mangenta-indigo gradient with light speckles scattered randomly across it. All three have an iridescent metallic finish, and at least on our Sunrise Red unit, the colours look different depending on the light and the angle you hold each phone at. The diamond pattern isn't always visible, but as you turn this phone in your hand, or if light happens to hit it in just the right spot, it will suddenly pop out. Oppo includes a completely transparent rubber case in the retail box, so you can show your F9 Pro off even if you like having some extra protection. That isn't all though. Oppo has managed to tone down the notch that we've all now gotten used to, and so instead of a 'tab' shape with 'ears' to either side, there's only a slight rounded dip in the centre of the top of the screen to accommodate the front camera. Oppo calls this a 'waterdrop' shape, and while it is definitely more organic (and, to many people, stylish) than what we're used to, it's no less distracting. Interestingly, while you can still force apps to block off the top of the screen in order to prevent content from being gouged out, there's no way to camouflage the notch within a black bar on a system-wide level.    One of the ways that Oppo managed to reduce the notch was with a clever bit of design. It might seem like the borders on the top and sides of the screen are extremely narrow, and in fact Oppo claims a 90.8 percent screen-to-body ratio. However, the frame of the phone bulges slightly outwards around the front panel, masking about 1mm of space on all sides. The earpiece is designed into this margin, right above the front camera. This also means that the multi-coloured body is visible all around the black front, even when looking at the phone head-on. The frame of the Oppo F9 Pro isn't metal, and the company hasn't specified whether it has used reinforced glass for the front and rear, which is quite disappointing at this price level. Oppo has stuck a scratch protector onto the front of the F9 Pro, and it says that third-party ones might interfere with the hidden ambient light sensor. The film doesn't extend till the edges of the F9 Pro's front face, creating a distracting border around the screen and diminishing the smooth curve of the waterdrop notch. Our review unit's film got scuffed badly within just a few days of use, and the harshest conditions we exposed it to were the insides of our pockets. The dual camera module on the rear sticks out a little and there's a rough lip around the front face, but otherwise construction feels solid. This is a reasonably easy phone to hold and use, and at 169g, it isn't too heavy. You'll still have to stretch your thumbs to reach all corners of the screen though. There's no dust or splash resistance. The power button on the right and volume buttons on the left are within easy reach, as is the fingerprint sensor on the rear. We were surprised to see a Micro-USB port on the bottom rather than a more modern Type-C port, but this is required for Oppo's VOOC rapid charging system. There's also a 3.5mm headset jack and a single speaker on the bottom. The tray on the left has individual slots for two Nano-SIMs and a microSD card, which is always nice to see.  As we stated earlier, Xiaomi's Poco F1 has upset the applecart in the price band that Oppo has targeted for the F9 Pro, and its hardware will not seem impressive now. There's an octa-core MediaTek Helio P60 processor (incidentally, the same one that Oppo used on its own disruptively priced model introduced under a new sub-brand, the Realme 1 (Review), not too long ago). This SoC has an integrated ARM Mali-G72 GPU and boasts of AI processing and power efficiency enhancements. Oppo sells only one version of the F9 Pro, with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. However, the company has taken the unusual step of also announcing the Oppo F9, which is identical in every way other than having 4GB of RAM instead of 6GB. This model isn't available in stores yet, and the company has not said when it will be. We're quite surprised that there's a Rs. 4,000 price difference between these two models. (Update 27 September: While Oppo had said at the launch event that the F9 and F9 Pro are identical in all aspects other than the RAM, it has now come to light that the F9 has a 16-megapixel front camera instead of 25-megapixel on the F9 Pro, and the F9 also does not have VOOC rapid charging.) One of the F9 Pro's headlining features is its 3500mAh battery and support for Oppo's VOOC rapid charging standard. All the required circuitry is built into the charger rather than the phone, which Oppo says prevents the phone from heating up too much. You'll have to use the charger and modified USB cable that come with the phone, both of which are bulkier than usual. Oppo claims that being plugged in for five minutes will give you two hours' worth of talk time. Oppo has also used an LTPS (low-temperature polysilicon) LCD panel, which consumes less power but is expensive to manufacture. The panel measures 6.3 inches and has a 19.5:9 aspect ratio with a resolution of 1080x2340. The rest of the F9 Pro's specifications are pretty standard: Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, and VoLTE.    Oppo's ColorOS skin is now at version 5.2, and is based on Android 8.1. Our review unit had the July 2018 security patch, and Oppo hasn't committed to any schedule for future patches or Android updates. To say that ColorOS is heavily customised would be an understatement. There isn't an app drawer, and the icons on the homescreen are all comically large. There's a 'Smart Assistant' screen to the left of the first homescreen with widgets for app shortcuts, the weather, step tracking, events, etc. You can pull downwards to perform a systemwide search, just like on iOS. A floating panel gives you quick access to app shortcuts as well as screenshot tools. If you use it while watching a video in landscape, some apps can launch as floating windows. The settings app has a number of options to discover. You can swap around the on-screen navigation buttons or disable them and use gestures instead. There are assorted gestures and shortcuts. A Smart Driving mode can block notifications and calls, but you have to either turn it on manually or set it to trigger when your phone is connected to your car using Bluetooth. An interesting privacy feature is that you can choose to spoof your call history, contacts, messages and events if apps try to access them. Face recognition is supported but you have to wake your phone and then swipe upwards to trigger the front camera, which is an annoying extra step. There's a fair bit of bloatware, including UC Browser and Amazon Shopping. We were prompted to install more during the initial setup process, through an Oppo AppStore, and also through a 'Hot Apps' panel on the home screen that looks deceptively like an ordinary system folder. Oroaming is an app that claims to let users buy cheap roaming plans in multiple countries without needing a local SIM, but how this works is never really explained. The Theme Store has quite a few free themes and wallpapers.  The F9 Pro's full-HD+ resolution is enough to keep everything on screen looking crisp even at 6.3 inches. Colours are bright and vibrant, and viewing angles are also very good. We were able to use this phone outdoors without any trouble. The notch and rounded corners do result in quite a bit of cropping when watching videos full-screen. Unfortunately the built-in speaker is quite awful. Everything is screechy and distorted, and most of the music we tried listening to was not enjoyable at all. If you judge the Oppo F9 Pro only by its performance in benchmarks, it will come out looking quite weak. Setting aside the obviously more powerful Poco F1, this phone still doesn't compare favourably against similarly priced models such as the Honor Play (Review) and Huawei Nova 3i (Review). It's also outperformed by the lower priced Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review) and is of course on par with the even more affordable Realme 1. We got a score of 137,739 in AnTuTu, and Geekbench's single- and multi-core tests managed 1,348 and 5,305 respectively. Graphics test scores were disappointingly weak, with this phone scoring only 1,078 in 3DMark's Slingshot Extreme scene, and pushing out only 34fps in the basic GFXBench T-Rex test. Casual games seemed to run fine, but Asphalt 9:Legends struggled. Gameplay was a bit too choppy to be enjoyable, and even the UI and menus were sluggish. We tried PUBG and had a much better experience. It ran without any stutters using the Balanced preset. We also noticed that the upper rear of this phone got warm almost instantly when a heavy game loaded, and remained warm enough to be distracting throughout. It's safe to say that this phone isn't your best bet if you're serious about current-gen games. On the other hand, this phone's battery life is quite remarkable. With just a 3500mAh battery, the Oppo F9 Pro managed to run for 13 hours, 12 minutes in our HD video loop test. That's thanks to the low-power LTPS screen, the Helio P60 SoC's efficiency, and optimisations built into ColorOS. With ordinary use including some gaming, video streaming and plenty of time spent online, we easily sailed through a full day and didn't have to worry about the battery level till the next morning. The VOOC charger is enormous and will be a pain to carry around, but it works brilliantly. A 10-minute charge from zero took us up to 19 percent, and we were able to get to nearly 75 percent in just 40 minutes.  Oppo's camera app is somewhat like the iOS app, just with a lot more going on. The main mode ribbon at the bottom includes Timelapse, Slo-mo, Portrait, Sticker, Pano, and Expert modes along with the standard Photo and Video. Portrait mode was pretty fussy about prompting us to move closer to or farther away from our subjects. There are also ""lighting effects"" which are little more than mild filters. The Slow-mo and Timelapse video modes didn't have any options at all for us to tweak - not even the resolution. You get Google Lens integration in the standard Photo mode, along with beautification, filters, and a choice of aspect ratios. You can simulate a depth effect with the front camera, but it isn't very natural. The beautification mode is set to 'AI' by default, and we found it to be way too aggressive, making us look almost like cartoon characters. Selfies taken indoors weren't very impressive. In daylight, we found the app to be responsive, locking focus quickly. Our sample shots looked crisp, with good colours and adequate detail. In portrait mode, the app often took a few moments to settle the difference between foreground and background objects, but we were able to see the effect on screen and decide when to capture our shots. Tap to see full-sized Oppo F9 Pro camera samples   At night, there was quite a bit of focus lag. Shots came out with murky details and a lot of blurring when dealing with even slightly moving objects. Most of our sample photos were very well lit, but strong post-processing appeared to have taken its toll on overall quality. These shots looked fine on the phone's screen, but weren't suitable for use at full size. The front camera is usually one of Oppo's biggest highlights, but in this case we weren't terribly impressed. Faces looked sharp, but background details were completely lost. The depth effect made backgrounds look a little cartoony, which might not be a bad thing, and edge detection was fairly good. Selfies taken at night were grainy and we wouldn't want to show them off on our social media. You have a choice between 720p and 1080p for video recording with the rear cameras, and there are no settings to play with. We saw a lot of focus shifting, and the lack of stabilisation was evident throughout our sample clips. Overall, we're somewhat disappointed with the Oppo F9 Pro's camera capabilities. Oppo F9 Pro in pictures   VerdictThe Oppo F9 Pro reminds us of the early 2000s when Nokia, Samsung, Sony Ericsson, and others used to come up with wildly imaginative designs all the time. Very few phones these days take any risks with colours, patterns, shapes or materials. The ones that do are usually trying to be high-end and sophisticated, leaving no room for edgy or whimsical options. Oppo obviously knows that the F9 Pro's aesthetic won't be for everyone, but that's okay. People who are most concerned with practicality have plenty of other choices anyway. If a bright red and purple phone makes you happy, then by all means, go for it. Our biggest question is whether buyers will be willing to prioritise this design over performance. The Oppo F9 Pro does deliver great battery life and a reasonable overall usage experience, but it isn't the best you can get for your money by a long shot. We would have at least liked a metal body, weatherproofing, and basic video stabilisation at this price. Better cameras would also have made us more forgiving. The Oppo F9 priced at Rs. 4,000 less comes across as much better value for money. Most people can live quite happily with 4GB of RAM rather than 6GB, and if you're most concerned about Fortnite gaming performance for example, you should be looking elsewhere anyway. (Update 27 September: You will, of course, also lose out on VOOC fast charging if you buy the Oppo F9.) Also, while the base variant of the Poco F1 is a clear outlier in this price band (and will be difficult to buy for the foreseeable future), we can't ignore how much value it offers."
2355,21,realme-1-review-1852856,8,10,2018-05-17,1852856,Shobhit Varma,Realme 1 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/realme-1-review-1852856," According to Oppo, its new Realme sub-brand has been conceived with the Indian youth in mind. Realme smartphones will be sold exclusively online (and only via Amazon India as of now) and will be priced between Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 20,000. With the new Realme 1, Oppo plans to take on Xiaomi's might in the budget smartphone segment. The Realme 1 starts at just Rs. 8,990 and has an 18:9 display, up to 6GB of RAM, a fibreglass body with a unique design, and Android 8.1 Oreo out of the box. The phone seems to have been designed specifically to be a Redmi Note 5 Pro killer, and Oppo's marketing makes that very apparent. Does the Realme 1 have what it takes to stand out in the brutally competitive budget smartphone market? Let's find out.    The Realme 1 has a fibreglass body with a glossy diamond-cut effect on the back. Oppo says that there are 15 tangent planes carved onto the back panel to reflect light in different ways and make the smartphone ""look like a diamond"". While the design is definitely unique and snazzy, it might come across as a bit ostentatious and gaudy to some. One problem with the fibreglass material is that it gets smudged with fingerprints extremely easily. Thanks to the impressive 84.75 percent screen-to-body ratio, the Realme 1 is very compact and pocketable.The screen is not exactly borderless but the front of this phone does look sleek and modern. Despite the frame being made of plastic, the build quality is top-notch. We dropped the Realme 1 numerous time during our review period and it did not suffer any significant damage.    The rear camera module on the Realme 1 barely protrudes from the chassis. The left of the smartphone has the volume rocker which is ergonomically placed and easy to use. The power button and the SIM tray are on the right. While many models in this price range have hybrid dual-SIM trays, the Realme 1 has dedicated slots for two Nano-SIMs and a microSD card. A fingerprint sensor is conspicuous by its absence. Instead, the Realme 1 relies on facial recognition for security, plus of course the usual passcode options. Face recognition works quite well for the most part, but struggles in direct sunlight and when lighting is not favourable. The setup process is also a bit slow, and not the most intuitive. The Realme 1 has extremely impressive specifications for the price. It's powered by the octa-core MediaTek Helio P60 processor clocked at 2.0GHz. This makes it not only a competitor to the Redmi 5, but also to the much more expensive Redmi Note 5 Pro. MediaTek's flagship processor is fabricated using a 12nm process and features NeuroPilot AI technology which can handle deep learning for facial detection as well photo and video enhancement. There are three variants of the smartphone on offer - one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage priced at Rs. 8,990; one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage (which will go on sale in June) priced at Rs. 10,990; and the variant we've reviewed here with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage priced at Rs. 13,990. You can expand the storage using a microSD card of up to 256GB. In terms of pricing, we'd say that the Realme 1 offers excellent value, especially with the entry-level variant.    The Realme 1 features a 6-inch full-HD+ (1080x2160 pixels) display with an aspect ratio of 18:9. The display is very reflective and viewing angles are disappointing. That said, colours are vibrant and the screen is bright enough for outdoor use. We're glad to see that there's no notch, which has quickly become a highly polarising trend. The Realme 1 has a non-removable 3410mAh battery and runs Color OS 5.0 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo. Connectivity options include dual 4G VoLTE, Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. You also get FM radio and GPS/ A-GPS. At a time when the industry is moving towards USB Type-C, this smartphone uses the age-old Micro-USB port for charging and data transfers. The phone supports dual standby for VoLTE. During our review period, the 6GB RAM variant of the smartphone handled everything we threw at it with aplomb - from basic day-to-day tasks such as taking pictures, browsing the Web, using social media applications, and watching videos, to intensive workloads like recording videos in full-HD. It even handled both casual games like Subway Surfers and heavy titles like Asphalt 8 without any dropped frames or stutters. The Realme 1 did not get too warm when when pushed. Oppo claims that the Helio P60 outperforms the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 in the AnTuTu benchmark. To put that claim to the test, we ran the benchmark for ourselves. The Realme 1 managed an impressive 138,326 points in AnTuTu. The more expensive Redmi Note 5 Pro, which is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor, managed a score of 105,369 in comparison. Other benchmark scores were equally impressive. The Realme 1 managed 38fps in GFXbench T-Rex, and12fps in the more demanding GFX Bench Manhattan 3.1 graphics tests. It also gave us scores of 8,009 in PC Mark Work 2.0, and 1,513 and 5,795 respectively in Geekbench's single- and multi-core tests. You can see how that compares with Snapdragon 636-powered phones like Redmi Note 5 Pro and ZenFone Max Pro M1.    The Realme 1 runs Oppo's highly modified Color OS 5.0 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo. While animations are snappy and the interface is fluid, it is extremely cluttered and in dire need of simplification. The Settings app and quick launch panel in particular are quite hard to navigate around. There is no app drawer, and the Google Now panel has been replaced by a custom screen that displays the weather, steps taken, favourite contacts, and recent events. On a positive note, third-party bloat is minimal. There are also a host of nifty features, such as dual apps, a three-finger screenshot shortcut, a theming app, and lockscreen gestures. There is no information as of now regarding plans for an Android P update. Battery life is quite impressive. In our HD video loop battery test, the smartphone lasted 11 hours and 30 minutes. In terms of real-world performance, we never found ourselves reaching for the charger before midnight after having used the phone quite heavily all day. The Realme 1 does not support quick charging though, and a full charge takes around 2.5 to 3 hours, which is average at best. On the imaging front, the Realme 1 has a 13-megapixel rear camera with a single-LED flash, and an 8-megapixel front camera. The company claims that it can recognise 296 facial points, and that artificial intelligence features are baked in. The iOS-like camera app is easy to use and offers a wide variety of modes such as Panorama, Time-lapse, and AR sticker. There is a fully featured Pro mode as well, which allows you to alter the shutter speed, ISO, exposure, aperture, and white balance. The AI based selfie camera automatically detects skin tone, skin type, age, and gender, and optimises image settings accordingly. Oppo claims that it has eight million beauty reference points in its database. In our experience, the front camera produced decent photos in well-lit scenarios but struggled in low light. The AI beautification really softened facial features and added an unpleasant watercolour-like effect. Tap to see full-sized Realme 1 camera samples   Both the rear and front camera are capable of capturing bokeh shots using software algorithms. The resultant images are nothing to write home about, with poor edge detection and details. The 13-megapixel rear camera features AI-based scene recognition which allows it to optimise settings for different scenes and objects in real-time. It pulls in a decent amount of detail but images look slightly dull. The sensor has poor dynamic range and struggles with detail and auto-focus in low light. Video recording maxes out at 1080p for both the front and rear cameras. Videos are good enough for social media use but lack detail and are not stabilised. AR stickers are implemented quite well, and are a fun and quirky way to impress friends. There are 14 stickers to choose from, and the feature can be used with both the front as well as the rear camera. Realme 1 in pictures   VerdictThe Realme 1 features a unique design - which not everyone may appreciate - superb performance (on the 6GB RAM variant we reviewed), good battery life, a dedicated microSD card slot, and a decent display. The lack of a fingerprint sensor, the cluttered software, and the average cameras however prevent the Realme 1 from becoming the absolute best on offer in this segment. Having said that, the variants with 3GB and 4GB of RAM, which are priced at Rs. 8,999 and Rs. 10,999 respectively, offer stunning value for money and are sure to give Xiaomi a few sleepless nights, though we haven't had the chance to test them, so we wouldn't give them a whole-hearted recommendation. Oppo is positioning the Realme brand as a Xiaomi killer, and if the Realme 1 is anything to go by, Xiaomi has some intense competition to look forward to in the coming months. While Oppo claims that this smartphone will not be sold via flash sales, there's no way to know how many units the company will have in stock when the device first becomes available. Demand is sure to be high, and we wouldn't be surprised if it goes out of stock very quickly. Is Oppo Realme 1 better than Redmi Note 5 Pro, Zenfone Max Pro M1?

2355,21,realme-1-review-1852856,8,10,2018-05-17,1852856,Shobhit Varma,Realme 1 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/realme-1-review-1852856," According to Oppo, its new Realme sub-brand has been conceived with the Indian youth in mind. Realme smartphones will be sold exclusively online (and only via Amazon India as of now) and will be priced between Rs. 10,000 and Rs. 20,000. With the new Realme 1, Oppo plans to take on Xiaomi's might in the budget smartphone segment. The Realme 1 starts at just Rs. 8,990 and has an 18:9 display, up to 6GB of RAM, a fibreglass body with a unique design, and Android 8.1 Oreo out of the box. The phone seems to have been designed specifically to be a Redmi Note 5 Pro killer, and Oppo's marketing makes that very apparent. Does the Realme 1 have what it takes to stand out in the brutally competitive budget smartphone market? Let's find out.    The Realme 1 has a fibreglass body with a glossy diamond-cut effect on the back. Oppo says that there are 15 tangent planes carved onto the back panel to reflect light in different ways and make the smartphone ""look like a diamond"". While the design is definitely unique and snazzy, it might come across as a bit ostentatious and gaudy to some. One problem with the fibreglass material is that it gets smudged with fingerprints extremely easily. Thanks to the impressive 84.75 percent screen-to-body ratio, the Realme 1 is very compact and pocketable.The screen is not exactly borderless but the front of this phone does look sleek and modern. Despite the frame being made of plastic, the build quality is top-notch. We dropped the Realme 1 numerous time during our review period and it did not suffer any significant damage.    The rear camera module on the Realme 1 barely protrudes from the chassis. The left of the smartphone has the volume rocker which is ergonomically placed and easy to use. The power button and the SIM tray are on the right. While many models in this price range have hybrid dual-SIM trays, the Realme 1 has dedicated slots for two Nano-SIMs and a microSD card. A fingerprint sensor is conspicuous by its absence. Instead, the Realme 1 relies on facial recognition for security, plus of course the usual passcode options. Face recognition works quite well for the most part, but struggles in direct sunlight and when lighting is not favourable. The setup process is also a bit slow, and not the most intuitive. The Realme 1 has extremely impressive specifications for the price. It's powered by the octa-core MediaTek Helio P60 processor clocked at 2.0GHz. This makes it not only a competitor to the Redmi 5, but also to the much more expensive Redmi Note 5 Pro. MediaTek's flagship processor is fabricated using a 12nm process and features NeuroPilot AI technology which can handle deep learning for facial detection as well photo and video enhancement.

2357,21,realme-2-pro-review-1923049,8,10,2018-09-27,1923049,Roydon Cerejo,Realme 2 Pro Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/realme-2-pro-review-1923049," Chinese smartphone makers seem to be following a new trend of creating sub-brands that cater to demanding younger buyers. In the past, we’ve seen Honor from Huawei and Zuk by Lenovo, and most recently, we’ve had Poco by Xiaomi. Now, Realme has been spun off from Oppo. All of them seem to have a singular focus — offering very competitive specifications. Realme, now a separate company, has similar plans with its latest launch, the Realme 2 Pro, which it teased during the launch of the Realme 2 (Review). The Pro moniker in the name suggests that the phone has powerful hardware, and once again, the target audience seems to be students and millennials. The Realme 2 Pro ticks all the right boxes on paper, but it’s now time to see how it actually performs, and whether it can keep up with the competition.    Holding it in one hand, the Realme 2 Pro feels pretty big. We struggled a bit with one-handed use but the phone itself isn’t too heavy. It’s a bit on the thicker side at 8.5mm, but the rounded polycarbonate edges offer a comfortable grip. The back of the phone has multiple layers of lamination which give it the feel of a glass panel, or as Realme calls it, a “crystal-like dewdrop effect”. The body attracts plenty of smudges and fingerprints, but it’s said to offer some resistance against heat and scratches. The latter claim might not be very true, as our review unit picked up scuffs after just a couple of days of ordinary use. The 6.3-inch full-HD+ display is protected by Gorilla Glass 3 and has rounded edges and fairly slim bezels all around. However, the glass doesn’t wrap around the sides as seamlessly as we would have liked, which makes the edges a bit rough to the touch. This is made worse by the edges of the pre-applied screen protector. The ‘dewdrop’ notch design seems to be gaining popularity as it takes up the smallest footprint, and aesthetically, it looks really good. Due to the small size though, there’s just enough room for the front camera and there’s no notification LED. The earpiece is placed just above the front camera, while the sensors are placed to the right. The Realme 2 Pro features a laminated back and a non-removable 3500mAh battery   The power and volume buttons are on opposite sides of the phone, and line up well with your fingers. The SIM tray can accommodate two Nano SIMs and there’s a dedicated slot for a microSD card too (up to 256GB). The phone is said to support dual 4G with VoLTE, but this is something we couldn’t test as our pre-release review unit had been sourced from Vietnam. Dual 4G worked when we used two Airtel SIMs, but there wasn’t any toggle for VoLTE. Realme tells us that retail units in India will indeed have full support for dual 4G with VoLTE. At the bottom, we have a single speaker grille, a Micro-USB port, and a 3.5mm headphone socket. It’s easy to block the speaker when holding the phone in landscape mode. The fingerprint sensor is placed at the back, and is very quick at authentication. We didn’t face any mis-reads either. The dual-camera module protrudes a bit from the back, but we didn’t notice any scratches on the glass during our usage. In the box, you get a 10W charger, a Micro-USB cable, a SIM eject tool, a silicone case, and some instruction leaflets. The specifications of the Realme 2 Pro are pretty solid. All variants get the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 SoC, which is a powerful octa-core chip. Up until now, the only phones priced below Rs. 20,000 that it has been seen in have been the Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review) and the recently introduced Vivo V9 Pro. Benchmark numbers attest to its capabilities, and AnTuTu returned a good score of 1,31,968 points while in the GFXbench T-rex gaming test, we got a score of 39fps. The phone is available in three RAM and storage configurations to suit your budget. You have a choice between 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage; 6GB of RAM with 64GB of storage; and the one we have, which has 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. The top-end variant of the Realme 2 Pro is the first phone in this price segment to have 8GB of LPDDR4X RAM. Other specifications include Bluetooth 5, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, USB-OTG, a gyroscope, an ambient light sensor, a proximity sensor, a compass, and an accelerometer. There’s no FM radio or NFC. ColorOS 5.2 ships with some handy gestures and utilities like Smart Sidebar    The Realme 2 Pro runs on ColorOS 5.2, which is based on Android 8.1, and we were glad to see the recent September security patch. There’s a slight learning curve here, unless you’re coming from an Oppo phone. The latest version of ColorOS still has the annoying two-step process for dismissing a notification, but other than that, it’s quite polished. It also offers plenty of gestures and customisation options. Our unit had a lot of Vietnamese apps pre-installed, which obviously won't be present on Indian units, but we can’t tell whether some other bloatware will come in their place. In addition to the fingerprint sensor, the phone also supports face recognition. It’s really quick at authentication, and works only when your eyes are open so it’s more secure than some of the other implementations. The screen lights up for assistance in dark environments. You can enable face recognition for securing apps and a private space within the phone’s storage, as well as unlocking the phone itself. Smart Sidebar is a handy utility that gives you a slide-out panel from the edge of the screen for quick access to apps like the File Manager and Camera, and actions such as taking a screenshot. You can add shortcuts to your frequently used apps. The traditional navigation keys can be swapped out for gesture input, which works well. Some gestures are quite useful, such as the three-finger swipe up for entering split-screen mode, and a swipe down for taking a screenshot. We used the Realme 2 Pro for several days and quite honestly, we found little to complain about. Other than a few quirks of ColorOS, apps and the UI in general run smoothly. We didn’t notice any slowdowns when multitasking, and load times even for heavy games were pretty good. The display is very legible even under direct sunlight, as colours retain good saturation. The phone doesn’t heat up too much either. The upper back of the phone got a bit warm, but this was only after prolonged gaming or camera usage. Call quality was good, and there’s call recording built into the dialler app. The Realme 2 Pro features a tiny notch and slim bezels around the display   The Game Space app gives you the option to block notifications and free up memory automatically when you fire up a game. There’s a toggle switch for ‘Graphics acceleration,' which according to Realme, is currently best optimised for PUBG and Arena of Valor. We didn’t notice any real difference in image quality or gameplay smoothness in PUBG, as the game ran just fine even at ‘HD’ image quality and the framerate set to ‘High’. The same goes for Asphalt 9: Legends. The single speaker sounds tinny and isn’t very loud. You get Dirac sound enhancement for headphones but there’s nothing to amplify the volume of the speaker. All the games we tried filled up the entire screen, which means that the notch blocks some content. This this can be fixed by changing the scaling setting of each individual app in the Settings app, which prevents them from extending into the notch area. The Realme 2 Pro packs in a 16-megapixel main rear camera with a f/1.7 aperture, which captures good detail in daylight. In landscape shots, we noticed good dynamic range and colours, with plenty of details even in smaller objects, such as leaves on trees at a distance. The wide aperture produces a pleasing bokeh effect in close-up shots, which once again is handled well. We struggled to get a clear shot when shooting fast-moving objects such as pets due to slight shutter lag, but other than this, autofocus was quick. There’s a button for 2x zoom, which essentially does a digital zoom so it's not particularly helpful. Tap to see full-sized Realme 2 Pro camera samples   The second 2-megapixel sensor is only used for depth calculation. Images shot in the ‘Portrait’ mode look good, with good edge detection and sharpness on our subjects, even under artificial lighting at night. You can choose from a bunch of lighting effects as well. Photos shot in low light were a bit grainy, and details took a bit of a hit, especially in landscape shots. Close-ups lacked sharpness, but overall, we still ended up with usable shots. Video recorded at 1080p looked good. There’s electronic stabilisation, which works well, albeit with a slight shimmer effect in the video. 4K recording is supported and quality was good in daylight, but there’s no stabilisation. Video shot in low light was a bit grainy too. Other than the standard shooting mode and time-lapse, there aren’t any other options for video, such as slow-motion. The beautify mode works well if you set it manually, as the AI tends to be a bit aggressive with effects. Realme has used a 16-megapixel front sensor, and you can also make use of bokeh effects, HDR, and a screen flash. Image quality is decent but details could have been better. The screen flash is quite effective at illuminating your face but it messes up skin tones a bit. There’s a ‘Stickers’ shooting mode that lets you add different AR stickers to selfies or to other people’s faces. The 3500mAh battery easily lasted us through an entire day on a single charge, with ordinary usage that included a bit of gaming, streaming music, the usual social apps. We had two SIM cards in the phone. In our HD video loop test, we got a runtime of 10 hours and 22 minutes, which is slightly better than average. The Realme 2 Pro doesn’t support fast charging, but with the bundled adapter, we were able to get to roughly 64 percent in an hour, and it took about 2 hours and 20 minutes to charge completely from zero. VerdictThe Realme 2 Pro delivers well on its promise of being a powerful phone. We think that many people will see its appeal too, especially at the price of Rs. 17,990 for the version with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. This makes it very good value for money compared to the Mi A2 (Review) or even the recently launched Vivo V9 Pro, both of which sport the same Snapdragon 660 SoC. The less expensive variants which start at Rs. 13,990, are very competitive with phones such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review), Nokia 6.1 Plus (Review), Motorola One Power, the 6GB version of the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review) and even the 6GB version of the Realme 1 (Review).  The Realme 2 Pro has a lot going for it, mainly its sharp and vivid display, fast face unlock, neatly designed notch, good build quality, and solid app and gaming performance. Low-light still and video performance could have been better and we wish that Realme (and Oppo) would get rid of the annoying way that notifications are handled. Other than this, the Realme 2 Pro is a solid option under Rs. 20,000 if you’re looking for a good all-rounder."
2490,21,realme-3-pro-review-india-price-2025239,9,10,2019-04-22,2025239,Roydon Cerejo,Realme 3 Pro Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/realme-3-pro-review-india-price-2025239," Realme introduced its third-generation Realme 3 smartphone about a month ago in a bid to take on Xiaomi's Redmi Note 7. At the launch event, the company also teased the imminent arrival of a performance-oriented version of the phone, called the Realme 3 Pro. Unsurprisingly, this new model is pitted against the Redmi Note 7 Pro. Xiaomi has long been dominating the mainstream smartphone segment in India, which makes it the biggest competitor to Realme. The Realme 3 Pro has some pretty big shoes to fill, considering its predecessor, the Realme 2 Pro was and continues to be a solid option in its price segment. Going up against the Redmi Note 7 Pro won't be a cakewalk either, as Xiaomi has already set the bar pretty high with this phone by offering a 48-megapixel rear camera, glass body, and powerful internals starting at just Rs. 14,000. The Realme 3 Pro does have a few aces up its sleeve, and it's now time to find out if can triumph over its biggest rival. Let's get started.  At first glance, one could mistake the new Realme 3 Pro for the Realme 2 Pro as they both share a similar design as far as the display and button layout are concerned. Upon closer inspection though, certain differences become apparent. The most obvious one is the curved back panel, which tapers towards the sides, blending in with the phone's polycarbonate frame. The back panel on the Realme 3 Pro has slightly curved sides, which blends with the phone's side frame. The back panel is still made from injection-moulded plastic, but we do get some new colours along with a subtle pattern that's said to be inspired by a racetrack. The colour option we have for review is Nitro Blue, which has a dual-tone blue and purple finish, but you can also buy this phone in a more sober Carbon Grey, or another gradient finish called Lightning Purple. The Realme 3 Pro isn't too wide, which makes it comfortable to grip, but it is quite tall, so reaching the notification shade is usually a two-handed affair. At 172g, it doesn't feel too heavy, and at 8.3mm in thickness, it's easy to carry around in a pocket. The buttons are thoughtfully placed so they lined up with our fingers nicely, and there's a 3.5mm headphone socket, Micro-USB port, and a single speaker placed at the bottom. The Realme 3 Pro has slots for two Nano-SIM cards and a microSD card all at once, so there's no need to sacrifice a second SIM if you need to expand the storage. The Realme 3 Pro is available in some cool colour options   The 6.3-inch display has fairly slim bezels on all sides, except for the comparatively fat chin at the bottom. Realme uses an IPS panel here with a full-HD+ (1080x2340) resolution and Gorilla Glass 5. The display produces vivid colours, has good viewing angles, and sufficient brightness for legibility under sunlight. Just like the Realme 2 Pro, there's a notch on the top which houses the front camera, while the earpiece sits just above it. You also get a screen guard pre-applied. At the back, the Realme 3 Pro has a vertically stacked dual-camera module and a capacitive fingerprint sensor. The camera module does protrude slightly, but thankfully we didn't notice any of the chrome lining chipping off during our review. We deliberately used the phone without the bundled plastic case to see how the body would hold up against the wear and tear of everyday use. In over a week, it held up well but we did notice mild scuff marks along one of the bottom corners of the phone. The fingerprint sensor works well and there's face recognition too, which works fast just like on most other Realme devices. You don't get headphones in the box, but the Realme 3 Pro does ship with a fast charger, which is something Xiaomi still refuses to include with its Redmi offerings. This phone supports Oppo's VOOC 3.0 fast charging standard (20W) which is handy especially when you have a big 4045mAh battery. Realme's theme for the 3 Pro is ‘speed', and the company has been super aggressive with its choice of SoC. The is the first phone in this price segment to sport the Qualcomm Snapdragon 710 SoC. In terms of brute strength, the Snapdragon 675 in the Redmi Note 7 Pro still has slightly superior CPU power, but the 710 has an advantage with its better integrated graphics capabilities and its more power-efficient 10nm fabrication. In theory, it should allow for better battery life when using heavy apps such as the camera and when gaming. Realme 3 Pro ships with ColorOS 6, which is based on Android 9 Pie   Realme is offering two variants of the phone. You get 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage with the base variant and 6GB of RAM with 128GB of storage at the top-end, which is the variant we're reviewing. While the amount of storage you get should be plenty for most, you have the option of expanding it by up to 256GB by using a microSD card. The phone also supports dual 4G VoLTE, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 5, FM radio, USB-OTG, GPS, and the standard suite of sensors. The Realme 3 Pro runs on ColorOS 6, which is based on Android 9 Pie. It even comes with the March 2019 Android security patch. ColorOS 6 has a new look, and we saw it recently when we tested the Realme 3. You can change the navigation keys to a Google Pixel 3-style swipable button, or get rid of them altogether in favour of gestures. A quick swipe up from the home screen lets you access your app drawer, and like previous iterations of ColorOS, you get plenty of motion and screen gestures to play around with. Realme continues to preinstall quite a few third-party apps such as a Webnovel, NewsPoint, ShareChat, etc, but all of them can in uninstalled if needed. Realme Share is the company's answer to Apple's AirDrop. It lets you quickly share files between compatible Realme devices. You'll see this option when you try and share any file from the gallery. We tried it between the Realme 3 Pro and the Realme 3, and it worked well. We used the Realme 3 Profor a little over a week, and found general performance to be solid. The interface is speedy, and multitasking is handled well. Realme did point out that the firmware (RMX1851EX_11_A.1.0) on our review unit was still a pre-release version, and that retail units will have updated software with a few fixes and features added. The Realme 3 Pro has a noticeable chin but overall, packs in a nice design   One of the promised fixes is Widevine L1 DRM certification (our unit currently only has L3 certification) which will allow you to stream videos from apps such as Netflix, etc, at resolutions higher than HD. We were also promised a 960fps slow-motion video recording mode (which we later received via an update) and improved bokeh in the camera app in the final firmware. Media playback is handled well, and videos are rendered with punchy colours. Black levels are acceptable. The single speaker gets loud enough for media playback although we would have liked a second speaker for a proper stereo effect. The area to either side of the notch is generally hidden when watching videos but you can force apps to fill up all available space from within the Settings. Being a ‘Pro' model, we were expecting Realme to go with USB Type-C, but sadly we're still stuck with Micro-USB port. Heavy games run just fine too. PUBG Mobile defaulted to the High graphics preset and gameplay was smooth without any stuttering or lag. Other titles such as F1 Mobile and Asphalt 9: Legends also ran smoothly. The phone doesn't heat too much even after prolonged sessions, which is nice. The Realme 3 Pro might lack the large sensor of the Redmi Note 7 Pro but it still packs in a decently sized 16-megapixel Sony IMX519 sensor with an f/1.7 aperture. This is the same sensor used in some premium phones such as the OnePlus 6T (Review). There's also a secondary 5-megapixel depth sensor for the phone's Portrait mode. Tap to see full-sized Realme 3 Pro camera samples   The Realme 3 Pro captured very good details in landscape shots taken in daylight. Colours were slightly boosted, but this gives pictures a bit more ‘pop' especially when shooting in overcast conditions. We found the sharpness to be lacking a bit, even in some portions of a subject that was in focus, but this is only noticeable if you zoom in all the way. Macros were sharp and well detailed too, and the phone's AI scene recognition was quick to recognise most common objects such as flowers. In low light, the camera reduces its shutter speed considerably, all the way down to 1/10th of a second at times, due to which it's not easy to capture moving subjects such as pets. When your subject does stay still though, details are good. Landscapes on the other hand didn't look all that great when shooting in Auto mode. In very low light, focus was generally soft too. However, the phone's Nightscape mode comes in handy here. It takes a second or two longer than usual to capture your shot, but the end result is a sharper image with much better detail. Zooming in still reveals slightly blurry edges and washed-out textures, but as long as you're not cropping your image too much, the images are generally very usable. The depth sensor does a very good job with edge detection, and even in low light, we got a very pleasing bokeh effect.  The Realme 3 Pro's Nightscape mode in action (Tap for full size image)   The Realme 3 Pro has a 25-megapixel selfie camera with an f/2.0 aperture. Under good light, we managed to get some good shots, and HDR works well too if you're shooting against the light. However, in low light, images generally looked flat and a bit grainy. The phone does a pretty poor job applying bokeh effects for selfies, making them come across as artificial. The Realme 3 Pro can shoot video at up to 4K resolution but there's no stabilisation. In daylight, image quality is good, with decent colour reproduction. At night, the quality drops a bit but noise is still handled well. At 1080p resolution though, video is stabilised. The camera app has a simple design and is easy to use. The additional shooting modes that are available include Timelapse, Expert, Pano and Slo-mo. The phone also has a Chroma Boost mode, which bumps up the colours and brightness when shooting a backlit subject. The Realme 3 Pro received another firmware update just was we were wrapping up the review. There wasn't any changelog but the camera app did get the 960fps shooting mode. When you switch to Slow-mo from within the camera app, you can now choose between 120fps or 960fps. The former is shot at 1080p resolution while the latter is captured at 720p resolution. However, videos shot at 960fps don't scale to fit the screen when played back, even in landscape mode, leaving you with black bars on all sides of the video. You'll also have to time your shots well as there's no auto-capture feature and a few seconds worth of footage is stretched to a 10 second clip. Overall, quality is decent when shot under ample light. Battery life is solid. The 4045mAh battery lasted for 14 hours and 13 minutes in our HD video loop test, which is very good. With normal usage, which typically involved a bit of gaming, watching videos, using chat apps and surfing the Web, we easily managed to go beyond a full day on one charge. In fact, even gaming or using the camera didn't make a big dent in battery life, which was good to see. The VOOC fast charger can top up the battery from zero all the way to 90 percent in about an hour, which is impressive. One thing worth noting is that VOOC charging requires the bundled Micro-USB cable, and regular ones won't work. VerdictThe Realme 3 Pro is a good iterative update over the Realme 2 Pro (Review), and for a similar launch price as the last model, you get a bigger battery, slightly improved cameras, new colour options, and a more efficient SoC. Existing owners of the Realme 2 Pro shouldn't feel any need to upgrade, as the gains are not that significant. While the improvements we saw are welcome, Realme could have done a bit more to truly crush the Redmi Note 7 Pro (Review). We would have liked to see a USB Type-C port, a glass back, and maybe even an AMOLED display. Low-light camera performance for both the front and rear cameras could have been better too. If you're looking for a smartphone that's great for gaming for less than Rs. 20,000 then the Realme 3 Pro is a good place to start. You also get a good set of cameras, solid battery life, and a feature-packed OS, making it a good option to consider. In some respects, the Realme 3 Pro is better than the Redmi Note 7 Pro as the UI isn't spammy and there isn't any heating issues. On the other hand, the Redmi Note 7 Pro does feel a lot more premium thanks to the glass back. We're in the process of doing a detailed comparison of both the phones, so stay tuned for that as well, if you want help deciding between the two smartphones.

2478,21,realme-3-review-2002246,7,10,2019-03-05,2002246,Roydon Cerejo,Realme 3 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/realme-3-review-2002246," Realme seems to have struck the right chord with Indian audiences, having started its journey under Oppo, and soon breaking away to become an independent company. Since then, Realme has expanded its portfolio beyond phones to include audio and travel accessories as well. The company is also planning to set up exclusive retail stores in the second half of 2019, which shows its commitment to the Indian market. Now, the company has launched the next model in its main smartphone product line, simply called the Realme 3. The phone is the successor to the Realme 2 (Review) and is priced similarly too. However, in order to stay competitive, the company has given the new model a much-needed boost in CPU power. Add to that a new design language and updated software, and we have an interesting new choice at around the Rs. 10,000 mark. Let's see if the Realme 3 should be your top pick in this price segment.    The big change with the Realme 3's design compared to its predecessor is the presence of the waterdrop notch, which gives you a higher screen-to-body ratio. Realme is also touting its new ‘unibody' design for the back, which curves all the way to the sides without any visible seams. The back is made of injection moulded plastic rather than glass, but it feels rigid and comfortable to hold. The Realme 3 is not particularly light at 175g and not slim at 8.3mm, but weight distribution is good and there's ample surface on the sides for a good grip. Fingerprints are a real nightmare. The pre-applied screen guard and glossy back are impossible to keep clean. After a couple of days of usage, we also noticed some minor hairline scuff marks around the edges of the back. We have the Radiant Blue colour trim, but the Realme 3 is also available in Black and Dynamic Black. The upper three-fourths of the phone is black, while the blue gradient (purple at times, depending on the angle you hold it) is only towards the bottom fourth. The SIM tray can accommodate two Nano-SIM cards and a mciroSD card, all at once. 4G with Dual VoLTE is also supported. At the bottom, there's a 3.5mm headphone socket, Micro-USB port, and speaker. The Realme 3 has a sizeable chin at the bottom   The Realme 3 has a single 13-megapixel front-facing camera sitting in the notch, while the earpiece is placed just above it, with the sensors to the right. You get a fairly large 6.2-inch HD+ (720x1520 pixels) display, which also has Gorilla Glass protection, although Realme hasn't specified the version. The chin at the bottom of the phone is noticeably thicker than the ones on Realme's other recent offerings such as the Realme U1 (Review). The resolution is a little low for this size, considering the competition has moved to full-HD panels in this segment. As a result, images and text don't look their sharpest, but it's not bad enough to be a deal-breaker either. Colours look vivid and brightness is very good, so we had no trouble reading our emails even under direct sunlight. At the back, the Realme logo is now vertically aligned at the bottom, and up top, we have the two cameras, LED flash, and fingerprint sensor in the middle. The latter works well at authentication, but like past Realme phones, face unlock is just as fast if not quicker, and so that's what we relied on during our daily usage. Overall, the Realme 3 is a nice visual upgrade over the Realme 2, though we would have liked to see other improvements like a glass back or maybe even a USB Type-C port. The Realme 3 ships with a silicone case, SIM eject tool, data cable, and 10W charger. You don't get earphones in the box. The Realme 3's glossy back attracts plenty of smudges very easily   The specifications of the Realme 2 felt weird at the time of its launch, considering that the Realme 1 had a better SoC. Thankfully, the company has fixed this with the Realme 3. This new phone is powered by the MediaTek Helio P70 octa-core SoC, which incidentally made its debut in the Realme U1. There are two version of the Realme 3 — one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and the other with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Our review unit is the latter version. The Realme 3 also has single-band Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, USB-OTG, GPS, and the usual suite of sensors. FM radio is absent. The software finally gets a much-needed overhaul with ColorOS 6.0. This new Android skin is based on Android 9 Pie, and our unit had the January 2019 security patch. ColorOS hasn't been our favourite custom Android skin, if we're being honest, but the new version fixes quite a few things. The first thing that grabs your attention is the clean and minimalistic look of the OS. The icons look similar to what we've seen in older version of ColorOS but they are slightly smaller now, and somehow look more refined. The new version of the OS also stays true to some of Android 9 Pie's distinct features, such as the rounded, bubble-like design for menus, and the two-layer navigation system with an app drawer. To access recent apps, you simply long-swipe up and shift your thumb right or left over the home button to cycle between them. The toggle switches for Wi-Fi, etc in the notification shade are now oversized and easier to access. Pressing either volume button brings up the volume bar right next to it, which looks similar to MIUI 10 on Xiaomi phones. The Realme 3 ships with ColorOS 6.0, which is based on Android 9 Pie   Google's Digital Wellbeing feature in Android 9 Pie is not present. Another thing that's still missing is Android's battery level graph, which offers a visual representation of your usage over time, rather than just showing you a list of apps that have been used. Our unit had a bunch of preinstalled apps such as ShareChat, which is a content discovery app, Webnovel, and some social apps. All of these can be uninstalled if not needed. ColorOS's Game Space is present too, and gets new look. 'Riding Mode' has been added to the Smart Driving sub-menu, which when enabled, mutes all notifications except for for incoming calls. The MediaTek Helio P70 delivers good CPU and GPU performance for its class, which is is reflected in benchmarks. In AnTuTu, we managed to get a score of 1,36,619 points, and we also got 46fps in GFXbench's T-Rex graphics test. Benchmark numbers are generally higher than those of, say, the competing Snapdragon 660 which is found in phones such as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2. The new software and updated hardware make the Realme 3 a very nice phone to live with. We didn't encounter any unnecessary heating when using social and chat apps, which is a good sign. The phone handles multitasking very well and we didn't face any issues here. Despite the glossy back, this phone is surprisingly not too slippery without a case. However, fingerprints and smudges make it look dirty within couple of seconds of using it. The Realme 3 is a good phone to live with, despite its fingerprint-prone back   The phone fared well in gaming. We tested two of the most popular titles around — Asphalt 9: Legends and PUBG Mobile — both of which were fun to play. In Asphalt, we managed to get smooth framerates even with the graphics set to the ‘High' preset. PUBG Mobile ran well at the Medium graphics preset, with slight intermittent stutter every now and then. When gaming, the phone did get a little warm but this was nothing out of the ordinary. The Realme 3 does a good job with media files too. Animated films have good colour saturation and look lively. Blacks tend of crush a bit in dark scenes but overall, this is not bad for a HD+ display. The single speaker gets loud but sounds fairly average. Its position at the bottom also means it's easy to block it with your palm when holding the phone in landscape mode. The Realme 3 retains the 13-megapixel and 2-megapixel rear camera setup of the Realme 2 (Review), however the primary sensor has been improved and the lens now has a f/1.8 aperture. The second sensor is only used for depth calculation when shooting in Portrait mode. The camera app has also undergone a slight overhaul in the new version of ColourOS. Realme is introducing two new shooting modes for the rear camera, called Nightscape and Chroma Boost. According to Realme, Nightscape uses AI and multi-frame exposures to give you a brighter image in low-light. In practice, this actually delivered good results in most scenarios but it wasn't very effective in extreme low-light situations. The shutter is kept open for a bit longer than the usual 1/10 or 1/15 of a second (the maximum time we recorded was 1/8 of a second) in low light, and at a lower ISO value. Shot on Realme 3 using Auto mode (Tap for full-sized image)   Shot on Realme 3 using Nightscape mode (Tap for full-sized image)   There's also a bit of sharpening applied. You'll need to keep your hand steady for a couple of seconds when taking shots, but the end result is a big improvement compared to shooting in Auto mode, as details are sharper and shadows are lifted, revealing more detail. The second new addition is Chroma Boost, which can be toggled from within the viewfinder. This is said to boost the dynamic range of an image, especially when shooting a subject against bright light. Colours and brightness did get a nice boost in our test shots. The results didn't always look natural, but the effect was definitely striking. Shot on Realme 3 without Chroma Boost (Tap for full-sized image)   Shot on Realme 3 with Chroma Boost on (Tap for full-sized image)   The quality of photos taken with the primary camera was a bit of a hit or miss when shooting landscapes. Some shots had very good detail, but the Realme 3 struggled with complex textures such as foliage. Macros were sharp and well detailed, with good colours under good light, but again, we had instances when the phone refused to focus correctly on an intended subject, despite us tapping the viewfinder. HDR is present but colours can look a bit oversaturated. In low light, the camera produced soft and mushy shots, unless we used Nightscape mode, but this only works well if you and your subject stay still. There's a Portrait mode for both the front and back cameras. Edge detection was handled fairly well for objects with simple geometric shapes and for people, when using the rear camera. However, there were times when it went terribly wrong. The background blur is a little aggressive, and sadly, there's no way to adjust this before or after you've taken the shot. Edge detection in portrait mode with the front camera wasn't very good either.   Tap for full-sized images of Realme 3 camera samples   The front 13-megapixel sensor has an f/2.0 aperture. It captured detailed selfies under good light but struggled under low light. There's AI beautification which lets you do things such as smoothen your skin, slim your cheekbones, etc. You can let the AI do this automatically or adjust the individual sliders yourself. The Realme 3 can shoot video at up to 1080p at 30fps. Video quality was good when shot under good light, but there's no stabilisation, so footage is shaky if you move about too much. There's also a slow-motion video mode that captures 720p video at 90fps. The Realme 3 packs in a 4230mAh battery, which lasted for an entire day on average with our usage, which typically involved an hour of gaming, streaming music over Bluetooth, using social and productivity apps, and taking a few calls in between. Somehow, the Realme 3 didn't fare too well in our video loop test as it only lasted for 9 hours and 52 minutes, which is below average. There's no fast charging but the 10W charger can top up the battery to about 49 percent in an hour. VerdictThe Realme 3 is a fairly good all-round upgrade to the Realme 2 (Review). It has a more modern design, the rear camera gets some interesting new tricks, and the display is bright and vivid. Even though the battery didn't fare too well in our internal test, real-world battery usage was still good. The biggest improvement to this phone is its processor, which gets a much-needed boost. The cameras, even though improved slightly, can still do a lot better. We also would have liked other conveniences such as a Type-C charging port, a metal or glass enclosure, and a higher resolution display. The Realme 3's most obvious competitor is the recently launched Redmi Note 7 from Xiaomi. While we're yet to put that phone through the same tests to see how its cameras, battery, and CPU compare to those of the Realme 3, Xiaomi has a strong reputation for delivering features and performance that are tough to match. For starters, the Redmi Note 7 has a glass back, a full-HD+ display, USB Type-C port, and Qualcomm Quick Charge 4 support at roughly the same price. Those features would seem to put it ahead of the Realme 3, but we'll have a definitive answer after we test both phones. If you're on an absolute tight budget with no wiggle room, then the 3GB version of the Realme 3 is worth considering. However, do remember that for a Rs. 1,000 more, you can get the Redmi Note 7. The higher-end version of the Realme 3 overlaps with the 3GB version of the Realme U1. Realme has told Gadgets 360 that there won't be any change in availability of the other Realme models, at least for next few months, but we'd recommend the Realme U1 (Review) which has the same processor but better specs such as a full-HD display, if you're choosing between these two models. Are the affordable Realme 3 and Samsung Galaxy M30 smartphones worth buying?

Some shots had very good detail, but the Realme 3 struggled with complex textures such as foliage. Macros were sharp and well detailed, with good colours under good light, but again, we had instances when the phone refused to focus correctly on an intended subject, despite us tapping the viewfinder. HDR is present but colours can look a bit oversaturated. In low light, the camera produced soft and mushy shots, unless we used Nightscape mode, but this only works well if you and your subject stay still. There's a Portrait mode for both the front and back cameras. Edge detection was handled fairly well for objects with simple geometric shapes and for people, when using the rear camera. However, there were times when it went terribly wrong. The background blur is a little aggressive, and sadly, there's no way to adjust this before or after you've taken the shot. Edge detection in portrait mode with the front camera wasn't very good either.   Tap for full-sized images of Realme 3 camera samples   The front 13-megapixel sensor has an f/2.0 aperture. It captured detailed selfies under good light but struggled under low light. There's AI beautification which lets you do things such as smoothen your skin, slim your cheekbones, etc. You can let the AI do this automatically or adjust the individual sliders yourself. The Realme 3 can shoot video at up to 1080p at 30fps. Video quality was good when shot under good light, but there's no stabilisation, so footage is shaky if you move about too much. There's also a slow-motion video mode that captures 720p video at 90fps. The Realme 3 packs in a 4230mAh battery, which lasted for an entire day on average with our usage, which typically involved an hour of gaming, streaming music over Bluetooth, using social and productivity apps, and taking a few calls in between. Somehow, the Realme 3 didn't fare too well in our video loop test as it only lasted for 9 hours and 52 minutes, which is below average. There's no fast charging but the 10W charger can top up the battery to about 49 percent in an hour. VerdictThe Realme 3 is a fairly good all-round upgrade to the Realme 2 (Review). It has a more modern design, the rear camera gets some interesting new tricks, and the display is bright and vivid. Even though the battery didn't fare too well in our internal test, real-world battery usage was still good. The biggest improvement to this phone is its processor, which gets a much-needed boost. The cameras, even though improved slightly, can still do a lot better. We also would have liked other conveniences such as a Type-C charging port, a metal or glass enclosure, and a higher resolution display. The Realme 3's most obvious competitor is the recently launched Redmi Note 7 from Xiaomi. While we're yet to put that phone through the same tests to see how its cameras, battery, and CPU compare to those of the Realme 3, Xiaomi has a strong reputation for delivering features and performance that are tough to match. For starters, the Redmi Note 7 has a glass back, a full-HD+ display, USB Type-C port, and Qualcomm Quick Charge 4 support at roughly the same price. Those features would seem to put it ahead of the Realme 3, but we'll have a definitive answer after we test both phones. If you're on an absolute tight budget with no wiggle room, then the 3GB version of the Realme 3 is worth considering. However, do remember that for a Rs. 1,000 more, you can get the Redmi Note 7. The higher-end version of the Realme 3 overlaps with the 3GB version of the Realme U1. Realme has told Gadgets 360 that there won't be any change in availability of the other Realme models, at least for next few months, but we'd recommend the Realme U1 (Review) which has the same processor but better specs such as a full-HD display, if you're choosing between these two models.

2358,21,realme-c1-review-1936724,7,10,2018-10-25,1936724,Roydon Cerejo,Realme C1 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/realme-c1-review-1936724," Realme is on a mission to disrupt Xiaomi's dominance in the budget segment. The recent Realme 2 Pro (Review) smartphone offered very good all-round performance and good value at Rs. 17,990, and now with the Realme C1, the company hopes to raise the bar in the entry-level segment too. The Realme C1 competes with the Xiaomi Redmi 6A (Review), the Honor 7S (Review), and the recently announced Asus ZenFone Lite L1, at its introductory price of Rs. 5,999. The big appeal of the C1 is its relatively powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 SoC, big display, and battery, the latter of which is impressive for this price bracket. Keep in mind that this is just an introductory price, which means after a couple of flash sales, it could go up. If you do manage to grab one during the introductory offer period, should you go ahead and buy the Realme C1? Let's find out.    The plastic body of the Realme C1 makes it light and easy to carry around and the sides are thick enough to offer a comfortable grip without making the phone look fat. The matte finish of the frame doesn't pick up fingerprints but the laminated back and display do. Just like the Realme 2 Pro, the back panel of the C1 picks up scuffs quite easily if you're not careful. The display uses Corning Gorilla Glass, which should offer a good degree of protection, and an adhesive screen guard is included in the box as well. The Realme C1 has a massive 6.2-inch HD+ display, which produces pleasing, saturated colours. The display also gets quite bright, which makes it legible under sunlight. This is one of the few phones in its price range to have a notch. The display cutout isn't very deep or wide, which is probably why there's no option to hide it. Most apps scale all the way, filling up the area around the notch too. You can prevent this for individual apps, such as games, from the Settings app. The back of the Realme C1 has a laminated coating, which is prone to scratches   The power and volume buttons are placed on opposite sides of the phone and are easy to reach. The feedback from is good without being noisy. There's a single SIM tray on the side, which can accommodate two Nano-SIM cards and a microSD card (up to 256GB). The Micro-USB port, speaker grille, and 3.5mm headphone socket are on the bottom. At the back, we only have the dual camera setup on the top, a single LED flash module beside it, and the Realme logo at the bottom. The Realme C1 doesn't have a fingerprint sensor but you do get face unlock. It works fairly well under good light and you can make it more secure by forcing it to make sure your eyes are open. In low light, the display lights up to help capture your face. It takes a little longer, but it works. The Realme C1 ships with a silicone case, a SIM eject tool, instruction manuals, a 5W adapter, a screen protector, and a Micro-USB data cable. The Realme C1 is powered by Qualcomm's current top-end 400 series SoC - the Snapdragon 450 mobile platform. It consists of eight custom Kryo 260 CPU cores running at speeds of up to 1.8GHz, along with an Adreno 509 GPU. In benchmarks, we saw good performance in tests overall compared to similar smartphones in this price segment with SoCs such as the Snapdragon 430 or even the MediaTek Helio A22, used in the Redmi 6A. The Realme C1 is only available with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage. The internal storage runs out pretty quickly, as we soon found out, as you only get about 8.67GB of usable space. The C1 doesn't have any option for merging a microSD into the the internal storage, so you'll have to move stuff manually. There's a step-by-step guide under the storage sub-menu for transferring photos, videos, audio, documents, and even APKs, over to the microSD card. However most of the apps we had installed such as Facebook, Instagram, or even games, couldn't be moved over. You can change the default storage path for photos and videos taken with the camera, but there doesn't seem to be an option for apps. A few heavy games like PUBG can eat into your storage very quickly.   Internal storage on the Realme C1 runs our pretty quickly if you have big games installed   Other Realme C1 specifications include Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, dual 4G with VoLTE, a compass, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, accelerometer, USB-OTG support, and FM radio. The Realme C1 runs on ColourOS 5.1, which is based on Android 8.1 Oreo. Our unit wasn't quite up to date with security, as it was still running the August 2018 patch. The custom UI offers plenty of gestures and shortcuts, which we've seen before on Realme and Oppo smartphones. Game Space lets you automatically enable Do-Not-Disturb and disable auto brightness when gaming. Other features include the ability to blacklist unwanted callers and have notifications from apps like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger ‘pop-up' over the current app being used. However, there's no app or setting to change the theme of the phone. The Realme C1 isn't the speediest phone around, which could have something to do with the amount of RAM it has. The system uses about 1GB, and about 500MB is used by apps running in the background, which leaves you with roughy 500MB of free RAM for multitasking and other things. Even waking the phone up takes a good second or two at times. However, once you're in an app, things aren't so bad. We didn't face any issues browsing the Internet using Chrome, and multitasking was still manageable. The phone runs fairly cool but it does get a bit warm when gaming. Heavy titles like PUBG run, but gameplay is a bit sluggish, even at the lowest graphics settings. The display's touch response also feels a bit iffy now and then when gaming, but it's not a big issue genrally. The Realme C1 has a Micro-USB port and headphone socket placed at the bottom   The stock audio and video player handles most popular media codecs well. During video playback, you can access ‘pop-up' apps like WhatsApp and the SMS app as an overlay, which is convenient. The single speaker gets is quite loud but the audio quality isn't very good. The Realme C1 has a 13-megapixel main camera with a 2-megapixel depth sensor. The latter is used for gauging depth when shooting in portrait mode. Edge detection is decent, but the final image lacks good colours. With regular shots in daylight, the C1 captures a decent amount of detail in distant objects but we also noticed some chromatic aberration. Auto HDR is present but the end result isn't always very good looking. We have the common panorama and time-lapse shooting modes, as well as a stickers mode, which is fun to play around with. Noise is handled well in low light but details and focusing speeds take a hit. Under sufficient artificial lighting, we did end up with some very usable macros, but landscapes in general look soft. The front 5-megapixel sensor captures good colours in selfies when lighting is favourable, but at night, we encountered a lot of chroma noise in our images. Video recording tops out at 1080p but the output isn't very sharp, and there's no electronic stabilisation. Tap to see full-sized Realme C1 camera samples   Battery life is the Realme C1's biggest strength. The non-removable 4,230mAh battery easily lasted us about a day and half, and more at times when our usage was limited. In our battery drain test, we managed to run a 720p video file on loop for a total of 20 hours and 23 minutes. The Realme C1 doesn't support fast charging, but with a 10W adapter, we were able to fully charge it in about two and half to three hours. With the bundled 5W adapter, the phone takes nearly four and half hours to fully charge. VerdictAt Rs.6,999, the Realme C1 offers plenty of value. It would be hard to find another smartphone that matches the performance and features it delivers. Keep in mind that this pricing is for the festive season only, so there is a chance of it increasing by Rs. 1,000 or more, later on. The Realme C1 has a lot going for it such as excellent battery life, a relatively powerful SoC, a big display, and stylish looks. The 2GB of RAM does limit its multitasking ability a bit, and we would have liked an option with more internal storage. Overall, the Realme C1 won't disappoint you, especially at this price, provided you're lucky enough to be able to snag one during the festive sales.

2426,21,realme-u1-review-1954595,8,10,2018-11-28,1954595,Roydon Cerejo,Realme U1 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/realme-u1-review-1954595," The mainstream smartphone market might seem saturated with Xiaomi and Honor usually dominating this space, but up-and-coming-brands such as Realme have proven that there is still room to grow. A recent report has pegged the company as one of the top emerging bands in India, thanks to aggressive pricing and a rapidly expanding portfolio. Realme is adding another series to its portfolio, and the first model to debut is the Realme U1 — the company's first ‘Selfie Pro' smartphone. Given how popular Oppo's F series has been, it's no surprise that the once sub-brand of Oppo is adopting a similar strategy. Other than having a high-resolution front camera, the Realme U1 is also the first phone to debut MediaTek's Helio P70 SoC, which is said to be more powerful and efficient than its predecessor, the Helio P60. The Realme U1 will compete with Xiaomi's Redmi Y series, which is another line of selfie-focused smartphones, and of course other notables such as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review) and Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro (Review) in the sub-Rs. 15,000 price band. Let's see if it's worth recommending over such strong competitors.    The Realme U1 looks very similar to the recently launched Realme 2 Pro (Review), and that's not a bad thing. The rounded edges offer good grip, and the matte finish of the rear means it's not slippery. The display is raised a bit from the rest of the body, so its edges don't seamlessly blend with the sides of the body. The same goes for the laminated rear panel. Thankfully, the back of this phone didn't pick up any scuff marks during the course of our review, which is a good sign. At 8mm thick, the Realme U1 is comfortable to hold and isn't too heavy at 168g either. Button placement is good, and with typical use, we were able to reach the power and volume buttons without trouble. The SIM tray on the left can accommodate two Nano-SIMs and a microSD card, so you need not sacrifice one for the other. At the bottom of the Realme U1 we have a speaker grille, a Micro-USB port, and a 3.5mm headphone socket. Once again, the lack of USB Type-C is a bit disappointing. Our main issue is with the placement of the speaker grille, because it can easily be blocked the moment you hold the phone horizontally. This means that audio sounds muffled when playing games and watching videos, if you're not careful. The laminated back of the Realme U1 doesn't scuff too easily but it does attract a tonne of smudges   The 6.3-inch display on the Realme U1 has a 450nit maximum brightness, which makes it very legible under direct sunlight. It's an IPS panel with a 1080x2340-pixel resolution, which means you get sharp images and vivid colours. You also get a basic colour temperature adjustment slider in the Settings app. Realme has used Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for the front of this phone, which is a somewhat old generation, but it's better than nothing. The phone is also comes with a screen guard pre-applied, and ours picked up dings and scratches quite easily. The screen guard is a massive fingerprint magnet and so is the laminated back, so keeping the Realme U1 looking spotless can be a real chore. The waterdrop or dewdrop notch looks pretty, and is a minimal hindrance in full-screen apps. Still, if you find it getting in the way, you can flip a switch in the Settings to mask it for individual apps. There's a single camera in the notch, as the earpiece and a group of sensors are above it. Due to the limited space, there's no notification LED. The laminated back has a nice visual effect when light bounces off it. We have an ‘Ambitious Black' unit for review, but you can also get the Realme U1 in ‘Brave Blue' and ‘Fiery Gold'. The dual camera module on the rear doesn't bulge out too much, and the chrome trim held up well during our review period. The fingerprint sensor works well and is quick at authentication. It also has a slightly different texture than the rest of the back, making it easy to find. Face unlock is still very quick and inflow-light, the display lights up to compensate for the lack of good light. The speaker grille on the Realme U1 gets easily blocked when you hold the phone horizontally   The Realme U1 ships with a 10W power adapter, USB charging cable, silicone case, SIM eject tool, and the usual warranty and quick-start guides. The quality of the accessories is good, and Realme's packaging seems to have improved too, compared to its earlier offerings. One of the main highlights of the Realme U1 is the new MediaTek Helio P70 SoC, which is a speedier version of the Helio P60. According to Realme, this new chip should provide up to 13 percent better performance compared to its predecessor. It also has an improved version of MediaTek's on-chip AI processing engine, which is said to be more efficient. In benchmarks, the Realme U1 posted pretty good scores. It managed 1,44,161 points in AnTuTu, and in Geekbench, we got 1,573 and 5,828 in the single- and multi-threaded tests respectively. These numbers are better than what we've seen from most Helio P60-based phones we've tested such as the Oppo F7 (Review) and Oppo F9 (Review), and even edge out some Snapdragon 660-based phones too, such as the Realme 2 Pro. The integrated GPU gave us an average framerate of 35fps in the T-Rex graphics test of GFXbench. This is a bit lower than the Realme 2 Pro's score of 39fps in the same test. Our review unit had 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, but you can also opt for a variant with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Other features include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, USB-OTG, FM radio, GPS, and GLONASS. Dual 4G with dual VoLTE is supported. This phone's sensors include a proximity sensor, gyroscope, compass, ambient light sensor, and accelerometer. The ORoaming (first from left) and Smart Scan apps in action   The Realme U1 still uses ColorOS 5.2 which is based on Android 8.1 Oreo, just like the Realme 2 Pro. It also has the fairly recent October 2018 security patch, and according to the company, we should expect an update to Android Pie “early next year.” ColorOS on this phone does have some new tweaks and features. Realme has finally fixed the annoying two-step process needed for dismissing notifications, and you can now do it with a single right-swipe. You get the Realme U1 with a bunch of preloaded apps, most of which can be uninstalled if not needed. There are gestures for navigation, taking screenshots, and enabling split-screen mode. Smart Scan and ORoaming are two interesting features that we've seen before on Chinese versions of Oppo phones, and are now supported in India. Smart Scan now supports Hindi in addition to German, Italian, Spanish, French, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese. Using this app, you can scan a document with text written in Hindi and have it converted into editable Hindi text. In our experience, it worked quite well, and you don't need an active Internet connection. However, you do need Internet access to use the ‘Scan and translate' feature which translates small snippets of text between Hindi and English in real-time as you hover the camera over it. The ‘Shoot and translate' feature lets you take photos of entire pages and convert them into editable text. ORoaming generates a virtual SIM card on your phone so you can use local data services (not voice or SMS) in countries you're travelling to without having to switch SIM cards or use international roaming. Prices range between $11 and $21 for a week, depending on the country. ORoaming covers most major countries and regions, but the choice of available data packages seems a bit limited. The largest package for most countries tops out at 1GB for a week, with some exceptions such as Australia and Hong Kong, that go up to 4GB. This service is available because of a partnership between Realme and Redtea Mobile, an eSIM solutions provider. We couldn't actually test ORoaming to see how well it works or not since it would require physically travelling to one of the supported countries. The Realme U1 didn't give us any unpleasant surprises during day-to-day usage and it performed just as we expected it to. Cleaning up fingerprint smudges is an uphill battle on this phone, so if you're the finicky type then we suggest using the bundled case. The display is lively, and viewing angles are pretty good too. We didn't have any issues with call quality either, and the phone runs cool for the most part. The Realme U1 supports two Nano SIMs with dual 4G VoLTE and a dedicated slot for a microSD card   The Helio P70 easily chomped though most games and managed to deliver solid framerates. Asphalt 9: Legends didn't seem to faze it one bit, even on the ‘High' graphics preset. PUBG Mobile also ran smoothly, but at the ‘Medium' setting. The slim borders of the display and the tiny notch give you better immersion in your content, which is nice. The phone does get slightly warm when gaming or with heavy camera use, which is normal. Most popular audio and video file formats play just fine. The stock music player supports sound enhancements by Dirac Research, which can be enabled if you use wired headphones. The speaker gets fairly loud too, but we would have swapped its place with the headphone socket, as it's easily blocked when the phone is held in landscape mode. Since this is a selfie-focused phone, let's start with the front camera. It's a 25-megapixel Sony IMX 576 sensor with an f/2 aperture, which we've previously seen in the Oppo F7. In daylight, the Realme U1 captures detailed selfies, with good skin tones and colours in general. The AI beauty mode isn't too aggressive, and does a good job in smoothening your skin most of the time. You might like the Super Vivid mode if you're into highly saturated colours. You can enable the depth effect, which does a decent job of blurring the background. In the latter mode, the camera uses a four-in-one pixel binning technique to give you better detail by trading off the resolution, so you get a 8-megapixel shot. When shooting against bright light, you get a real-time preview of what the HDR version of your image would look like. Tap for full-sized images of Realme U1 camera samples    In low light, we found the camera struggling to capture clean and detailed shots. Surprisingly, it still shoots at the full 25-megapixel resolution rather than defaulting to the pixel binning technique. As a result, selfies look grainy and HDR isn't of much help, as bright lights in the background looked burnt out. Edge detection isn't too accurate under dim lighting in depth mode. Realme has stated that an update to improve the front camera bokeh' mode will be released by the time this phone goes on sale. The primary13-megapixel sensor on the rear has a f/2.2 aperture. It does a fairly good job with detail under natural light, but struggles in low light. Autofocus is not the quickest, as this camera has to hunt for about a second before locking focus. The Super Vivid mode is handy in some situations, especially when you want a little more ‘pop' in the colours. HDR works satisfactorily too, and you get the standard shooting modes such as anorama, Timelapse, Professional, and Portrait. The latter works decently well on objects too, thanks to the dedicated 2-megapixel depth sensor. Shot using Super Vivid mode on the Realme U1   Tap for full sized images of Realme U1 camera samples   Video recording tops out at 1080p and there's no electronic stabilisation to smoothen out hand shakes. The quality is decent, but since the autofocus isn't very quick, we noticed a bit of hunting as we moved about. The framerate is fairly solid though, and low-light footage isn't too noisy. Despite the powerful SoC, the rear camera doesn't shoot 4K video, which is a shame since many phones in this segment can do that. According to Realme, this resolution has been left out since the sensor doesn't support it. The 3500mAh battery easily lasts a full day on a single charge. We also got a good runtime in our HD video loop test, where the U1 ran an HD video non-stop for 14 hours and 56 minutes. There's no fast charging, but the included 10W adapter helps speed up the charging process a bit. VerdictThe Realme U1 starts at a price of Rs. 11,999 for the variant with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. That's not bad, considering it has a pretty powerful SoC and delivers very good battery life — a winning combo that not many in this segment have pulled off. It's roughly the same price as the 4GB version of the Xiaomi Redmi Y2 (Review), but considering that the front cameras of both phones have a tough time in low light, we think you're better off with the Realme U1, which has a more modern design and more powerful internals. The 4GB RAM version that we tested is priced at Rs. 14,499, which puts it smack against the base variant of Realme's own Realme 2 Pro (Review). The latter has a better rear camera and supports 4K video, so if that's your priority then we'd recommend it over the U1. At the time of publishing this review, none of the Realme 2 variants were in stock. The company has told us that the phone will continue be sold though flash sales every Friday, but it hasn't specified whether that means all variants will still be available. We just wish the Realme U1 had similar or better cameras than the Realme 2 Pro. At around this price, you also have phones like the Redmi Note 6 Pro (Review) and Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 (6GB) (Review), which offer good all-round performance. The Realme U1 misses out a few things like video stabilisation, and the low-light performance of its front as well as rear cameras is average at best. On the other hand, it does have many upsides such as a powerful processor, good battery life, a sharp display, and nice aesthetics. It also takes good pictures in daylight, which makes it worth recommending. Is Realme U1 essentially Redmi Note 6 Pro on steroids?

It managed 1,44,161 points in AnTuTu, and in Geekbench, we got 1,573 and 5,828 in the single- and multi-threaded tests respectively. These numbers are better than what we've seen from most Helio P60-based phones we've tested such as the Oppo F7 (Review) and Oppo F9 (Review), and even edge out some Snapdragon 660-based phones too, such as the Realme 2 Pro. The integrated GPU gave us an average framerate of 35fps in the T-Rex graphics test of GFXbench. This is a bit lower than the Realme 2 Pro's score of 39fps in the same test. Our review unit had 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, but you can also opt for a variant with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Other features include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, USB-OTG, FM radio, GPS, and GLONASS. Dual 4G with dual VoLTE is supported. This phone's sensors include a proximity sensor, gyroscope, compass, ambient light sensor, and accelerometer. The ORoaming (first from left) and Smart Scan apps in action   The Realme U1 still uses ColorOS 5.2 which is based on Android 8.1 Oreo, just like the Realme 2 Pro. It also has the fairly recent October 2018 security patch, and according to the company, we should expect an update to Android Pie “early next year.” ColorOS on this phone does have some new tweaks and features. Realme has finally fixed the annoying two-step process needed for dismissing notifications, and you can now do it with a single right-swipe. You get the Realme U1 with a bunch of preloaded apps, most of which can be uninstalled if not needed. There are gestures for navigation, taking screenshots, and enabling split-screen mode. Smart Scan and ORoaming are two interesting features that we've seen before on Chinese versions of Oppo phones, and are now supported in India. Smart Scan now supports Hindi in addition to German, Italian, Spanish, French, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese. Using this app, you can scan a document with text written in Hindi and have it converted into editable Hindi text. In our experience, it worked quite well, and you don't need an active Internet connection. However, you do need Internet access to use the ‘Scan and translate' feature which translates small snippets of text between Hindi and English in real-time as you hover the camera over it. The ‘Shoot and translate' feature lets you take photos of entire pages and convert them into editable text. ORoaming generates a virtual SIM card on your phone so you can use local data services (not voice or SMS) in countries you're travelling to without having to switch SIM cards or use international roaming. Prices range between $11 and $21 for a week, depending on the country. ORoaming covers most major countries and regions, but the choice of available data packages seems a bit limited. The largest package for most countries tops out at 1GB for a week, with some exceptions such as Australia and Hong Kong, that go up to 4GB. This service is available because of a partnership between Realme and Redtea Mobile, an eSIM solutions provider. We couldn't actually test ORoaming to see how well it works or not since it would require physically travelling to one of the supported countries. The Realme U1 didn't give us any unpleasant surprises during day-to-day usage and it performed just as we expected it to. Cleaning up fingerprint smudges is an uphill battle on this phone, so if you're the finicky type then we suggest using the bundled case. The display is lively, and viewing angles are pretty good too. We didn't have any issues with call quality either, and the phone runs cool for the most part. The Realme U1 supports two Nano SIMs with dual 4G VoLTE and a dedicated slot for a microSD card   The Helio P70 easily chomped though most games and managed to deliver solid framerates. Asphalt 9: Legends didn't seem to faze it one bit, even on the ‘High' graphics preset. PUBG Mobile also ran smoothly, but at the ‘Medium' setting. The slim borders of the display and the tiny notch give you better immersion in your content, which is nice. The phone does get slightly warm when gaming or with heavy camera use, which is normal. Most popular audio and video file formats play just fine. The stock music player supports sound enhancements by Dirac Research, which can be enabled if you use wired headphones. The speaker gets fairly loud too, but we would have swapped its place with the headphone socket, as it's easily blocked when the phone is held in landscape mode. Since this is a selfie-focused phone, let's start with the front camera. It's a 25-megapixel Sony IMX 576 sensor with an f/2 aperture, which we've previously seen in the Oppo F7. In daylight, the Realme U1 captures detailed selfies, with good skin tones and colours in general. The AI beauty mode isn't too aggressive, and does a good job in smoothening your skin most of the time. You might like the Super Vivid mode if you're into highly saturated colours. You can enable the depth effect, which does a decent job of blurring the background. In the latter mode, the camera uses a four-in-one pixel binning technique to give you better detail by trading off the resolution, so you get a 8-megapixel shot. When shooting against bright light, you get a real-time preview of what the HDR version of your image would look like. Tap for full-sized images of Realme U1 camera samples    In low light, we found the camera struggling to capture clean and detailed shots. Surprisingly, it still shoots at the full 25-megapixel resolution rather than defaulting to the pixel binning technique. As a result, selfies look grainy and HDR isn't of much help, as bright lights in the background looked burnt out. Edge detection isn't too accurate under dim lighting in depth mode. Realme has stated that an update to improve the front camera bokeh' mode will be released by the time this phone goes on sale. The primary13-megapixel sensor on the rear has a f/2.2 aperture. It does a fairly good job with detail under natural light, but struggles in low light. Autofocus is not the quickest, as this camera has to hunt for about a second before locking focus. The Super Vivid mode is handy in some situations, especially when you want a little more ‘pop' in the colours. HDR works satisfactorily too, and you get the standard shooting modes such as anorama, Timelapse, Professional, and Portrait. The latter works decently well on objects too, thanks to the dedicated 2-megapixel depth sensor. Shot using Super Vivid mode on the Realme U1   Tap for full sized images of Realme U1 camera samples   Video recording tops out at 1080p and there's no electronic stabilisation to smoothen out hand shakes. The quality is decent, but since the autofocus isn't very quick, we noticed a bit of hunting as we moved about. The framerate is fairly solid though, and low-light footage isn't too noisy. Despite the powerful SoC, the rear camera doesn't shoot 4K video, which is a shame since many phones in this segment can do that. According to Realme, this resolution has been left out since the sensor doesn't support it. The 3500mAh battery easily lasts a full day on a single charge. We also got a good runtime in our HD video loop test, where the U1 ran an HD video non-stop for 14 hours and 56 minutes. There's no fast charging, but the included 10W adapter helps speed up the charging process a bit. VerdictThe Realme U1 starts at a price of Rs. 11,999 for the variant with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. That's not bad, considering it has a pretty powerful SoC and delivers very good battery life — a winning combo that not many in this segment have pulled off. It's roughly the same price as the 4GB version of the Xiaomi Redmi Y2 (Review), but considering that the front cameras of both phones have a tough time in low light, we think you're better off with the Realme U1, which has a more modern design and more powerful internals. The 4GB RAM version that we tested is priced at Rs. 14,499, which puts it smack against the base variant of Realme's own Realme 2 Pro (Review). The latter has a better rear camera and supports 4K video, so if that's your priority then we'd recommend it over the U1. At the time of publishing this review, none of the Realme 2 variants were in stock. The company has told us that the phone will continue be sold though flash sales every Friday, but it hasn't specified whether that means all variants will still be available. We just wish the Realme U1 had similar or better cameras than the Realme 2 Pro. At around this price, you also have phones like the Redmi Note 6 Pro (Review) and Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 (6GB) (Review), which offer good all-round performance. The Realme U1 misses out a few things like video stabilisation, and the low-light performance of its front as well as rear cameras is average at best. On the other hand, it does have many upsides such as a powerful processor, good battery life, a sharp display, and nice aesthetics. It also takes good pictures in daylight, which makes it worth recommending. Is Realme U1 essentially Redmi Note 6 Pro on steroids?

2426,21,realme-u1-review-1954595,8,10,2018-11-28,1954595,Roydon Cerejo,Realme U1 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/realme-u1-review-1954595," The mainstream smartphone market might seem saturated with Xiaomi and Honor usually dominating this space, but up-and-coming-brands such as Realme have proven that there is still room to grow. A recent report has pegged the company as one of the top emerging bands in India, thanks to aggressive pricing and a rapidly expanding portfolio. Realme is adding another series to its portfolio, and the first model to debut is the Realme U1 — the company's first ‘Selfie Pro' smartphone. Given how popular Oppo's F series has been, it's no surprise that the once sub-brand of Oppo is adopting a similar strategy. Other than having a high-resolution front camera, the Realme U1 is also the first phone to debut MediaTek's Helio P70 SoC, which is said to be more powerful and efficient than its predecessor, the Helio P60. The Realme U1 will compete with Xiaomi's Redmi Y series, which is another line of selfie-focused smartphones, and of course other notables such as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review) and Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro (Review) in the sub-Rs. 15,000 price band. Let's see if it's worth recommending over such strong competitors.    The Realme U1 looks very similar to the recently launched Realme 2 Pro (Review), and that's not a bad thing. The rounded edges offer good grip, and the matte finish of the rear means it's not slippery. The display is raised a bit from the rest of the body, so its edges don't seamlessly blend with the sides of the body. The same goes for the laminated rear panel. Thankfully, the back of this phone didn't pick up any scuff marks during the course of our review, which is a good sign. At 8mm thick, the Realme U1 is comfortable to hold and isn't too heavy at 168g either. Button placement is good, and with typical use, we were able to reach the power and volume buttons without trouble. The SIM tray on the left can accommodate two Nano-SIMs and a microSD card, so you need not sacrifice one for the other. At the bottom of the Realme U1 we have a speaker grille, a Micro-USB port, and a 3.5mm headphone socket. Once again, the lack of USB Type-C is a bit disappointing. Our main issue is with the placement of the speaker grille, because it can easily be blocked the moment you hold the phone horizontally. This means that audio sounds muffled when playing games and watching videos, if you're not careful. The laminated back of the Realme U1 doesn't scuff too easily but it does attract a tonne of smudges   The 6.3-inch display on the Realme U1 has a 450nit maximum brightness, which makes it very legible under direct sunlight. It's an IPS panel with a 1080x2340-pixel resolution, which means you get sharp images and vivid colours. You also get a basic colour temperature adjustment slider in the Settings app. Realme has used Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for the front of this phone, which is a somewhat old generation, but it's better than nothing. The phone is also comes with a screen guard pre-applied, and ours picked up dings and scratches quite easily. The screen guard is a massive fingerprint magnet and so is the laminated back, so keeping the Realme U1 looking spotless can be a real chore. The waterdrop or dewdrop notch looks pretty, and is a minimal hindrance in full-screen apps. Still, if you find it getting in the way, you can flip a switch in the Settings to mask it for individual apps. There's a single camera in the notch, as the earpiece and a group of sensors are above it. Due to the limited space, there's no notification LED. The laminated back has a nice visual effect when light bounces off it. We have an ‘Ambitious Black' unit for review, but you can also get the Realme U1 in ‘Brave Blue' and ‘Fiery Gold'. The dual camera module on the rear doesn't bulge out too much, and the chrome trim held up well during our review period. The fingerprint sensor works well and is quick at authentication. It also has a slightly different texture than the rest of the back, making it easy to find. Face unlock is still very quick and inflow-light, the display lights up to compensate for the lack of good light. The speaker grille on the Realme U1 gets easily blocked when you hold the phone horizontally   The Realme U1 ships with a 10W power adapter, USB charging cable, silicone case, SIM eject tool, and the usual warranty and quick-start guides. The quality of the accessories is good, and Realme's packaging seems to have improved too, compared to its earlier offerings. One of the main highlights of the Realme U1 is the new MediaTek Helio P70 SoC, which is a speedier version of the Helio P60. According to Realme, this new chip should provide up to 13 percent better performance compared to its predecessor. It also has an improved version of MediaTek's on-chip AI processing engine, which is said to be more efficient. In benchmarks, the Realme U1 posted pretty good scores.

The slim borders of the display and the tiny notch give you better immersion in your content, which is nice. The phone does get slightly warm when gaming or with heavy camera use, which is normal. Most popular audio and video file formats play just fine. The stock music player supports sound enhancements by Dirac Research, which can be enabled if you use wired headphones. The speaker gets fairly loud too, but we would have swapped its place with the headphone socket, as it's easily blocked when the phone is held in landscape mode. Since this is a selfie-focused phone, let's start with the front camera. It's a 25-megapixel Sony IMX 576 sensor with an f/2 aperture, which we've previously seen in the Oppo F7. In daylight, the Realme U1 captures detailed selfies, with good skin tones and colours in general. The AI beauty mode isn't too aggressive, and does a good job in smoothening your skin most of the time. You might like the Super Vivid mode if you're into highly saturated colours. You can enable the depth effect, which does a decent job of blurring the background. In the latter mode, the camera uses a four-in-one pixel binning technique to give you better detail by trading off the resolution, so you get a 8-megapixel shot. When shooting against bright light, you get a real-time preview of what the HDR version of your image would look like. Tap for full-sized images of Realme U1 camera samples    In low light, we found the camera struggling to capture clean and detailed shots. Surprisingly, it still shoots at the full 25-megapixel resolution rather than defaulting to the pixel binning technique. As a result, selfies look grainy and HDR isn't of much help, as bright lights in the background looked burnt out. Edge detection isn't too accurate under dim lighting in depth mode. Realme has stated that an update to improve the front camera bokeh' mode will be released by the time this phone goes on sale. The primary13-megapixel sensor on the rear has a f/2.2 aperture. It does a fairly good job with detail under natural light, but struggles in low light. Autofocus is not the quickest, as this camera has to hunt for about a second before locking focus. The Super Vivid mode is handy in some situations, especially when you want a little more ‘pop' in the colours. HDR works satisfactorily too, and you get the standard shooting modes such as anorama, Timelapse, Professional, and Portrait. The latter works decently well on objects too, thanks to the dedicated 2-megapixel depth sensor. Shot using Super Vivid mode on the Realme U1   Tap for full sized images of Realme U1 camera samples   Video recording tops out at 1080p and there's no electronic stabilisation to smoothen out hand shakes. The quality is decent, but since the autofocus isn't very quick, we noticed a bit of hunting as we moved about. The framerate is fairly solid though, and low-light footage isn't too noisy. Despite the powerful SoC, the rear camera doesn't shoot 4K video, which is a shame since many phones in this segment can do that. According to Realme, this resolution has been left out since the sensor doesn't support it. The 3500mAh battery easily lasts a full day on a single charge. We also got a good runtime in our HD video loop test, where the U1 ran an HD video non-stop for 14 hours and 56 minutes. There's no fast charging, but the included 10W adapter helps speed up the charging process a bit. VerdictThe Realme U1 starts at a price of Rs. 11,999 for the variant with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. That's not bad, considering it has a pretty powerful SoC and delivers very good battery life — a winning combo that not many in this segment have pulled off. It's roughly the same price as the 4GB version of the Xiaomi Redmi Y2 (Review), but considering that the front cameras of both phones have a tough time in low light, we think you're better off with the Realme U1, which has a more modern design and more powerful internals. The 4GB RAM version that we tested is priced at Rs. 14,499, which puts it smack against the base variant of Realme's own Realme 2 Pro (Review). The latter has a better rear camera and supports 4K video, so if that's your priority then we'd recommend it over the U1. At the time of publishing this review, none of the Realme 2 variants were in stock. The company has told us that the phone will continue be sold though flash sales every Friday, but it hasn't specified whether that means all variants will still be available. We just wish the Realme U1 had similar or better cameras than the Realme 2 Pro. At around this price, you also have phones like the Redmi Note 6 Pro (Review) and Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 (6GB) (Review), which offer good all-round performance. The Realme U1 misses out a few things like video stabilisation, and the low-light performance of its front as well as rear cameras is average at best. On the other hand, it does have many upsides such as a powerful processor, good battery life, a sharp display, and nice aesthetics. It also takes good pictures in daylight, which makes it worth recommending. Is Realme U1 essentially Redmi Note 6 Pro on steroids?

2426,21,realme-u1-review-1954595,8,10,2018-11-28,1954595,Roydon Cerejo,Realme U1 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/realme-u1-review-1954595," The mainstream smartphone market might seem saturated with Xiaomi and Honor usually dominating this space, but up-and-coming-brands such as Realme have proven that there is still room to grow. A recent report has pegged the company as one of the top emerging bands in India, thanks to aggressive pricing and a rapidly expanding portfolio. Realme is adding another series to its portfolio, and the first model to debut is the Realme U1 — the company's first ‘Selfie Pro' smartphone. Given how popular Oppo's F series has been, it's no surprise that the once sub-brand of Oppo is adopting a similar strategy. Other than having a high-resolution front camera, the Realme U1 is also the first phone to debut MediaTek's Helio P70 SoC, which is said to be more powerful and efficient than its predecessor, the Helio P60. The Realme U1 will compete with Xiaomi's Redmi Y series, which is another line of selfie-focused smartphones, and of course other notables such as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review) and Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro (Review) in the sub-Rs. 15,000 price band. Let's see if it's worth recommending over such strong competitors.    The Realme U1 looks very similar to the recently launched Realme 2 Pro (Review), and that's not a bad thing. The rounded edges offer good grip, and the matte finish of the rear means it's not slippery. The display is raised a bit from the rest of the body, so its edges don't seamlessly blend with the sides of the body. The same goes for the laminated rear panel. Thankfully, the back of this phone didn't pick up any scuff marks during the course of our review, which is a good sign. At 8mm thick, the Realme U1 is comfortable to hold and isn't too heavy at 168g either. Button placement is good, and with typical use, we were able to reach the power and volume buttons without trouble. The SIM tray on the left can accommodate two Nano-SIMs and a microSD card, so you need not sacrifice one for the other. At the bottom of the Realme U1 we have a speaker grille, a Micro-USB port, and a 3.5mm headphone socket. Once again, the lack of USB Type-C is a bit disappointing. Our main issue is with the placement of the speaker grille, because it can easily be blocked the moment you hold the phone horizontally. This means that audio sounds muffled when playing games and watching videos, if you're not careful. The laminated back of the Realme U1 doesn't scuff too easily but it does attract a tonne of smudges   The 6.3-inch display on the Realme U1 has a 450nit maximum brightness, which makes it very legible under direct sunlight. It's an IPS panel with a 1080x2340-pixel resolution, which means you get sharp images and vivid colours. You also get a basic colour temperature adjustment slider in the Settings app. Realme has used Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for the front of this phone, which is a somewhat old generation, but it's better than nothing. The phone is also comes with a screen guard pre-applied, and ours picked up dings and scratches quite easily. The screen guard is a massive fingerprint magnet and so is the laminated back, so keeping the Realme U1 looking spotless can be a real chore. The waterdrop or dewdrop notch looks pretty, and is a minimal hindrance in full-screen apps. Still, if you find it getting in the way, you can flip a switch in the Settings to mask it for individual apps. There's a single camera in the notch, as the earpiece and a group of sensors are above it. Due to the limited space, there's no notification LED. The laminated back has a nice visual effect when light bounces off it. We have an ‘Ambitious Black' unit for review, but you can also get the Realme U1 in ‘Brave Blue' and ‘Fiery Gold'. The dual camera module on the rear doesn't bulge out too much, and the chrome trim held up well during our review period. The fingerprint sensor works well and is quick at authentication. It also has a slightly different texture than the rest of the back, making it easy to find. Face unlock is still very quick and inflow-light, the display lights up to compensate for the lack of good light. The speaker grille on the Realme U1 gets easily blocked when you hold the phone horizontally   The Realme U1 ships with a 10W power adapter, USB charging cable, silicone case, SIM eject tool, and the usual warranty and quick-start guides. The quality of the accessories is good, and Realme's packaging seems to have improved too, compared to its earlier offerings. One of the main highlights of the Realme U1 is the new MediaTek Helio P70 SoC, which is a speedier version of the Helio P60. According to Realme, this new chip should provide up to 13 percent better performance compared to its predecessor. It also has an improved version of MediaTek's on-chip AI processing engine, which is said to be more efficient. In benchmarks, the Realme U1 posted pretty good scores. It managed 1,44,161 points in AnTuTu, and in Geekbench, we got 1,573 and 5,828 in the single- and multi-threaded tests respectively. These numbers are better than what we've seen from most Helio P60-based phones we've tested such as the Oppo F7 (Review) and Oppo F9 (Review), and even edge out some Snapdragon 660-based phones too, such as the Realme 2 Pro. The integrated GPU gave us an average framerate of 35fps in the T-Rex graphics test of GFXbench. This is a bit lower than the Realme 2 Pro's score of 39fps in the same test. Our review unit had 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, but you can also opt for a variant with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Other features include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, USB-OTG, FM radio, GPS, and GLONASS. Dual 4G with dual VoLTE is supported. This phone's sensors include a proximity sensor, gyroscope, compass, ambient light sensor, and accelerometer. The ORoaming (first from left) and Smart Scan apps in action   The Realme U1 still uses ColorOS 5.2 which is based on Android 8.1 Oreo, just like the Realme 2 Pro. It also has the fairly recent October 2018 security patch, and according to the company, we should expect an update to Android Pie “early next year.” ColorOS on this phone does have some new tweaks and features. Realme has finally fixed the annoying two-step process needed for dismissing notifications, and you can now do it with a single right-swipe. You get the Realme U1 with a bunch of preloaded apps, most of which can be uninstalled if not needed. There are gestures for navigation, taking screenshots, and enabling split-screen mode. Smart Scan and ORoaming are two interesting features that we've seen before on Chinese versions of Oppo phones, and are now supported in India. Smart Scan now supports Hindi in addition to German, Italian, Spanish, French, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese. Using this app, you can scan a document with text written in Hindi and have it converted into editable Hindi text. In our experience, it worked quite well, and you don't need an active Internet connection. However, you do need Internet access to use the ‘Scan and translate' feature which translates small snippets of text between Hindi and English in real-time as you hover the camera over it. The ‘Shoot and translate' feature lets you take photos of entire pages and convert them into editable text. ORoaming generates a virtual SIM card on your phone so you can use local data services (not voice or SMS) in countries you're travelling to without having to switch SIM cards or use international roaming. Prices range between $11 and $21 for a week, depending on the country. ORoaming covers most major countries and regions, but the choice of available data packages seems a bit limited. The largest package for most countries tops out at 1GB for a week, with some exceptions such as Australia and Hong Kong, that go up to 4GB. This service is available because of a partnership between Realme and Redtea Mobile, an eSIM solutions provider. We couldn't actually test ORoaming to see how well it works or not since it would require physically travelling to one of the supported countries. The Realme U1 didn't give us any unpleasant surprises during day-to-day usage and it performed just as we expected it to. Cleaning up fingerprint smudges is an uphill battle on this phone, so if you're the finicky type then we suggest using the bundled case. The display is lively, and viewing angles are pretty good too. We didn't have any issues with call quality either, and the phone runs cool for the most part.

The 4GB RAM version that we tested is priced at Rs. 14,499, which puts it smack against the base variant of Realme's own Realme 2 Pro (Review). The latter has a better rear camera and supports 4K video, so if that's your priority then we'd recommend it over the U1. At the time of publishing this review, none of the Realme 2 variants were in stock. The company has told us that the phone will continue be sold though flash sales every Friday, but it hasn't specified whether that means all variants will still be available. We just wish the Realme U1 had similar or better cameras than the Realme 2 Pro. At around this price, you also have phones like the Redmi Note 6 Pro (Review) and Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 (6GB) (Review), which offer good all-round performance. The Realme U1 misses out a few things like video stabilisation, and the low-light performance of its front as well as rear cameras is average at best. On the other hand, it does have many upsides such as a powerful processor, good battery life, a sharp display, and nice aesthetics. It also takes good pictures in daylight, which makes it worth recommending. Is Realme U1 essentially Redmi Note 6 Pro on steroids?

2426,21,realme-u1-review-1954595,8,10,2018-11-28,1954595,Roydon Cerejo,Realme U1 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/realme-u1-review-1954595," The mainstream smartphone market might seem saturated with Xiaomi and Honor usually dominating this space, but up-and-coming-brands such as Realme have proven that there is still room to grow. A recent report has pegged the company as one of the top emerging bands in India, thanks to aggressive pricing and a rapidly expanding portfolio. Realme is adding another series to its portfolio, and the first model to debut is the Realme U1 — the company's first ‘Selfie Pro' smartphone. Given how popular Oppo's F series has been, it's no surprise that the once sub-brand of Oppo is adopting a similar strategy. Other than having a high-resolution front camera, the Realme U1 is also the first phone to debut MediaTek's Helio P70 SoC, which is said to be more powerful and efficient than its predecessor, the Helio P60. The Realme U1 will compete with Xiaomi's Redmi Y series, which is another line of selfie-focused smartphones, and of course other notables such as the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review) and Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro (Review) in the sub-Rs. 15,000 price band. Let's see if it's worth recommending over such strong competitors.    The Realme U1 looks very similar to the recently launched Realme 2 Pro (Review), and that's not a bad thing. The rounded edges offer good grip, and the matte finish of the rear means it's not slippery. The display is raised a bit from the rest of the body, so its edges don't seamlessly blend with the sides of the body. The same goes for the laminated rear panel. Thankfully, the back of this phone didn't pick up any scuff marks during the course of our review, which is a good sign. At 8mm thick, the Realme U1 is comfortable to hold and isn't too heavy at 168g either. Button placement is good, and with typical use, we were able to reach the power and volume buttons without trouble. The SIM tray on the left can accommodate two Nano-SIMs and a microSD card, so you need not sacrifice one for the other. At the bottom of the Realme U1 we have a speaker grille, a Micro-USB port, and a 3.5mm headphone socket. Once again, the lack of USB Type-C is a bit disappointing. Our main issue is with the placement of the speaker grille, because it can easily be blocked the moment you hold the phone horizontally. This means that audio sounds muffled when playing games and watching videos, if you're not careful. The laminated back of the Realme U1 doesn't scuff too easily but it does attract a tonne of smudges   The 6.3-inch display on the Realme U1 has a 450nit maximum brightness, which makes it very legible under direct sunlight. It's an IPS panel with a 1080x2340-pixel resolution, which means you get sharp images and vivid colours. You also get a basic colour temperature adjustment slider in the Settings app. Realme has used Corning Gorilla Glass 3 for the front of this phone, which is a somewhat old generation, but it's better than nothing. The phone is also comes with a screen guard pre-applied, and ours picked up dings and scratches quite easily. The screen guard is a massive fingerprint magnet and so is the laminated back, so keeping the Realme U1 looking spotless can be a real chore. The waterdrop or dewdrop notch looks pretty, and is a minimal hindrance in full-screen apps. Still, if you find it getting in the way, you can flip a switch in the Settings to mask it for individual apps. There's a single camera in the notch, as the earpiece and a group of sensors are above it. Due to the limited space, there's no notification LED. The laminated back has a nice visual effect when light bounces off it. We have an ‘Ambitious Black' unit for review, but you can also get the Realme U1 in ‘Brave Blue' and ‘Fiery Gold'. The dual camera module on the rear doesn't bulge out too much, and the chrome trim held up well during our review period. The fingerprint sensor works well and is quick at authentication. It also has a slightly different texture than the rest of the back, making it easy to find. Face unlock is still very quick and inflow-light, the display lights up to compensate for the lack of good light. The speaker grille on the Realme U1 gets easily blocked when you hold the phone horizontally   The Realme U1 ships with a 10W power adapter, USB charging cable, silicone case, SIM eject tool, and the usual warranty and quick-start guides. The quality of the accessories is good, and Realme's packaging seems to have improved too, compared to its earlier offerings. One of the main highlights of the Realme U1 is the new MediaTek Helio P70 SoC, which is a speedier version of the Helio P60. According to Realme, this new chip should provide up to 13 percent better performance compared to its predecessor. It also has an improved version of MediaTek's on-chip AI processing engine, which is said to be more efficient. In benchmarks, the Realme U1 posted pretty good scores. It managed 1,44,161 points in AnTuTu, and in Geekbench, we got 1,573 and 5,828 in the single- and multi-threaded tests respectively. These numbers are better than what we've seen from most Helio P60-based phones we've tested such as the Oppo F7 (Review) and Oppo F9 (Review), and even edge out some Snapdragon 660-based phones too, such as the Realme 2 Pro. The integrated GPU gave us an average framerate of 35fps in the T-Rex graphics test of GFXbench. This is a bit lower than the Realme 2 Pro's score of 39fps in the same test. Our review unit had 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, but you can also opt for a variant with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. Other features include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4.2, USB-OTG, FM radio, GPS, and GLONASS. Dual 4G with dual VoLTE is supported. This phone's sensors include a proximity sensor, gyroscope, compass, ambient light sensor, and accelerometer. The ORoaming (first from left) and Smart Scan apps in action   The Realme U1 still uses ColorOS 5.2 which is based on Android 8.1 Oreo, just like the Realme 2 Pro. It also has the fairly recent October 2018 security patch, and according to the company, we should expect an update to Android Pie “early next year.” ColorOS on this phone does have some new tweaks and features. Realme has finally fixed the annoying two-step process needed for dismissing notifications, and you can now do it with a single right-swipe. You get the Realme U1 with a bunch of preloaded apps, most of which can be uninstalled if not needed. There are gestures for navigation, taking screenshots, and enabling split-screen mode. Smart Scan and ORoaming are two interesting features that we've seen before on Chinese versions of Oppo phones, and are now supported in India. Smart Scan now supports Hindi in addition to German, Italian, Spanish, French, Korean, Japanese, and Chinese. Using this app, you can scan a document with text written in Hindi and have it converted into editable Hindi text. In our experience, it worked quite well, and you don't need an active Internet connection. However, you do need Internet access to use the ‘Scan and translate' feature which translates small snippets of text between Hindi and English in real-time as you hover the camera over it. The ‘Shoot and translate' feature lets you take photos of entire pages and convert them into editable text. ORoaming generates a virtual SIM card on your phone so you can use local data services (not voice or SMS) in countries you're travelling to without having to switch SIM cards or use international roaming. Prices range between $11 and $21 for a week, depending on the country. ORoaming covers most major countries and regions, but the choice of available data packages seems a bit limited. The largest package for most countries tops out at 1GB for a week, with some exceptions such as Australia and Hong Kong, that go up to 4GB. This service is available because of a partnership between Realme and Redtea Mobile, an eSIM solutions provider. We couldn't actually test ORoaming to see how well it works or not since it would require physically travelling to one of the supported countries. The Realme U1 didn't give us any unpleasant surprises during day-to-day usage and it performed just as we expected it to. Cleaning up fingerprint smudges is an uphill battle on this phone, so if you're the finicky type then we suggest using the bundled case. The display is lively, and viewing angles are pretty good too. We didn't have any issues with call quality either, and the phone runs cool for the most part. The Realme U1 supports two Nano SIMs with dual 4G VoLTE and a dedicated slot for a microSD card   The Helio P70 easily chomped though most games and managed to deliver solid framerates. Asphalt 9: Legends didn't seem to faze it one bit, even on the ‘High' graphics preset. PUBG Mobile also ran smoothly, but at the ‘Medium' setting. The slim borders of the display and the tiny notch give you better immersion in your content, which is nice. The phone does get slightly warm when gaming or with heavy camera use, which is normal. Most popular audio and video file formats play just fine. The stock music player supports sound enhancements by Dirac Research, which can be enabled if you use wired headphones. The speaker gets fairly loud too, but we would have swapped its place with the headphone socket, as it's easily blocked when the phone is held in landscape mode. Since this is a selfie-focused phone, let's start with the front camera. It's a 25-megapixel Sony IMX 576 sensor with an f/2 aperture, which we've previously seen in the Oppo F7. In daylight, the Realme U1 captures detailed selfies, with good skin tones and colours in general. The AI beauty mode isn't too aggressive, and does a good job in smoothening your skin most of the time. You might like the Super Vivid mode if you're into highly saturated colours. You can enable the depth effect, which does a decent job of blurring the background. In the latter mode, the camera uses a four-in-one pixel binning technique to give you better detail by trading off the resolution, so you get a 8-megapixel shot. When shooting against bright light, you get a real-time preview of what the HDR version of your image would look like. Tap for full-sized images of Realme U1 camera samples    In low light, we found the camera struggling to capture clean and detailed shots. Surprisingly, it still shoots at the full 25-megapixel resolution rather than defaulting to the pixel binning technique. As a result, selfies look grainy and HDR isn't of much help, as bright lights in the background looked burnt out. Edge detection isn't too accurate under dim lighting in depth mode. Realme has stated that an update to improve the front camera bokeh' mode will be released by the time this phone goes on sale. The primary13-megapixel sensor on the rear has a f/2.2 aperture. It does a fairly good job with detail under natural light, but struggles in low light. Autofocus is not the quickest, as this camera has to hunt for about a second before locking focus. The Super Vivid mode is handy in some situations, especially when you want a little more ‘pop' in the colours. HDR works satisfactorily too, and you get the standard shooting modes such as anorama, Timelapse, Professional, and Portrait. The latter works decently well on objects too, thanks to the dedicated 2-megapixel depth sensor. Shot using Super Vivid mode on the Realme U1   Tap for full sized images of Realme U1 camera samples   Video recording tops out at 1080p and there's no electronic stabilisation to smoothen out hand shakes. The quality is decent, but since the autofocus isn't very quick, we noticed a bit of hunting as we moved about. The framerate is fairly solid though, and low-light footage isn't too noisy. Despite the powerful SoC, the rear camera doesn't shoot 4K video, which is a shame since many phones in this segment can do that. According to Realme, this resolution has been left out since the sensor doesn't support it. The 3500mAh battery easily lasts a full day on a single charge. We also got a good runtime in our HD video loop test, where the U1 ran an HD video non-stop for 14 hours and 56 minutes. There's no fast charging, but the included 10W adapter helps speed up the charging process a bit. VerdictThe Realme U1 starts at a price of Rs. 11,999 for the variant with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. That's not bad, considering it has a pretty powerful SoC and delivers very good battery life — a winning combo that not many in this segment have pulled off.

2240,21,redmi-5-review-xiaomi-1828665,8,10,2018-03-26,1828665,Jamshed Avari,Redmi 5 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/redmi-5-review-xiaomi-1828665," Chinese giant Xiaomi offers a dizzying number of low-cost smartphones, each with multiple variants - at present, there are no fewer than sixteen different choices priced between Rs. 5,999 and Rs. 13,999 on its official website. There are multiple overlaps, so you can choose a smaller screen and lower-end processor if you want more RAM and storage, or vice versa. As you move up the price ladder, you have more and more choices, but this is still the budget end of the spectrum, and you have to decide which features and specifications are the most important to you. The new Redmi 5 slots in above the Redmi 5A (Review) and below the Redmi Note 5 (Review), but the lines are blurry because of these overlaps. This new phone covers all the basics and delivers a lot of in-demand features, in a slick, well-built package. Xiaomi has made a name for itself by upsetting the market time and again with solid products at low prices, and we're eager to see if it's managed to do so again. Here's our full review of the new Redmi 5, with everything you need to know.    The Redmi 5 looks a lot like the Redmi Note 5, which was launched in India just last month. That shouldn't be much of a surprise because that phone is known as the Redmi 5 Plus in some other countries. These two phones are much more visually aligned than the Redmi Note 5 and Note 5 Pro (Review), so we wonder why Xiaomi decided to group them this way. Predictably, there's a large 18:9 screen on the front. It's taller, but it isn't just filling space that used to be plastic, and we wouldn't call it bezel-free. There are still fairly prominent borders on the sides, and the forehead and chin are quite thick as well. Compared to its predecessor, the Redmi 5's body has been stretched vertically by just over 12mm, and it's also approximately 3mm wider, but 1mm slimmer. The review unit we received was black, with a matching black frame under the front glass, and a lot of people will choose this neutral option. The company is also offering this phone in the gold and rose gold options that we've seen hundreds of times by now, but there's a unique Lake Blue option which you can go for if you want to stand out. All three of those have white front faces.    Xiaomi claims to have used 2.5D curved-edge glass for the front, but the curve is barely visible. The sides, top, and bottom of the Redmi 5 are plastic and there's a metal plate across most of the back. The main camera is centred at the top of the rear, and sticks out by about 1mm. Below it is a single-LED flash (unlike the dual-LED one in exactly the same spot on the Redmi Note 5) and the fingerprint sensor which is easy enough to reach thanks to the overall size and proportions of the body. The power and volume buttons are on the right, and there's a hybrid dual-SIM tray on the left, so you'll have to choose between a second SIM and a microSD card. On the top, you'll find a 3.5mm headset socket, secondary mic, and Xiaomi's trademark infrared emitter for controlling appliances. We're somewhat surprised to see a Micro-USB port on the bottom rather than the newer Type-C. Another feature that's common with budget phones is that only one of the two symmetrical grilles on the bottom is actually a speaker. Build quality, and the overall fit and finish, are impressive for a phone at this price level. The only issue we had was that the ring around the rear camera is a bit too scratchy. Otherwise, this is a pretty comfortable phone to hold and use, and strikes a good balance between screen size and portability. Thankfully, smudges and fingerprints aren't a huge problem on the front or rear.    Our Xiaomi Redmi 5's retail box screams ""Redmi"", but the Xiaomi name is once again barely there, and relegated to one corner. Inside, you'll find a dark-tinted translucent flexible plastic case, a pretty bulky 2A charger, a Micro-USB cable, SIM eject tool, quick start guide, and warranty leaflet. Xiaomi doesn't bundled headsets with its phones, but it's happy to sell you one of the several models listed on its website. Compared to last year's Redmi 4 (Review), there are some substantial updates with this new model. First and foremost is the taller screen, which now measures 5.7 inches diagonally and is considerably larger than the 5-inch screen on the Redmi 4. The resolution is 720x1440, which is sharp enough for us. The processor gets a bump up to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 450, which is pretty powerful considering that we haven't seen it in any other sub-Rs. 10,000 phone before. You have three choices when it comes to storage and RAM - you can buy the Redmi 5 with either 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, or 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. All other specifications are the same across variants. We have the middle one in for review, and we suspect that this will be the most popular option. Potential buyers will be tempted by the minor price difference between the base variant and this one, but the top variant is a bit too expensive and overlaps with the Redmi Note 5. You could buy the Redmi Note 5 with 32GB of storage plus a 32GB microSD card for less than what the 64GB Redmi 5 costs. The battery capacity is about average for Android phones, at 3300mAh, and there's no support for fast charging. The rear camera has a 12-megapixel sensor with PDAF and an f/2.2 lens plus a single-LED flash, while the one in front has a 5-megapixel sensor and LED illuminator. The Redmi 5 supports Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, and 4G with VoLTE.    We're a little surprised and disappointed to see that Xiaomi is still using Android 7.1.2 for this phone. Xiaomi's custom skin is up to date, so we have MIUI 9.2.7, and it has a lot of fans because of how polished it is. Still, we would have liked some native Android features such as the ability to long-press an app icon to see contextual actions and notifications. Xiaomi says that bundled notifications and inline replies are supported in its notifications shade, but while this was true for SMS messages, Gmail wasn't supported. You can multitask with some apps running side-by-side on the screen, as long as they support it. The screen to the left of the first home screen is called App Vault, and it shows useful action shortcuts and widgets for certain apps. By default, there are widgets to show cricket scores and let you book Ola cabs, once you enter your personal information. Mi Drop is a simple Apple AirDrop clone that lets you send and receive files directly from other phones, but the app is now available to all Android users, making it potentially very useful. Mi Remote lets you control multiple household appliances via infrared, while Mi Home is for Xiaomi's own smart home products that have Wi-Fi built in. The Apps store is fairly straightforward and offers several popular apps and games. The Themes app has hundreds of downloadable themes as well as wallpapers, ringtones, fonts, and for some reason, also ""pop apps"" - which promise to be small apps that you can run without installation, but just redirected us to either the Xiaomi or Google Play stores when we tried them. Finally, Mi Community combines Xiaomi updates, a Q&A forum, a store for Xiaomi phones and accessories, and tutorials for MIUI. As we expected, performance was generally pleasant. We didn't have any trouble getting set up or using this phone for work or entertainment. A lot of apps work perfectly well on 18:9 screens already, and the rest are accommodated with blank space above and below their content which is masked well. MIUI is easy enough to get around, though you might have to search for some of the things you need in the Settings app.    All the regular apps and games we use to test with ran quite well, with no lag. Only the heaviest games stuttered a little when loading, but not during gameplay. We were also happy to note that the Redmi 5 didn't get very warm when doing anything intense. Throughout our time with this phone, we found the screen to be a bit dull, with colours that didn't really pop. Videos and games still looked fine, but we could tell that photos weren't looking their best on this screen. The single speaker can get extremely loud but the sound is harsh and will distort at higher volume levels. We were able to stretch a single charge through a full day of casual usage involving some gaming, video streaming, camera use and Web surfing, with a little bit left over the next morning. Our HD video loop battery test ran for 13 hours and 36 minutes, which is impressive. Fast charging would have been nice, but that might be asking for too much at these prices. Half an hour of charging only got us up to 32 percent, and a full hour gave us 62 percent. We got a score of 69,812 in AnTuTu 7, and Geekbench 4 gave us 759 and 3,490 points respectively in its single- and multi-threaded tests. Graphics performance wasn't bad at all, with scores of 32fps in the GFXBench T-Rex run and 7,931 in 3DMark's Ice Storm Extreme test.  Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi 5 camera samples   The cameras on the Redmi 5 are good, but not great, and this is where most budget phones stumble. Photos definitely look sharper on the phone's own screen than they do on a large monitor. When you check them out at full size, you'll see that details are lacking and textures aren't reproduced well. Shots taken in daylight are a little grainy, and the edges of objects can be rough. The Redmi 5 also isn't great with subjects that might move, such as animals. We were able to take some good macros, but only if we were very still and there was space between our subjects and their backgrounds. At night, shots came out grainy and often blurred. ""Smart Beautification"" is on by default when you take selfies, and while they come out looking artificially over-processed, they're better than the noisy, murky shots you'd get normally. Video is recorded at 1280x720 by default but can go up to 1920x1080, but it isn't impressive either. Panning isn't smooth, and the constant autofocus adjustment was jarring. VerdictXiaomi will undoubtedly sell massive numbers of the Redmi 5, and you do get a lot of bang for your buck. As usual, the Chinese giant continues to offer specifications that will be very hard for competitors to match. The processor is powerful enough to last for several years, and you get the 18:9 screen that most people want in their next phones. It's likely that the middle variant, with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, will be the most popular. This is the one we used for our review, and we would spend the extra Rs. 1,000 over the base model because 2GB of RAM doesn't seem like much for even low-end Android phones these days. Unfortunately, we can't yet say for sure how different the experience would be with either 2GB or 4GB of RAM. We were impressed with the Redmi 5's battery life and the overall usage experience. MIUI has a lot of nice touches but the outdated version of Android underpinning it was a letdown. The phone is slated to get MIUI 9.5 in April, but even that is based on Android Nougat. The cameras are also not great by any standard, and you should consider going for a higher-end phone if photography is important to you. Xiaomi has definitely raised the bar for budget smartphones once again. We're eager to see how the competition will respond. Is Xiaomi Redmi 5 the most value-for-money smartphone in India?

You have three choices when it comes to storage and RAM - you can buy the Redmi 5 with either 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, or 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. All other specifications are the same across variants. We have the middle one in for review, and we suspect that this will be the most popular option. Potential buyers will be tempted by the minor price difference between the base variant and this one, but the top variant is a bit too expensive and overlaps with the Redmi Note 5. You could buy the Redmi Note 5 with 32GB of storage plus a 32GB microSD card for less than what the 64GB Redmi 5 costs. The battery capacity is about average for Android phones, at 3300mAh, and there's no support for fast charging.

Xiaomi's custom skin is up to date, so we have MIUI 9.2.7, and it has a lot of fans because of how polished it is.

MIUI is easy enough to get around, though you might have to search for some of the things you need in the Settings app.    All the regular apps and games we use to test with ran quite well, with no lag. Only the heaviest games stuttered a little when loading, but not during gameplay. We were also happy to note that the Redmi 5 didn't get very warm when doing anything intense.

2240,21,redmi-5-review-xiaomi-1828665,8,10,2018-03-26,1828665,Jamshed Avari,Redmi 5 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/redmi-5-review-xiaomi-1828665," Chinese giant Xiaomi offers a dizzying number of low-cost smartphones, each with multiple variants - at present, there are no fewer than sixteen different choices priced between Rs. 5,999 and Rs. 13,999 on its official website. There are multiple overlaps, so you can choose a smaller screen and lower-end processor if you want more RAM and storage, or vice versa. As you move up the price ladder, you have more and more choices, but this is still the budget end of the spectrum, and you have to decide which features and specifications are the most important to you. The new Redmi 5 slots in above the Redmi 5A (Review) and below the Redmi Note 5 (Review), but the lines are blurry because of these overlaps. This new phone covers all the basics and delivers a lot of in-demand features, in a slick, well-built package. Xiaomi has made a name for itself by upsetting the market time and again with solid products at low prices, and we're eager to see if it's managed to do so again. Here's our full review of the new Redmi 5, with everything you need to know.    The Redmi 5 looks a lot like the Redmi Note 5, which was launched in India just last month. That shouldn't be much of a surprise because that phone is known as the Redmi 5 Plus in some other countries. These two phones are much more visually aligned than the Redmi Note 5 and Note 5 Pro (Review), so we wonder why Xiaomi decided to group them this way. Predictably, there's a large 18:9 screen on the front. It's taller, but it isn't just filling space that used to be plastic, and we wouldn't call it bezel-free. There are still fairly prominent borders on the sides, and the forehead and chin are quite thick as well. Compared to its predecessor, the Redmi 5's body has been stretched vertically by just over 12mm, and it's also approximately 3mm wider, but 1mm slimmer. The review unit we received was black, with a matching black frame under the front glass, and a lot of people will choose this neutral option. The company is also offering this phone in the gold and rose gold options that we've seen hundreds of times by now, but there's a unique Lake Blue option which you can go for if you want to stand out. All three of those have white front faces.    Xiaomi claims to have used 2.5D curved-edge glass for the front, but the curve is barely visible. The sides, top, and bottom of the Redmi 5 are plastic and there's a metal plate across most of the back. The main camera is centred at the top of the rear, and sticks out by about 1mm. Below it is a single-LED flash (unlike the dual-LED one in exactly the same spot on the Redmi Note 5) and the fingerprint sensor which is easy enough to reach thanks to the overall size and proportions of the body. The power and volume buttons are on the right, and there's a hybrid dual-SIM tray on the left, so you'll have to choose between a second SIM and a microSD card. On the top, you'll find a 3.5mm headset socket, secondary mic, and Xiaomi's trademark infrared emitter for controlling appliances. We're somewhat surprised to see a Micro-USB port on the bottom rather than the newer Type-C. Another feature that's common with budget phones is that only one of the two symmetrical grilles on the bottom is actually a speaker. Build quality, and the overall fit and finish, are impressive for a phone at this price level. The only issue we had was that the ring around the rear camera is a bit too scratchy. Otherwise, this is a pretty comfortable phone to hold and use, and strikes a good balance between screen size and portability. Thankfully, smudges and fingerprints aren't a huge problem on the front or rear.    Our Xiaomi Redmi 5's retail box screams ""Redmi"", but the Xiaomi name is once again barely there, and relegated to one corner. Inside, you'll find a dark-tinted translucent flexible plastic case, a pretty bulky 2A charger, a Micro-USB cable, SIM eject tool, quick start guide, and warranty leaflet. Xiaomi doesn't bundled headsets with its phones, but it's happy to sell you one of the several models listed on its website. Compared to last year's Redmi 4 (Review), there are some substantial updates with this new model.

Here's our full review of the new Redmi 5, with everything you need to know.    The Redmi 5 looks a lot like the Redmi Note 5, which was launched in India just last month. That shouldn't be much of a surprise because that phone is known as the Redmi 5 Plus in some other countries. These two phones are much more visually aligned than the Redmi Note 5 and Note 5 Pro (Review), so we wonder why Xiaomi decided to group them this way. Predictably, there's a large 18:9 screen on the front. It's taller, but it isn't just filling space that used to be plastic, and we wouldn't call it bezel-free. There are still fairly prominent borders on the sides, and the forehead and chin are quite thick as well. Compared to its predecessor, the Redmi 5's body has been stretched vertically by just over 12mm, and it's also approximately 3mm wider, but 1mm slimmer. The review unit we received was black, with a matching black frame under the front glass, and a lot of people will choose this neutral option. The company is also offering this phone in the gold and rose gold options that we've seen hundreds of times by now, but there's a unique Lake Blue option which you can go for if you want to stand out. All three of those have white front faces.    Xiaomi claims to have used 2.5D curved-edge glass for the front, but the curve is barely visible. The sides, top, and bottom of the Redmi 5 are plastic and there's a metal plate across most of the back. The main camera is centred at the top of the rear, and sticks out by about 1mm. Below it is a single-LED flash (unlike the dual-LED one in exactly the same spot on the Redmi Note 5) and the fingerprint sensor which is easy enough to reach thanks to the overall size and proportions of the body. The power and volume buttons are on the right, and there's a hybrid dual-SIM tray on the left, so you'll have to choose between a second SIM and a microSD card. On the top, you'll find a 3.5mm headset socket, secondary mic, and Xiaomi's trademark infrared emitter for controlling appliances. We're somewhat surprised to see a Micro-USB port on the bottom rather than the newer Type-C. Another feature that's common with budget phones is that only one of the two symmetrical grilles on the bottom is actually a speaker. Build quality, and the overall fit and finish, are impressive for a phone at this price level. The only issue we had was that the ring around the rear camera is a bit too scratchy. Otherwise, this is a pretty comfortable phone to hold and use, and strikes a good balance between screen size and portability. Thankfully, smudges and fingerprints aren't a huge problem on the front or rear.    Our Xiaomi Redmi 5's retail box screams ""Redmi"", but the Xiaomi name is once again barely there, and relegated to one corner. Inside, you'll find a dark-tinted translucent flexible plastic case, a pretty bulky 2A charger, a Micro-USB cable, SIM eject tool, quick start guide, and warranty leaflet. Xiaomi doesn't bundled headsets with its phones, but it's happy to sell you one of the several models listed on its website. Compared to last year's Redmi 4 (Review), there are some substantial updates with this new model. First and foremost is the taller screen, which now measures 5.7 inches diagonally and is considerably larger than the 5-inch screen on the Redmi 4. The resolution is 720x1440, which is sharp enough for us. The processor gets a bump up to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 450, which is pretty powerful considering that we haven't seen it in any other sub-Rs. 10,000 phone before. You have three choices when it comes to storage and RAM - you can buy the Redmi 5 with either 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, or 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. All other specifications are the same across variants. We have the middle one in for review, and we suspect that this will be the most popular option. Potential buyers will be tempted by the minor price difference between the base variant and this one, but the top variant is a bit too expensive and overlaps with the Redmi Note 5. You could buy the Redmi Note 5 with 32GB of storage plus a 32GB microSD card for less than what the 64GB Redmi 5 costs. The battery capacity is about average for Android phones, at 3300mAh, and there's no support for fast charging. The rear camera has a 12-megapixel sensor with PDAF and an f/2.2 lens plus a single-LED flash, while the one in front has a 5-megapixel sensor and LED illuminator. The Redmi 5 supports Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, and 4G with VoLTE.    We're a little surprised and disappointed to see that Xiaomi is still using Android 7.1.2 for this phone. Xiaomi's custom skin is up to date, so we have MIUI 9.2.7, and it has a lot of fans because of how polished it is. Still, we would have liked some native Android features such as the ability to long-press an app icon to see contextual actions and notifications. Xiaomi says that bundled notifications and inline replies are supported in its notifications shade, but while this was true for SMS messages, Gmail wasn't supported. You can multitask with some apps running side-by-side on the screen, as long as they support it. The screen to the left of the first home screen is called App Vault, and it shows useful action shortcuts and widgets for certain apps. By default, there are widgets to show cricket scores and let you book Ola cabs, once you enter your personal information. Mi Drop is a simple Apple AirDrop clone that lets you send and receive files directly from other phones, but the app is now available to all Android users, making it potentially very useful. Mi Remote lets you control multiple household appliances via infrared, while Mi Home is for Xiaomi's own smart home products that have Wi-Fi built in. The Apps store is fairly straightforward and offers several popular apps and games. The Themes app has hundreds of downloadable themes as well as wallpapers, ringtones, fonts, and for some reason, also ""pop apps"" - which promise to be small apps that you can run without installation, but just redirected us to either the Xiaomi or Google Play stores when we tried them. Finally, Mi Community combines Xiaomi updates, a Q&A forum, a store for Xiaomi phones and accessories, and tutorials for MIUI. As we expected, performance was generally pleasant. We didn't have any trouble getting set up or using this phone for work or entertainment. A lot of apps work perfectly well on 18:9 screens already, and the rest are accommodated with blank space above and below their content which is masked well. MIUI is easy enough to get around, though you might have to search for some of the things you need in the Settings app.    All the regular apps and games we use to test with ran quite well, with no lag. Only the heaviest games stuttered a little when loading, but not during gameplay. We were also happy to note that the Redmi 5 didn't get very warm when doing anything intense. Throughout our time with this phone, we found the screen to be a bit dull, with colours that didn't really pop. Videos and games still looked fine, but we could tell that photos weren't looking their best on this screen. The single speaker can get extremely loud but the sound is harsh and will distort at higher volume levels. We were able to stretch a single charge through a full day of casual usage involving some gaming, video streaming, camera use and Web surfing, with a little bit left over the next morning. Our HD video loop battery test ran for 13 hours and 36 minutes, which is impressive. Fast charging would have been nice, but that might be asking for too much at these prices. Half an hour of charging only got us up to 32 percent, and a full hour gave us 62 percent. We got a score of 69,812 in AnTuTu 7, and Geekbench 4 gave us 759 and 3,490 points respectively in its single- and multi-threaded tests. Graphics performance wasn't bad at all, with scores of 32fps in the GFXBench T-Rex run and 7,931 in 3DMark's Ice Storm Extreme test.  Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi 5 camera samples   The cameras on the Redmi 5 are good, but not great, and this is where most budget phones stumble. Photos definitely look sharper on the phone's own screen than they do on a large monitor. When you check them out at full size, you'll see that details are lacking and textures aren't reproduced well. Shots taken in daylight are a little grainy, and the edges of objects can be rough. The Redmi 5 also isn't great with subjects that might move, such as animals. We were able to take some good macros, but only if we were very still and there was space between our subjects and their backgrounds. At night, shots came out grainy and often blurred. ""Smart Beautification"" is on by default when you take selfies, and while they come out looking artificially over-processed, they're better than the noisy, murky shots you'd get normally. Video is recorded at 1280x720 by default but can go up to 1920x1080, but it isn't impressive either. Panning isn't smooth, and the constant autofocus adjustment was jarring. VerdictXiaomi will undoubtedly sell massive numbers of the Redmi 5, and you do get a lot of bang for your buck. As usual, the Chinese giant continues to offer specifications that will be very hard for competitors to match. The processor is powerful enough to last for several years, and you get the 18:9 screen that most people want in their next phones. It's likely that the middle variant, with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, will be the most popular. This is the one we used for our review, and we would spend the extra Rs. 1,000 over the base model because 2GB of RAM doesn't seem like much for even low-end Android phones these days. Unfortunately, we can't yet say for sure how different the experience would be with either 2GB or 4GB of RAM. We were impressed with the Redmi 5's battery life and the overall usage experience. MIUI has a lot of nice touches but the outdated version of Android underpinning it was a letdown. The phone is slated to get MIUI 9.5 in April, but even that is based on Android Nougat. The cameras are also not great by any standard, and you should consider going for a higher-end phone if photography is important to you. Xiaomi has definitely raised the bar for budget smartphones once again. We're eager to see how the competition will respond. Is Xiaomi Redmi 5 the most value-for-money smartphone in India?

There are multiple overlaps, so you can choose a smaller screen and lower-end processor if you want more RAM and storage, or vice versa. As you move up the price ladder, you have more and more choices, but this is still the budget end of the spectrum, and you have to decide which features and specifications are the most important to you.

We were able to take some good macros, but only if we were very still and there was space between our subjects and their backgrounds. At night, shots came out grainy and often blurred. ""Smart Beautification"" is on by default when you take selfies, and while they come out looking artificially over-processed, they're better than the noisy, murky shots you'd get normally. Video is recorded at 1280x720 by default but can go up to 1920x1080, but it isn't impressive either. Panning isn't smooth, and the constant autofocus adjustment was jarring. VerdictXiaomi will undoubtedly sell massive numbers of the Redmi 5, and you do get a lot of bang for your buck. As usual, the Chinese giant continues to offer specifications that will be very hard for competitors to match. The processor is powerful enough to last for several years, and you get the 18:9 screen that most people want in their next phones. It's likely that the middle variant, with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, will be the most popular. This is the one we used for our review, and we would spend the extra Rs. 1,000 over the base model because 2GB of RAM doesn't seem like much for even low-end Android phones these days. Unfortunately, we can't yet say for sure how different the experience would be with either 2GB or 4GB of RAM. We were impressed with the Redmi 5's battery life and the overall usage experience. MIUI has a lot of nice touches but the outdated version of Android underpinning it was a letdown. The phone is slated to get MIUI 9.5 in April, but even that is based on Android Nougat. The cameras are also not great by any standard, and you should consider going for a higher-end phone if photography is important to you. Xiaomi has definitely raised the bar for budget smartphones once again. We're eager to see how the competition will respond. Is Xiaomi Redmi 5 the most value-for-money smartphone in India?

2240,21,redmi-5-review-xiaomi-1828665,8,10,2018-03-26,1828665,Jamshed Avari,Redmi 5 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/redmi-5-review-xiaomi-1828665," Chinese giant Xiaomi offers a dizzying number of low-cost smartphones, each with multiple variants - at present, there are no fewer than sixteen different choices priced between Rs. 5,999 and Rs. 13,999 on its official website. There are multiple overlaps, so you can choose a smaller screen and lower-end processor if you want more RAM and storage, or vice versa. As you move up the price ladder, you have more and more choices, but this is still the budget end of the spectrum, and you have to decide which features and specifications are the most important to you. The new Redmi 5 slots in above the Redmi 5A (Review) and below the Redmi Note 5 (Review), but the lines are blurry because of these overlaps. This new phone covers all the basics and delivers a lot of in-demand features, in a slick, well-built package. Xiaomi has made a name for itself by upsetting the market time and again with solid products at low prices, and we're eager to see if it's managed to do so again. Here's our full review of the new Redmi 5, with everything you need to know.    The Redmi 5 looks a lot like the Redmi Note 5, which was launched in India just last month. That shouldn't be much of a surprise because that phone is known as the Redmi 5 Plus in some other countries. These two phones are much more visually aligned than the Redmi Note 5 and Note 5 Pro (Review), so we wonder why Xiaomi decided to group them this way. Predictably, there's a large 18:9 screen on the front. It's taller, but it isn't just filling space that used to be plastic, and we wouldn't call it bezel-free. There are still fairly prominent borders on the sides, and the forehead and chin are quite thick as well. Compared to its predecessor, the Redmi 5's body has been stretched vertically by just over 12mm, and it's also approximately 3mm wider, but 1mm slimmer. The review unit we received was black, with a matching black frame under the front glass, and a lot of people will choose this neutral option. The company is also offering this phone in the gold and rose gold options that we've seen hundreds of times by now, but there's a unique Lake Blue option which you can go for if you want to stand out. All three of those have white front faces.    Xiaomi claims to have used 2.5D curved-edge glass for the front, but the curve is barely visible. The sides, top, and bottom of the Redmi 5 are plastic and there's a metal plate across most of the back. The main camera is centred at the top of the rear, and sticks out by about 1mm. Below it is a single-LED flash (unlike the dual-LED one in exactly the same spot on the Redmi Note 5) and the fingerprint sensor which is easy enough to reach thanks to the overall size and proportions of the body. The power and volume buttons are on the right, and there's a hybrid dual-SIM tray on the left, so you'll have to choose between a second SIM and a microSD card. On the top, you'll find a 3.5mm headset socket, secondary mic, and Xiaomi's trademark infrared emitter for controlling appliances. We're somewhat surprised to see a Micro-USB port on the bottom rather than the newer Type-C. Another feature that's common with budget phones is that only one of the two symmetrical grilles on the bottom is actually a speaker. Build quality, and the overall fit and finish, are impressive for a phone at this price level. The only issue we had was that the ring around the rear camera is a bit too scratchy. Otherwise, this is a pretty comfortable phone to hold and use, and strikes a good balance between screen size and portability. Thankfully, smudges and fingerprints aren't a huge problem on the front or rear.    Our Xiaomi Redmi 5's retail box screams ""Redmi"", but the Xiaomi name is once again barely there, and relegated to one corner. Inside, you'll find a dark-tinted translucent flexible plastic case, a pretty bulky 2A charger, a Micro-USB cable, SIM eject tool, quick start guide, and warranty leaflet. Xiaomi doesn't bundled headsets with its phones, but it's happy to sell you one of the several models listed on its website. Compared to last year's Redmi 4 (Review), there are some substantial updates with this new model. First and foremost is the taller screen, which now measures 5.7 inches diagonally and is considerably larger than the 5-inch screen on the Redmi 4. The resolution is 720x1440, which is sharp enough for us. The processor gets a bump up to Qualcomm's Snapdragon 450, which is pretty powerful considering that we haven't seen it in any other sub-Rs. 10,000 phone before. You have three choices when it comes to storage and RAM - you can buy the Redmi 5 with either 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, or 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. All other specifications are the same across variants. We have the middle one in for review, and we suspect that this will be the most popular option. Potential buyers will be tempted by the minor price difference between the base variant and this one, but the top variant is a bit too expensive and overlaps with the Redmi Note 5. You could buy the Redmi Note 5 with 32GB of storage plus a 32GB microSD card for less than what the 64GB Redmi 5 costs. The battery capacity is about average for Android phones, at 3300mAh, and there's no support for fast charging. The rear camera has a 12-megapixel sensor with PDAF and an f/2.2 lens plus a single-LED flash, while the one in front has a 5-megapixel sensor and LED illuminator. The Redmi 5 supports Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.2, GPS, and 4G with VoLTE.    We're a little surprised and disappointed to see that Xiaomi is still using Android 7.1.2 for this phone. Xiaomi's custom skin is up to date, so we have MIUI 9.2.7, and it has a lot of fans because of how polished it is. Still, we would have liked some native Android features such as the ability to long-press an app icon to see contextual actions and notifications. Xiaomi says that bundled notifications and inline replies are supported in its notifications shade, but while this was true for SMS messages, Gmail wasn't supported. You can multitask with some apps running side-by-side on the screen, as long as they support it. The screen to the left of the first home screen is called App Vault, and it shows useful action shortcuts and widgets for certain apps. By default, there are widgets to show cricket scores and let you book Ola cabs, once you enter your personal information. Mi Drop is a simple Apple AirDrop clone that lets you send and receive files directly from other phones, but the app is now available to all Android users, making it potentially very useful. Mi Remote lets you control multiple household appliances via infrared, while Mi Home is for Xiaomi's own smart home products that have Wi-Fi built in. The Apps store is fairly straightforward and offers several popular apps and games. The Themes app has hundreds of downloadable themes as well as wallpapers, ringtones, fonts, and for some reason, also ""pop apps"" - which promise to be small apps that you can run without installation, but just redirected us to either the Xiaomi or Google Play stores when we tried them. Finally, Mi Community combines Xiaomi updates, a Q&A forum, a store for Xiaomi phones and accessories, and tutorials for MIUI. As we expected, performance was generally pleasant. We didn't have any trouble getting set up or using this phone for work or entertainment. A lot of apps work perfectly well on 18:9 screens already, and the rest are accommodated with blank space above and below their content which is masked well. MIUI is easy enough to get around, though you might have to search for some of the things you need in the Settings app.    All the regular apps and games we use to test with ran quite well, with no lag. Only the heaviest games stuttered a little when loading, but not during gameplay. We were also happy to note that the Redmi 5 didn't get very warm when doing anything intense. Throughout our time with this phone, we found the screen to be a bit dull, with colours that didn't really pop. Videos and games still looked fine, but we could tell that photos weren't looking their best on this screen. The single speaker can get extremely loud but the sound is harsh and will distort at higher volume levels. We were able to stretch a single charge through a full day of casual usage involving some gaming, video streaming, camera use and Web surfing, with a little bit left over the next morning. Our HD video loop battery test ran for 13 hours and 36 minutes, which is impressive. Fast charging would have been nice, but that might be asking for too much at these prices. Half an hour of charging only got us up to 32 percent, and a full hour gave us 62 percent. We got a score of 69,812 in AnTuTu 7, and Geekbench 4 gave us 759 and 3,490 points respectively in its single- and multi-threaded tests. Graphics performance wasn't bad at all, with scores of 32fps in the GFXBench T-Rex run and 7,931 in 3DMark's Ice Storm Extreme test.

Photos definitely look sharper on the phone's own screen than they do on a large monitor. When you check them out at full size, you'll see that details are lacking and textures aren't reproduced well. Shots taken in daylight are a little grainy, and the edges of objects can be rough.

2220,21,redmi-5a-review-1784502,7,10,2017-12-07,1784502,Jamshed Avari,Redmi 5A Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/redmi-5a-review-1784502," Xiaomi has been crowding the budget smartphone market with multiple models and variants at overlapping price points, all with impressive specifications that the competition has struggled to match. At the lowest end, the Redmi 4A (Review) has been a compelling phone ever since its launch in India eight months ago, and we have recommended it to anyone on a water-tight budget. Now, Xiaomi is replacing its entry-level Redmi 4A with the Redmi 5A and making a really big deal about this launch even though there's very little difference between the two models. In a sea of patriotically named phones such as Micromax's Bharat line and the Karbonn A40 Indian (Review), Xiaomi is positioning the Redmi 5A as a desh ka smartphone. What exactly qualifies it for that title is unclear - it might be its low price, the fact that it's made in India, or its promise of exceptional battery life. Perhaps the most interesting thing about this launch is Xiaomi's limited-time Rs. 1,000 discount on the lower-end model, which brings the price down to a very tempting Rs. 4,999. We're curious to see what exactly has changed, and what buyers stand to gain. Here's our full review.    There isn't much to say about the Redmi 5A's looks if you've used any entry-level Android smartphone over the past year or two. It's all plastic, though the rear has a slightly metallic finish. Xiaomi says it will be sold in Dark Grey, Gold, and Rose Gold, though only the first two are listed as options for the first sale. Our Gold unit had a white front face, and we feel that the Dark Grey option with a black front would be more to our tastes. The Redmi 5A has a 5-inch screen and there's quite a lot of plastic above and below it. Still, it's well suited to one-handed use. Grip is pretty good despite the 8.35mm thickness, and weight is quite manageable at 137g. When compared to the Redmi 4A, the differences are purely cosmetic. The two models vary by less than 1mm in terms of height and width. There are capacitive navigation buttons below the screen which aren't backlit, but that's only to be expected at this price level. In a familiar Xiaomi touch, there's a status indicator right below the Home button which is completely invisible until it lights up when you're charging the phone. The power and volume buttons are on the right, and there are two trays on the left - one for a single Nano-SIM, and another for a microSD card as well as another SIM. The camera at the back has a single-LED flash next to it, and the phone's speaker grille runs along the entire lower back. There's a Micro-USB port on the bottom and a 3.5mm audio socket on the top. One interesting touch is the presence of an IR emitter on the top, which you can use to control household appliances. You get a charger and a Micro-USB cable in the box, but as usual, no headset. Interestingly, the company seems to be moving towards using Redmi as more than just a name for one product line - the box screams ""Redmi 5A"" on the front, sides and back, while the Xiaomi name and logo are much smaller and are almost tucked away out of sight.  It's a bit surprising that the Redmi 5A's specifications are pretty much identical to those of the Redmi 4A, which it replaces. You get the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor, with four cores clocked at 1.4GHz. The screen measures 5 inches diagonally and has a resolution of 720x1280. There's a 13-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front camera. Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.1, FM radio, and GPS are supported. You can choose between a base variant with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage, and a more expensive one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The changes, if you can even spot them, are extremely subtle. The Redmi 5A actually has a slightly smaller battery, at 3000mAh down from 3120mAh. It also has a dedicated microSD card slot rather than the Redmi 4A's hybrid dual-SIM arrangement. It uses Nano-SIMs rather than Micro-SIMS, and the maximum supported microSD capacity has gone up from 128GB to 256GB. That's pretty much it - one feature that's slightly worse, and one that's a bit better. Unsurprisingly, with the exception of the IR emitter, the Redmi 5A has no extras compared to its predecessor. Rather than spotlighting one particular feature such as a fingerprint reader, a front flash, a huge battery, secondary rear camera or an 18:9 screen, Xiaomi has chosen to stick with pushing out a workhorse all-rounder at this price level.  At least things are a bit fresher on the software side. Xiaomi ships the Redmi 5A with Android 7.1.2, and version 9 of its custom MIUI skin running on top. This is single-layered UI with no way to enable an app drawer, which might not be a bad thing for first-time Android users. We noticed a few unnecessary animations on the home screen icons and when scrolling through long lists. There are a few themes you can choose from and hundreds more that you can download through the Themes app. You can also download individual wallpapers, fonts, and ringtones. These all appear to be free for now, but Xiaomi could start making money off downloads like this in the future. If you dig through the Settings app, you'll find options for splitting the quick toggles out into a separate panel within the notifications shade; configuring a ""Second Space"" user profile for privacy; setting up gesture shortcuts; and assigning extra functions to the Android navigation keys. There's also Dual Apps functionality which lets you run a second instance of any app for use with a second account; and App Lock which lets you restrict app access - since there's no fingerprint reader, you have to use an unlock pattern to use this feature. Xiaomi preloads a few Microsoft Office apps, Skype Lite, Amazon Shopping, WPS Office, and UC news. There's a spammy ticker of ""Promoted apps"" within an ordinary-looking home screen folder to encourage you to download them. Other Xiaomi features include the Mi Apps app store, Mi Store for Xiaomi products, Mi Community forum app, Mi Drop (an Apple AirDrop clone), and assorted custom apps that replace the default Android ones.  As far as entry-level phones go, Xiaomi has done well in balancing cost and performance. The Redmi 5A is capable of handling everyday tasks such as Web browsing, social apps, and messaging. We were even able to play a few heavy games, though performance wasn’t perfectly smooth. There was usually less than 500MB of free RAM out of our review unit's 2GB. We found the phone stuttering slightly when switching apps sometimes, but only really struggling when we ran heavy tests or games. Things also definitely took a turn for the worse with the Second Space feature enabled. Benchmark scores were decent enough. We got 36,421 in AnTuTu; 683 and 1,887 in Geekbench 4's single-core and multi-core tests respectively; 3,719 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme; and 14fps in GFXBench. Our test phone was the variant with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage - it stands to reason that the more expensive variant's additional RAM will make performance smoother. The screen is pretty sharp, and even fine text looks good. Viewing angles are great, and brightness is high enough for outdoor use. However, colours don't really pop and we found that videos and games looked a bit dull. Although the speaker grille runs across the back of the phone, there's only one spot that sound actually comes out of, and the Redmi 5A is muffled easily when lying face-up on a soft surface such as a bed. Sound is pretty weak and distorts badly at high volumes. If you swipe to the right from the Redmi 5A's lock screen, you'll see a menu with shortcuts to the Mi Remote app and something called Mi Home. The remote app is basic and unfortunately the process of figuring out how to control your TVs and other appliances requires some trial and error. There are IR profiles for Indian TV, set-top box, and AC brands including private-label store brands. Unlike with some other low-end phones, third-party apps can use the IR emitter.  The Redmi 5A's cameras are quite mediocre, but once again we have to balance our expectations against this phone's low price. Photos don't have a lot of detail - objects often have fuzzy borders, and textures aren't reproduced very well. We found that colours were pretty dull, and not just when checking photos on the phone's own screen. We were able to take some decent close-ups but anything at a distance suffered. At night, there was a serious drop in quality, and it was hard to capture anything that didn't have artificial light falling directly on it. On the plus side, autofocus was usually quick to lock during the daytime. Video recording goes up to 1080p, but we found that clips looked quite artificial and weren't very smooth. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi 5A camera samples The front camera applies pretty aggressive beautification by default, making faces look extremely artificial. There's a Pro beauty mode and a Smart beauty mode, the difference being that Pro mode gives you individual ""Slim"" and ""Skin"" sliders while Smart tries to guess your age and gender. When disabled, it's clear that the front camera is pretty weak. The camera app isn't very well laid out, for example it takes two taps to get to the options menu from the default mode, but in some modes you can't get to it at all. Xiaomi has boasted about the Redmi 5A's battery life as part of its ""desh ka smartphone"" pitch, and we were pleased to note that we could in fact get through a full day of casual use with up to 20 percent left over. Our HD video loop test went on for 11 hours, 9 minutes which is quite impressive. VerdictXiaomi continues to impress us with its low prices, and even though the Redmi 5A doesn't give us anything new or different compared to the Redmi 4A, it still delivers excellent value. If you can grab the 2GB/16GB version at the introductory offer price of Rs. 4,999, you'll be very happy. Even at its regular retail price of Rs. 5,999, there aren't many phones that could compete with it. If you're a first-time smartphone user, or are only concerned with basic communications, the Redmi 5A would be quite a good choice. Camera quality is really the only major downside, and if that's important to you, you'll have to spend a bit more. For the same reasons, the 3GB/32GB version of the Redmi 5A is less compelling. There are other options to consider that let you trade the additional RAM and storage for features such as a larger screen and fingerprint reader, most notably Xiaomi's own Redmi 4 (Review) and Redmi Y1 Lite. We're also not too far from the launch of the Redmi 5 with its fashionable 18:9 display, though that model is likely to cost a little more. Is Xiaomi Redmi 5A truly 'desh ka smartphone'?

2499,21,redmi-7-review-xiaomi-india-mi-7-price-2029081,8,10,2019-04-28,2029081,Jamshed Avari,Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/redmi-7-review-xiaomi-india-mi-7-price-2029081," It's been just over seven months since the launch of the Redmi 6 series in India, but in the smartphone world that's a lifetime. New features such as waterdrop notches and gradient designs have become popular, and competitors aren't standing still. Xiaomi isn't the only company constantly fighting to improve specifications and features in low-cost phones. The newly reinvigorated Samsung, in particular, poses a significant threat with its reasonably priced A-series and M-series models, which have been selling quite well since their launch. It's no surprise then that Xiaomi has already refreshed its sub-Rs. 8,000 offering. The newly announced Redmi 7 is a workhorse all-rounder that should appeal to anyone. It seems to offer nearly everything that buyers might want, and the focus is on overall value rather than any one major feature. Interestingly, Xiaomi hasn't launched Redmi 7 Pro or Redmi 7A companion models – not yet at least. In this review, we're focusing on the Redmi 7, and we're going to see whether Xiaomi has managed to deliver enough to stay ahead of Samsung, Honor, Realme, and other competitors.    Many of Xiaomi's previous phones have looked very similar, but the Redmi 7 breaks the mould. The company has completely ditched the metallic look of the Redmi 6 (Review), and has embraced multi-coloured glossy plastic just like many of its competitors have. There are three colours to choose from – the plain Eclipse Black — which we got for review — and the more eye-catching Comet Blue and Lunar Red. The latter two feature colour gradients on their rear panels. Xiaomi calls this its ‘Aura Smoke' look. The Comet Blue option features dark purple merging into bright blue, while Lunar Red is black at the top fading into red on the bottom. While not everyone will love this, the overall effect is a little subtler than some of the other designs we've seen recently. If you don't like these finishes, you can use the dark translucent plastic cover that comes in the box. Phones have been growing bigger, and the Redmi 7 is no exception. Its 6.26 inch screen is much larger than the 5.45-inch one on the Redmi 6, but that isn't just because of slimmer borders. The Redmi 7 is significantly bigger than its predecessor in all dimensions, and heavier too. At 180g and 8.47mm in thickness, this phone is quite a handful, and you'll feel its heft in your pocket when walking around. It also isn't easy to reach all corners of the screen with just the thumb. With this generation, even the low-cost Redmi 7 gets a modern “dot” notch, though we have to say that if you're looking for a borderless screen, this phone doesn't quite fit that description. The good news is that Xiaomi has used Gorilla Glass 5 for the display, which should give you some peace of mind. Redmi 7 sports a modern “dot” notch   The back of this phone is made out moulded plastic, which Xiaomi says has been “finished with a nano-spray”. Our plain black review unit was glossy and highly reflective, and didn't have any noticeable texture. Sadly, it did get very grimy with fingerprints and smudges within moments of us unboxing this phone. We also noticed that dust and tiny fibres tended to stick to the back. It's impossible to keep the Redmi 7 looking fresh which is a pity. We saw major scratches and scuffs after less than a week of careful handling. The edges where the glossy rear panel meets the matte plastic frame aren't perfectly smooth and this phone is somewhat awkward to use. Thankfully the fingerprint sensor on the rear and the power and volume buttons on the right are within easy reach. There's a very slim earpiece right above the front camera notch, and the sensors are hidden. A tiny white LED embedded in the chin below the screen lights up when this phone is charging and goes off when the battery is full. The rear dual-camera module sticks out just a tiny bit and doesn't get in the way of anything. On the top of this phone, you'll find a 3.5mm headset socket and an infrared emitter for controlling appliances with. A single tray on the upper left can hold two Nano-SIMs as well as a microSD card, which is always good to see. Of the two grilles on the bottom, only one is actually a speaker. We would have liked a USB Type-C port, but we can't complain about the use of the Micro-USB standard at this price, and at least a lot of people will be able to recycle old cables. Not everyone will like the plastic body and colourful gradients, or the fact that this phone is rather bulky and unwieldy. If you like bigger phones, you'll find the Redmi 7 much more attractive than its predecessors at the same price. Back of the Redmi 7 is made out moulded plastic   At the heart of the new Redmi 7 is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 SoC which is a considerable improvement over not only the Redmi 6's MediaTek Helio P22, but also the Snapdragon 625 in the Redmi 6 Pro (Review). It has eight of Qualcomm's own Kryo 250 CPU cores running at up to 1.8GHz, and integrated Adreno 506 graphics. Xiaomi has launched two variants of the Redmi 7 in India, and both have 32GB of eMMC storage. The only difference is that the base variant priced at Rs. 7,999 has 2GB of RAM, and the Rs. 8,999 variant has 3GB of RAM. That doesn't make a lot of sense to us. If you're willing to pay Rs. 1,000 more, you could buy the Redmi Note 7 (Review) instead. It's also a small step backwards compared to the Redmi 6, which had 3GB of RAM across variants and a choice of 32GB of storage at the same price or 64GB for Rs. 1,500 more. The 6.26-inch screen has a resolution of 720x1520 and an aspect ratio of 19:9. Xiaomi says you get 84 percent of the NTSC colour gamut which is decent enough for a low-cost phone. There's a 4000mAh battery which is a big bump up from 3000mAh on the Redmi 6, and while Qualcomm's Quick Charge isn't explicitly supported, the bundled charger is rated at 10W. The Redmi 7 supports 4G and VoLTE on both SIMs, as well as single-band Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.2, and GPS. There's an electronic compass plus the usual accelerometer and ambient light sensor, but no gyroscope. Our diagnostics showed that this phone supports Widevine L3 DRM, not L1 for full-HD video streaming. The rear dual-camera module on the Redmi 7 sticks out just a tiny bit   Our review unit was running MIUI 10.2 on top of Android 9 Pie. During the initial setup process there's an option to disable “Wallpaper Carousel” stories on the lock screen, which can include some ads and sponsored content. You'll see a different item every time you unlock your phone. Interestingly, this is exactly the same platform we've encountered on Samsung's latest phones. It's powered by a third-party app called Glance. We saw fewer blatant ads and better-designed snippets than we did when reviewing the Samsung Galaxy M20 (Review), but it's still annoying. When disabled, there's a permanent icon on the lock screen leading you to an option to turn it back on. MIUI doesn't give you the option of an app drawer so all icons are on the home screens. If you swipe right from the first home screen, you'll come to a page called App Vault which has various panels including shortcuts to specific tasks within certain apps. There are also ads for “recommended apps”, contests, and app integrations here. The MIUI task switcher has a tiled layout which is actually quite handy. The Second Space feature is a separate profile for private apps and data, which you can delete and reset anytime. Dual Apps lets you run two instances of nearly any app, not just messengers. We noticed that when installing any app from the Google Play store, an “app checker” screen with an ad would pop up. The default Facemoji keyboard offers loads of ASCII text effects, emojis, GIFs, stickers, and themes. There's a Mi Apps store and several first-party apps, and as we've seen before there are ads in many of them.  The Music app lets you stream songs from Hungama without any account setup process. An app called Security has a virus scanner and some privacy tools, but also for some reason includes a “game speed booster” and the battery and storage controls that are usually in the Settings app. Of course there are ads everywhere, including full-screen interstitials. The Redmi 7 packs the traditional Micro-USB port   We received the 3GB RAM version of the Redmi 7 for review, so our experiences might be better than those of people who buy the base variant, which is of course more affordable. Other than the ads throughout MIUI, we found the Redmi 7 easy to use, but a little buggy. There was sometimes very minor lag when calling up and scrolling through the app switcher, most likely due to the thumbnails of all running apps that need to be cached. One rare but odd issue was that notifications would sometimes disappear in less than a second, making them impossible to read.  The screen is a little too reflective, but is decent in terms of quality. With a screen this large, videos and games look great, but text is just a little bit fuzzy. Colours and viewing angles are fine, but sunlight legibility was not very good. We were impressed with the speaker, which can push out loud sound without distortion. It's great for voices in video and music, but of course there isn't much bass or richness to the sound. As is standard for Xiaomi, no headset is included. Our benchmarks showed big performance improvements compared to the Redmi 6 series. AnTuTu gave us 103,574 points and Geekbench's single-core and multi-core scores were 1,247 and 4,333 respectively. The Redmi 7 managed 511 points in 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme test and 14,458 in Ice Storm Unlimited. GFXBench's T-rex and Manhattan 3.1 tests ran at 36fps and 14fps respectively. Asphalt 9: Legends showed up in the Google Play Store as incompatible with this phone, so we couldn't test it. PUBG Mobile ran fine at the Medium preset by default. We did notice the upper back of the phone getting a bit warm after a few rounds. The 4000mAh battery in this phone lasted a very impressive 17 hours, 9 minutes in our HD video loop test. With casual use, including a lot of Web surfing plus a bit of photography, gaming and video streaming, we managed to make it through a full day and still had about 30 percent remaining at night. The Redmi 7 has a 12-megapixel f/2.2 primary rear camera with a 2-megapixel depth sensor. It doesn't have an extra zoom or wide-angle lens, but the app does boast of AI to detect scenes and adjust camera settings automatically. Other than the usual Pro and Portrait modes, there are menus in the photo and video modes with additional options including Tilt-Shift, Beautification, Group Selfie, Time-lapse, and Google Lens. You can take bursts by tapping and holding the shutter button, and there's even a setting to let you choose between average, centre-weighted and spot metering. Tap to see full-sized Redmi 7 camera samples   We liked how our photo samples came out. The shots we took under bright sunlight had sharp focus and subtle details within the focused area, though anything more than a few feet away looked a lot poorer. The Redmi 7 handled exposures well in scenes with bright light as well as shadow, but would have liked a little more vibrancy and punch to the colours. We were pleasantly surprised by how bright low-light shots came out, and even colours were relatively well preserved. However, there was a lot of noise and these photos really didn't look good when we zoomed in. There's also a lot of motion blur and you can expect bright areas to be overexposed thanks to the slow shutter. Videos can be recorded at 1080p 60fps and you can choose between the more widely compatible H.264 and more efficient H.265 codecs. The clips we recorded looked a bit dull and there was a lot of jerkiness. Detail was poor in full-HD videos recorded at night. Beautification is applied automatically when using the 8-megapixel f/2.0 front camera, and it's way too aggressive. VerdictXiaomi has done a lot to improve the Redmi series, and the new Redmi 7 offers better features and specifications as well as more up-to-date looks than the Redmi 6. There are a few steps backwards though – we don't like the reduction in RAM on the base model and lack of a 64GB storage variant. The Redmi Note 7 and Redmi Y3 both start at Rs. 9,999 — Rs. 1,000 more than the top-end Redmi 7 — and it would be very tempting to choose either of those models for the improvements they offer. As for this phone's competition, we have the Realme 3 (Review), Samsung Galaxy M10 (Review), and Asus Zenfone Max M2 (Review) or ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review). Xiaomi does seem to have an advantage in terms of features and specifications overall at its price. However the software experience, particularly all the advertising, is likely to put a lot of people off. Do Redmi 7 and Redmi Y3 prices in India show that Xiaomi's missed a trick?

New features such as waterdrop notches and gradient designs have become popular, and competitors aren't standing still. Xiaomi isn't the only company constantly fighting to improve specifications and features in low-cost phones. The newly reinvigorated Samsung, in particular, poses a significant threat with its reasonably priced A-series and M-series models, which have been selling quite well since their launch. It's no surprise then that Xiaomi has already refreshed its sub-Rs. 8,000 offering. The newly announced Redmi 7 is a workhorse all-rounder that should appeal to anyone. It seems to offer nearly everything that buyers might want, and the focus is on overall value rather than any one major feature. Interestingly, Xiaomi hasn't launched Redmi 7 Pro or Redmi 7A companion models – not yet at least. In this review, we're focusing on the Redmi 7, and we're going to see whether Xiaomi has managed to deliver enough to stay ahead of Samsung, Honor, Realme, and other competitors.    Many of Xiaomi's previous phones have looked very similar, but the Redmi 7 breaks the mould. The company has completely ditched the metallic look of the Redmi 6 (Review), and has embraced multi-coloured glossy plastic just like many of its competitors have. There are three colours to choose from – the plain Eclipse Black — which we got for review — and the more eye-catching Comet Blue and Lunar Red. The latter two feature colour gradients on their rear panels. Xiaomi calls this its ‘Aura Smoke' look. The Comet Blue option features dark purple merging into bright blue, while Lunar Red is black at the top fading into red on the bottom. While not everyone will love this, the overall effect is a little subtler than some of the other designs we've seen recently. If you don't like these finishes, you can use the dark translucent plastic cover that comes in the box. Phones have been growing bigger, and the Redmi 7 is no exception. Its 6.26 inch screen is much larger than the 5.45-inch one on the Redmi 6, but that isn't just because of slimmer borders. The Redmi 7 is significantly bigger than its predecessor in all dimensions, and heavier too. At 180g and 8.47mm in thickness, this phone is quite a handful, and you'll feel its heft in your pocket when walking around. It also isn't easy to reach all corners of the screen with just the thumb. With this generation, even the low-cost Redmi 7 gets a modern “dot” notch, though we have to say that if you're looking for a borderless screen, this phone doesn't quite fit that description. The good news is that Xiaomi has used Gorilla Glass 5 for the display, which should give you some peace of mind. Redmi 7 sports a modern “dot” notch   The back of this phone is made out moulded plastic, which Xiaomi says has been “finished with a nano-spray”. Our plain black review unit was glossy and highly reflective, and didn't have any noticeable texture. Sadly, it did get very grimy with fingerprints and smudges within moments of us unboxing this phone. We also noticed that dust and tiny fibres tended to stick to the back. It's impossible to keep the Redmi 7 looking fresh which is a pity. We saw major scratches and scuffs after less than a week of careful handling. The edges where the glossy rear panel meets the matte plastic frame aren't perfectly smooth and this phone is somewhat awkward to use. Thankfully the fingerprint sensor on the rear and the power and volume buttons on the right are within easy reach. There's a very slim earpiece right above the front camera notch, and the sensors are hidden. A tiny white LED embedded in the chin below the screen lights up when this phone is charging and goes off when the battery is full. The rear dual-camera module sticks out just a tiny bit and doesn't get in the way of anything. On the top of this phone, you'll find a 3.5mm headset socket and an infrared emitter for controlling appliances with. A single tray on the upper left can hold two Nano-SIMs as well as a microSD card, which is always good to see. Of the two grilles on the bottom, only one is actually a speaker. We would have liked a USB Type-C port, but we can't complain about the use of the Micro-USB standard at this price, and at least a lot of people will be able to recycle old cables. Not everyone will like the plastic body and colourful gradients, or the fact that this phone is rather bulky and unwieldy. If you like bigger phones, you'll find the Redmi 7 much more attractive than its predecessors at the same price. Back of the Redmi 7 is made out moulded plastic   At the heart of the new Redmi 7 is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 SoC which is a considerable improvement over not only the Redmi 6's MediaTek Helio P22, but also the Snapdragon 625 in the Redmi 6 Pro (Review). It has eight of Qualcomm's own Kryo 250 CPU cores running at up to 1.8GHz, and integrated Adreno 506 graphics. Xiaomi has launched two variants of the Redmi 7 in India, and both have 32GB of eMMC storage. The only difference is that the base variant priced at Rs. 7,999 has 2GB of RAM, and the Rs. 8,999 variant has 3GB of RAM. That doesn't make a lot of sense to us. If you're willing to pay Rs. 1,000 more, you could buy the Redmi Note 7 (Review) instead. It's also a small step backwards compared to the Redmi 6, which had 3GB of RAM across variants and a choice of 32GB of storage at the same price or 64GB for Rs. 1,500 more. The 6.26-inch screen has a resolution of 720x1520 and an aspect ratio of 19:9. Xiaomi says you get 84 percent of the NTSC colour gamut which is decent enough for a low-cost phone. There's a 4000mAh battery which is a big bump up from 3000mAh on the Redmi 6, and while Qualcomm's Quick Charge isn't explicitly supported, the bundled charger is rated at 10W. The Redmi 7 supports 4G and VoLTE on both SIMs, as well as single-band Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.2, and GPS. There's an electronic compass plus the usual accelerometer and ambient light sensor, but no gyroscope. Our diagnostics showed that this phone supports Widevine L3 DRM, not L1 for full-HD video streaming. The rear dual-camera module on the Redmi 7 sticks out just a tiny bit   Our review unit was running MIUI 10.2 on top of Android 9 Pie. During the initial setup process there's an option to disable “Wallpaper Carousel” stories on the lock screen, which can include some ads and sponsored content. You'll see a different item every time you unlock your phone. Interestingly, this is exactly the same platform we've encountered on Samsung's latest phones. It's powered by a third-party app called Glance. We saw fewer blatant ads and better-designed snippets than we did when reviewing the Samsung Galaxy M20 (Review), but it's still annoying. When disabled, there's a permanent icon on the lock screen leading you to an option to turn it back on. MIUI doesn't give you the option of an app drawer so all icons are on the home screens. If you swipe right from the first home screen, you'll come to a page called App Vault which has various panels including shortcuts to specific tasks within certain apps. There are also ads for “recommended apps”, contests, and app integrations here. The MIUI task switcher has a tiled layout which is actually quite handy. The Second Space feature is a separate profile for private apps and data, which you can delete and reset anytime. Dual Apps lets you run two instances of nearly any app, not just messengers. We noticed that when installing any app from the Google Play store, an “app checker” screen with an ad would pop up. The default Facemoji keyboard offers loads of ASCII text effects, emojis, GIFs, stickers, and themes. There's a Mi Apps store and several first-party apps, and as we've seen before there are ads in many of them.  The Music app lets you stream songs from Hungama without any account setup process. An app called Security has a virus scanner and some privacy tools, but also for some reason includes a “game speed booster” and the battery and storage controls that are usually in the Settings app. Of course there are ads everywhere, including full-screen interstitials. The Redmi 7 packs the traditional Micro-USB port   We received the 3GB RAM version of the Redmi 7 for review, so our experiences might be better than those of people who buy the base variant, which is of course more affordable. Other than the ads throughout MIUI, we found the Redmi 7 easy to use, but a little buggy. There was sometimes very minor lag when calling up and scrolling through the app switcher, most likely due to the thumbnails of all running apps that need to be cached. One rare but odd issue was that notifications would sometimes disappear in less than a second, making them impossible to read.  The screen is a little too reflective, but is decent in terms of quality. With a screen this large, videos and games look great, but text is just a little bit fuzzy. Colours and viewing angles are fine, but sunlight legibility was not very good. We were impressed with the speaker, which can push out loud sound without distortion. It's great for voices in video and music, but of course there isn't much bass or richness to the sound. As is standard for Xiaomi, no headset is included. Our benchmarks showed big performance improvements compared to the Redmi 6 series. AnTuTu gave us 103,574 points and Geekbench's single-core and multi-core scores were 1,247 and 4,333 respectively. The Redmi 7 managed 511 points in 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme test and 14,458 in Ice Storm Unlimited. GFXBench's T-rex and Manhattan 3.1 tests ran at 36fps and 14fps respectively. Asphalt 9: Legends showed up in the Google Play Store as incompatible with this phone, so we couldn't test it. PUBG Mobile ran fine at the Medium preset by default. We did notice the upper back of the phone getting a bit warm after a few rounds. The 4000mAh battery in this phone lasted a very impressive 17 hours, 9 minutes in our HD video loop test. With casual use, including a lot of Web surfing plus a bit of photography, gaming and video streaming, we managed to make it through a full day and still had about 30 percent remaining at night. The Redmi 7 has a 12-megapixel f/2.2 primary rear camera with a 2-megapixel depth sensor. It doesn't have an extra zoom or wide-angle lens, but the app does boast of AI to detect scenes and adjust camera settings automatically. Other than the usual Pro and Portrait modes, there are menus in the photo and video modes with additional options including Tilt-Shift, Beautification, Group Selfie, Time-lapse, and Google Lens. You can take bursts by tapping and holding the shutter button, and there's even a setting to let you choose between average, centre-weighted and spot metering. Tap to see full-sized Redmi 7 camera samples   We liked how our photo samples came out. The shots we took under bright sunlight had sharp focus and subtle details within the focused area, though anything more than a few feet away looked a lot poorer. The Redmi 7 handled exposures well in scenes with bright light as well as shadow, but would have liked a little more vibrancy and punch to the colours. We were pleasantly surprised by how bright low-light shots came out, and even colours were relatively well preserved. However, there was a lot of noise and these photos really didn't look good when we zoomed in. There's also a lot of motion blur and you can expect bright areas to be overexposed thanks to the slow shutter. Videos can be recorded at 1080p 60fps and you can choose between the more widely compatible H.264 and more efficient H.265 codecs. The clips we recorded looked a bit dull and there was a lot of jerkiness. Detail was poor in full-HD videos recorded at night. Beautification is applied automatically when using the 8-megapixel f/2.0 front camera, and it's way too aggressive. VerdictXiaomi has done a lot to improve the Redmi series, and the new Redmi 7 offers better features and specifications as well as more up-to-date looks than the Redmi 6. There are a few steps backwards though – we don't like the reduction in RAM on the base model and lack of a 64GB storage variant. The Redmi Note 7 and Redmi Y3 both start at Rs. 9,999 — Rs. 1,000 more than the top-end Redmi 7 — and it would be very tempting to choose either of those models for the improvements they offer. As for this phone's competition, we have the Realme 3 (Review), Samsung Galaxy M10 (Review), and Asus Zenfone Max M2 (Review) or ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review). Xiaomi does seem to have an advantage in terms of features and specifications overall at its price. However the software experience, particularly all the advertising, is likely to put a lot of people off. Do Redmi 7 and Redmi Y3 prices in India show that Xiaomi's missed a trick?

The only difference is that the base variant priced at Rs. 7,999 has 2GB of RAM, and the Rs. 8,999 variant has 3GB of RAM. That doesn't make a lot of sense to us. If you're willing to pay Rs. 1,000 more, you could buy the Redmi Note 7 (Review) instead. It's also a small step backwards compared to the Redmi 6, which had 3GB of RAM across variants and a choice of 32GB of storage at the same price or 64GB for Rs. 1,500 more. The 6.26-inch screen has a resolution of 720x1520 and an aspect ratio of 19:9. Xiaomi says you get 84 percent of the NTSC colour gamut which is decent enough for a low-cost phone. There's a 4000mAh battery which is a big bump up from 3000mAh on the Redmi 6, and while Qualcomm's Quick Charge isn't explicitly supported, the bundled charger is rated at 10W. The Redmi 7 supports 4G and VoLTE on both SIMs, as well as single-band Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.2, and GPS. There's an electronic compass plus the usual accelerometer and ambient light sensor, but no gyroscope. Our diagnostics showed that this phone supports Widevine L3 DRM, not L1 for full-HD video streaming. The rear dual-camera module on the Redmi 7 sticks out just a tiny bit   Our review unit was running MIUI 10.2 on top of Android 9 Pie. During the initial setup process there's an option to disable “Wallpaper Carousel” stories on the lock screen, which can include some ads and sponsored content. You'll see a different item every time you unlock your phone. Interestingly, this is exactly the same platform we've encountered on Samsung's latest phones. It's powered by a third-party app called Glance. We saw fewer blatant ads and better-designed snippets than we did when reviewing the Samsung Galaxy M20 (Review), but it's still annoying. When disabled, there's a permanent icon on the lock screen leading you to an option to turn it back on. MIUI doesn't give you the option of an app drawer so all icons are on the home screens. If you swipe right from the first home screen, you'll come to a page called App Vault which has various panels including shortcuts to specific tasks within certain apps. There are also ads for “recommended apps”, contests, and app integrations here. The MIUI task switcher has a tiled layout which is actually quite handy. The Second Space feature is a separate profile for private apps and data, which you can delete and reset anytime. Dual Apps lets you run two instances of nearly any app, not just messengers. We noticed that when installing any app from the Google Play store, an “app checker” screen with an ad would pop up. The default Facemoji keyboard offers loads of ASCII text effects, emojis, GIFs, stickers, and themes. There's a Mi Apps store and several first-party apps, and as we've seen before there are ads in many of them.  The Music app lets you stream songs from Hungama without any account setup process. An app called Security has a virus scanner and some privacy tools, but also for some reason includes a “game speed booster” and the battery and storage controls that are usually in the Settings app. Of course there are ads everywhere, including full-screen interstitials. The Redmi 7 packs the traditional Micro-USB port   We received the 3GB RAM version of the Redmi 7 for review, so our experiences might be better than those of people who buy the base variant, which is of course more affordable. Other than the ads throughout MIUI, we found the Redmi 7 easy to use, but a little buggy. There was sometimes very minor lag when calling up and scrolling through the app switcher, most likely due to the thumbnails of all running apps that need to be cached. One rare but odd issue was that notifications would sometimes disappear in less than a second, making them impossible to read.  The screen is a little too reflective, but is decent in terms of quality. With a screen this large, videos and games look great, but text is just a little bit fuzzy. Colours and viewing angles are fine, but sunlight legibility was not very good. We were impressed with the speaker, which can push out loud sound without distortion. It's great for voices in video and music, but of course there isn't much bass or richness to the sound. As is standard for Xiaomi, no headset is included. Our benchmarks showed big performance improvements compared to the Redmi 6 series. AnTuTu gave us 103,574 points and Geekbench's single-core and multi-core scores were 1,247 and 4,333 respectively. The Redmi 7 managed 511 points in 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme test and 14,458 in Ice Storm Unlimited. GFXBench's T-rex and Manhattan 3.1 tests ran at 36fps and 14fps respectively. Asphalt 9: Legends showed up in the Google Play Store as incompatible with this phone, so we couldn't test it. PUBG Mobile ran fine at the Medium preset by default. We did notice the upper back of the phone getting a bit warm after a few rounds. The 4000mAh battery in this phone lasted a very impressive 17 hours, 9 minutes in our HD video loop test. With casual use, including a lot of Web surfing plus a bit of photography, gaming and video streaming, we managed to make it through a full day and still had about 30 percent remaining at night. The Redmi 7 has a 12-megapixel f/2.2 primary rear camera with a 2-megapixel depth sensor. It doesn't have an extra zoom or wide-angle lens, but the app does boast of AI to detect scenes and adjust camera settings automatically. Other than the usual Pro and Portrait modes, there are menus in the photo and video modes with additional options including Tilt-Shift, Beautification, Group Selfie, Time-lapse, and Google Lens. You can take bursts by tapping and holding the shutter button, and there's even a setting to let you choose between average, centre-weighted and spot metering. Tap to see full-sized Redmi 7 camera samples   We liked how our photo samples came out. The shots we took under bright sunlight had sharp focus and subtle details within the focused area, though anything more than a few feet away looked a lot poorer. The Redmi 7 handled exposures well in scenes with bright light as well as shadow, but would have liked a little more vibrancy and punch to the colours. We were pleasantly surprised by how bright low-light shots came out, and even colours were relatively well preserved. However, there was a lot of noise and these photos really didn't look good when we zoomed in. There's also a lot of motion blur and you can expect bright areas to be overexposed thanks to the slow shutter. Videos can be recorded at 1080p 60fps and you can choose between the more widely compatible H.264 and more efficient H.265 codecs. The clips we recorded looked a bit dull and there was a lot of jerkiness. Detail was poor in full-HD videos recorded at night. Beautification is applied automatically when using the 8-megapixel f/2.0 front camera, and it's way too aggressive. VerdictXiaomi has done a lot to improve the Redmi series, and the new Redmi 7 offers better features and specifications as well as more up-to-date looks than the Redmi 6. There are a few steps backwards though – we don't like the reduction in RAM on the base model and lack of a 64GB storage variant. The Redmi Note 7 and Redmi Y3 both start at Rs. 9,999 — Rs. 1,000 more than the top-end Redmi 7 — and it would be very tempting to choose either of those models for the improvements they offer. As for this phone's competition, we have the Realme 3 (Review), Samsung Galaxy M10 (Review), and Asus Zenfone Max M2 (Review) or ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review). Xiaomi does seem to have an advantage in terms of features and specifications overall at its price. However the software experience, particularly all the advertising, is likely to put a lot of people off. Do Redmi 7 and Redmi Y3 prices in India show that Xiaomi's missed a trick?

2499,21,redmi-7-review-xiaomi-india-mi-7-price-2029081,8,10,2019-04-28,2029081,Jamshed Avari,Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/redmi-7-review-xiaomi-india-mi-7-price-2029081," It's been just over seven months since the launch of the Redmi 6 series in India, but in the smartphone world that's a lifetime. New features such as waterdrop notches and gradient designs have become popular, and competitors aren't standing still. Xiaomi isn't the only company constantly fighting to improve specifications and features in low-cost phones. The newly reinvigorated Samsung, in particular, poses a significant threat with its reasonably priced A-series and M-series models, which have been selling quite well since their launch. It's no surprise then that Xiaomi has already refreshed its sub-Rs. 8,000 offering. The newly announced Redmi 7 is a workhorse all-rounder that should appeal to anyone. It seems to offer nearly everything that buyers might want, and the focus is on overall value rather than any one major feature. Interestingly, Xiaomi hasn't launched Redmi 7 Pro or Redmi 7A companion models – not yet at least. In this review, we're focusing on the Redmi 7, and we're going to see whether Xiaomi has managed to deliver enough to stay ahead of Samsung, Honor, Realme, and other competitors.    Many of Xiaomi's previous phones have looked very similar, but the Redmi 7 breaks the mould. The company has completely ditched the metallic look of the Redmi 6 (Review), and has embraced multi-coloured glossy plastic just like many of its competitors have. There are three colours to choose from – the plain Eclipse Black — which we got for review — and the more eye-catching Comet Blue and Lunar Red. The latter two feature colour gradients on their rear panels. Xiaomi calls this its ‘Aura Smoke' look. The Comet Blue option features dark purple merging into bright blue, while Lunar Red is black at the top fading into red on the bottom. While not everyone will love this, the overall effect is a little subtler than some of the other designs we've seen recently. If you don't like these finishes, you can use the dark translucent plastic cover that comes in the box. Phones have been growing bigger, and the Redmi 7 is no exception. Its 6.26 inch screen is much larger than the 5.45-inch one on the Redmi 6, but that isn't just because of slimmer borders. The Redmi 7 is significantly bigger than its predecessor in all dimensions, and heavier too. At 180g and 8.47mm in thickness, this phone is quite a handful, and you'll feel its heft in your pocket when walking around. It also isn't easy to reach all corners of the screen with just the thumb. With this generation, even the low-cost Redmi 7 gets a modern “dot” notch, though we have to say that if you're looking for a borderless screen, this phone doesn't quite fit that description. The good news is that Xiaomi has used Gorilla Glass 5 for the display, which should give you some peace of mind. Redmi 7 sports a modern “dot” notch   The back of this phone is made out moulded plastic, which Xiaomi says has been “finished with a nano-spray”. Our plain black review unit was glossy and highly reflective, and didn't have any noticeable texture. Sadly, it did get very grimy with fingerprints and smudges within moments of us unboxing this phone. We also noticed that dust and tiny fibres tended to stick to the back. It's impossible to keep the Redmi 7 looking fresh which is a pity. We saw major scratches and scuffs after less than a week of careful handling. The edges where the glossy rear panel meets the matte plastic frame aren't perfectly smooth and this phone is somewhat awkward to use. Thankfully the fingerprint sensor on the rear and the power and volume buttons on the right are within easy reach. There's a very slim earpiece right above the front camera notch, and the sensors are hidden. A tiny white LED embedded in the chin below the screen lights up when this phone is charging and goes off when the battery is full. The rear dual-camera module sticks out just a tiny bit and doesn't get in the way of anything. On the top of this phone, you'll find a 3.5mm headset socket and an infrared emitter for controlling appliances with. A single tray on the upper left can hold two Nano-SIMs as well as a microSD card, which is always good to see. Of the two grilles on the bottom, only one is actually a speaker. We would have liked a USB Type-C port, but we can't complain about the use of the Micro-USB standard at this price, and at least a lot of people will be able to recycle old cables. Not everyone will like the plastic body and colourful gradients, or the fact that this phone is rather bulky and unwieldy. If you like bigger phones, you'll find the Redmi 7 much more attractive than its predecessors at the same price. Back of the Redmi 7 is made out moulded plastic   At the heart of the new Redmi 7 is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 SoC which is a considerable improvement over not only the Redmi 6's MediaTek Helio P22, but also the Snapdragon 625 in the Redmi 6 Pro (Review). It has eight of Qualcomm's own Kryo 250 CPU cores running at up to 1.8GHz, and integrated Adreno 506 graphics.

The Redmi 7 has a 12-megapixel f/2.2 primary rear camera with a 2-megapixel depth sensor. It doesn't have an extra zoom or wide-angle lens, but the app does boast of AI to detect scenes and adjust camera settings automatically. Other than the usual Pro and Portrait modes, there are menus in the photo and video modes with additional options including Tilt-Shift, Beautification, Group Selfie, Time-lapse, and Google Lens. You can take bursts by tapping and holding the shutter button, and there's even a setting to let you choose between average, centre-weighted and spot metering. Tap to see full-sized Redmi 7 camera samples   We liked how our photo samples came out. The shots we took under bright sunlight had sharp focus and subtle details within the focused area, though anything more than a few feet away looked a lot poorer. The Redmi 7 handled exposures well in scenes with bright light as well as shadow, but would have liked a little more vibrancy and punch to the colours. We were pleasantly surprised by how bright low-light shots came out, and even colours were relatively well preserved. However, there was a lot of noise and these photos really didn't look good when we zoomed in. There's also a lot of motion blur and you can expect bright areas to be overexposed thanks to the slow shutter. Videos can be recorded at 1080p 60fps and you can choose between the more widely compatible H.264 and more efficient H.265 codecs. The clips we recorded looked a bit dull and there was a lot of jerkiness. Detail was poor in full-HD videos recorded at night. Beautification is applied automatically when using the 8-megapixel f/2.0 front camera, and it's way too aggressive. VerdictXiaomi has done a lot to improve the Redmi series, and the new Redmi 7 offers better features and specifications as well as more up-to-date looks than the Redmi 6. There are a few steps backwards though – we don't like the reduction in RAM on the base model and lack of a 64GB storage variant. The Redmi Note 7 and Redmi Y3 both start at Rs. 9,999 — Rs. 1,000 more than the top-end Redmi 7 — and it would be very tempting to choose either of those models for the improvements they offer. As for this phone's competition, we have the Realme 3 (Review), Samsung Galaxy M10 (Review), and Asus Zenfone Max M2 (Review) or ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review). Xiaomi does seem to have an advantage in terms of features and specifications overall at its price. However the software experience, particularly all the advertising, is likely to put a lot of people off. Do Redmi 7 and Redmi Y3 prices in India show that Xiaomi's missed a trick?

2499,21,redmi-7-review-xiaomi-india-mi-7-price-2029081,8,10,2019-04-28,2029081,Jamshed Avari,Xiaomi Redmi 7 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/redmi-7-review-xiaomi-india-mi-7-price-2029081," It's been just over seven months since the launch of the Redmi 6 series in India, but in the smartphone world that's a lifetime. New features such as waterdrop notches and gradient designs have become popular, and competitors aren't standing still. Xiaomi isn't the only company constantly fighting to improve specifications and features in low-cost phones. The newly reinvigorated Samsung, in particular, poses a significant threat with its reasonably priced A-series and M-series models, which have been selling quite well since their launch. It's no surprise then that Xiaomi has already refreshed its sub-Rs. 8,000 offering. The newly announced Redmi 7 is a workhorse all-rounder that should appeal to anyone. It seems to offer nearly everything that buyers might want, and the focus is on overall value rather than any one major feature. Interestingly, Xiaomi hasn't launched Redmi 7 Pro or Redmi 7A companion models – not yet at least. In this review, we're focusing on the Redmi 7, and we're going to see whether Xiaomi has managed to deliver enough to stay ahead of Samsung, Honor, Realme, and other competitors.    Many of Xiaomi's previous phones have looked very similar, but the Redmi 7 breaks the mould. The company has completely ditched the metallic look of the Redmi 6 (Review), and has embraced multi-coloured glossy plastic just like many of its competitors have. There are three colours to choose from – the plain Eclipse Black — which we got for review — and the more eye-catching Comet Blue and Lunar Red. The latter two feature colour gradients on their rear panels. Xiaomi calls this its ‘Aura Smoke' look. The Comet Blue option features dark purple merging into bright blue, while Lunar Red is black at the top fading into red on the bottom. While not everyone will love this, the overall effect is a little subtler than some of the other designs we've seen recently. If you don't like these finishes, you can use the dark translucent plastic cover that comes in the box. Phones have been growing bigger, and the Redmi 7 is no exception. Its 6.26 inch screen is much larger than the 5.45-inch one on the Redmi 6, but that isn't just because of slimmer borders. The Redmi 7 is significantly bigger than its predecessor in all dimensions, and heavier too. At 180g and 8.47mm in thickness, this phone is quite a handful, and you'll feel its heft in your pocket when walking around. It also isn't easy to reach all corners of the screen with just the thumb. With this generation, even the low-cost Redmi 7 gets a modern “dot” notch, though we have to say that if you're looking for a borderless screen, this phone doesn't quite fit that description. The good news is that Xiaomi has used Gorilla Glass 5 for the display, which should give you some peace of mind. Redmi 7 sports a modern “dot” notch   The back of this phone is made out moulded plastic, which Xiaomi says has been “finished with a nano-spray”. Our plain black review unit was glossy and highly reflective, and didn't have any noticeable texture. Sadly, it did get very grimy with fingerprints and smudges within moments of us unboxing this phone. We also noticed that dust and tiny fibres tended to stick to the back. It's impossible to keep the Redmi 7 looking fresh which is a pity. We saw major scratches and scuffs after less than a week of careful handling. The edges where the glossy rear panel meets the matte plastic frame aren't perfectly smooth and this phone is somewhat awkward to use. Thankfully the fingerprint sensor on the rear and the power and volume buttons on the right are within easy reach. There's a very slim earpiece right above the front camera notch, and the sensors are hidden. A tiny white LED embedded in the chin below the screen lights up when this phone is charging and goes off when the battery is full. The rear dual-camera module sticks out just a tiny bit and doesn't get in the way of anything. On the top of this phone, you'll find a 3.5mm headset socket and an infrared emitter for controlling appliances with. A single tray on the upper left can hold two Nano-SIMs as well as a microSD card, which is always good to see. Of the two grilles on the bottom, only one is actually a speaker. We would have liked a USB Type-C port, but we can't complain about the use of the Micro-USB standard at this price, and at least a lot of people will be able to recycle old cables. Not everyone will like the plastic body and colourful gradients, or the fact that this phone is rather bulky and unwieldy. If you like bigger phones, you'll find the Redmi 7 much more attractive than its predecessors at the same price. Back of the Redmi 7 is made out moulded plastic   At the heart of the new Redmi 7 is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 SoC which is a considerable improvement over not only the Redmi 6's MediaTek Helio P22, but also the Snapdragon 625 in the Redmi 6 Pro (Review). It has eight of Qualcomm's own Kryo 250 CPU cores running at up to 1.8GHz, and integrated Adreno 506 graphics. Xiaomi has launched two variants of the Redmi 7 in India, and both have 32GB of eMMC storage. The only difference is that the base variant priced at Rs. 7,999 has 2GB of RAM, and the Rs. 8,999 variant has 3GB of RAM. That doesn't make a lot of sense to us. If you're willing to pay Rs. 1,000 more, you could buy the Redmi Note 7 (Review) instead. It's also a small step backwards compared to the Redmi 6, which had 3GB of RAM across variants and a choice of 32GB of storage at the same price or 64GB for Rs. 1,500 more. The 6.26-inch screen has a resolution of 720x1520 and an aspect ratio of 19:9. Xiaomi says you get 84 percent of the NTSC colour gamut which is decent enough for a low-cost phone. There's a 4000mAh battery which is a big bump up from 3000mAh on the Redmi 6, and while Qualcomm's Quick Charge isn't explicitly supported, the bundled charger is rated at 10W. The Redmi 7 supports 4G and VoLTE on both SIMs, as well as single-band Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.2, and GPS. There's an electronic compass plus the usual accelerometer and ambient light sensor, but no gyroscope. Our diagnostics showed that this phone supports Widevine L3 DRM, not L1 for full-HD video streaming. The rear dual-camera module on the Redmi 7 sticks out just a tiny bit   Our review unit was running MIUI 10.2 on top of Android 9 Pie. During the initial setup process there's an option to disable “Wallpaper Carousel” stories on the lock screen, which can include some ads and sponsored content. You'll see a different item every time you unlock your phone. Interestingly, this is exactly the same platform we've encountered on Samsung's latest phones. It's powered by a third-party app called Glance. We saw fewer blatant ads and better-designed snippets than we did when reviewing the Samsung Galaxy M20 (Review), but it's still annoying. When disabled, there's a permanent icon on the lock screen leading you to an option to turn it back on. MIUI doesn't give you the option of an app drawer so all icons are on the home screens. If you swipe right from the first home screen, you'll come to a page called App Vault which has various panels including shortcuts to specific tasks within certain apps. There are also ads for “recommended apps”, contests, and app integrations here. The MIUI task switcher has a tiled layout which is actually quite handy. The Second Space feature is a separate profile for private apps and data, which you can delete and reset anytime. Dual Apps lets you run two instances of nearly any app, not just messengers. We noticed that when installing any app from the Google Play store, an “app checker” screen with an ad would pop up. The default Facemoji keyboard offers loads of ASCII text effects, emojis, GIFs, stickers, and themes. There's a Mi Apps store and several first-party apps, and as we've seen before there are ads in many of them.  The Music app lets you stream songs from Hungama without any account setup process. An app called Security has a virus scanner and some privacy tools, but also for some reason includes a “game speed booster” and the battery and storage controls that are usually in the Settings app. Of course there are ads everywhere, including full-screen interstitials. The Redmi 7 packs the traditional Micro-USB port   We received the 3GB RAM version of the Redmi 7 for review, so our experiences might be better than those of people who buy the base variant, which is of course more affordable. Other than the ads throughout MIUI, we found the Redmi 7 easy to use, but a little buggy. There was sometimes very minor lag when calling up and scrolling through the app switcher, most likely due to the thumbnails of all running apps that need to be cached. One rare but odd issue was that notifications would sometimes disappear in less than a second, making them impossible to read.  The screen is a little too reflective, but is decent in terms of quality. With a screen this large, videos and games look great, but text is just a little bit fuzzy. Colours and viewing angles are fine, but sunlight legibility was not very good. We were impressed with the speaker, which can push out loud sound without distortion. It's great for voices in video and music, but of course there isn't much bass or richness to the sound. As is standard for Xiaomi, no headset is included. Our benchmarks showed big performance improvements compared to the Redmi 6 series. AnTuTu gave us 103,574 points and Geekbench's single-core and multi-core scores were 1,247 and 4,333 respectively. The Redmi 7 managed 511 points in 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme test and 14,458 in Ice Storm Unlimited. GFXBench's T-rex and Manhattan 3.1 tests ran at 36fps and 14fps respectively. Asphalt 9: Legends showed up in the Google Play Store as incompatible with this phone, so we couldn't test it. PUBG Mobile ran fine at the Medium preset by default. We did notice the upper back of the phone getting a bit warm after a few rounds. The 4000mAh battery in this phone lasted a very impressive 17 hours, 9 minutes in our HD video loop test. With casual use, including a lot of Web surfing plus a bit of photography, gaming and video streaming, we managed to make it through a full day and still had about 30 percent remaining at night.

The Redmi 7 is significantly bigger than its predecessor in all dimensions, and heavier too. At 180g and 8.47mm in thickness, this phone is quite a handful, and you'll feel its heft in your pocket when walking around. It also isn't easy to reach all corners of the screen with just the thumb. With this generation, even the low-cost Redmi 7 gets a modern “dot” notch, though we have to say that if you're looking for a borderless screen, this phone doesn't quite fit that description. The good news is that Xiaomi has used Gorilla Glass 5 for the display, which should give you some peace of mind. Redmi 7 sports a modern “dot” notch   The back of this phone is made out moulded plastic, which Xiaomi says has been “finished with a nano-spray”. Our plain black review unit was glossy and highly reflective, and didn't have any noticeable texture. Sadly, it did get very grimy with fingerprints and smudges within moments of us unboxing this phone. We also noticed that dust and tiny fibres tended to stick to the back. It's impossible to keep the Redmi 7 looking fresh which is a pity. We saw major scratches and scuffs after less than a week of careful handling. The edges where the glossy rear panel meets the matte plastic frame aren't perfectly smooth and this phone is somewhat awkward to use. Thankfully the fingerprint sensor on the rear and the power and volume buttons on the right are within easy reach. There's a very slim earpiece right above the front camera notch, and the sensors are hidden. A tiny white LED embedded in the chin below the screen lights up when this phone is charging and goes off when the battery is full. The rear dual-camera module sticks out just a tiny bit and doesn't get in the way of anything. On the top of this phone, you'll find a 3.5mm headset socket and an infrared emitter for controlling appliances with. A single tray on the upper left can hold two Nano-SIMs as well as a microSD card, which is always good to see. Of the two grilles on the bottom, only one is actually a speaker. We would have liked a USB Type-C port, but we can't complain about the use of the Micro-USB standard at this price, and at least a lot of people will be able to recycle old cables. Not everyone will like the plastic body and colourful gradients, or the fact that this phone is rather bulky and unwieldy. If you like bigger phones, you'll find the Redmi 7 much more attractive than its predecessors at the same price. Back of the Redmi 7 is made out moulded plastic   At the heart of the new Redmi 7 is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 SoC which is a considerable improvement over not only the Redmi 6's MediaTek Helio P22, but also the Snapdragon 625 in the Redmi 6 Pro (Review). It has eight of Qualcomm's own Kryo 250 CPU cores running at up to 1.8GHz, and integrated Adreno 506 graphics. Xiaomi has launched two variants of the Redmi 7 in India, and both have 32GB of eMMC storage. The only difference is that the base variant priced at Rs. 7,999 has 2GB of RAM, and the Rs. 8,999 variant has 3GB of RAM. That doesn't make a lot of sense to us. If you're willing to pay Rs. 1,000 more, you could buy the Redmi Note 7 (Review) instead. It's also a small step backwards compared to the Redmi 6, which had 3GB of RAM across variants and a choice of 32GB of storage at the same price or 64GB for Rs. 1,500 more. The 6.26-inch screen has a resolution of 720x1520 and an aspect ratio of 19:9. Xiaomi says you get 84 percent of the NTSC colour gamut which is decent enough for a low-cost phone. There's a 4000mAh battery which is a big bump up from 3000mAh on the Redmi 6, and while Qualcomm's Quick Charge isn't explicitly supported, the bundled charger is rated at 10W. The Redmi 7 supports 4G and VoLTE on both SIMs, as well as single-band Wi-Fi 802.11n, Bluetooth 4.2, and GPS. There's an electronic compass plus the usual accelerometer and ambient light sensor, but no gyroscope. Our diagnostics showed that this phone supports Widevine L3 DRM, not L1 for full-HD video streaming. The rear dual-camera module on the Redmi 7 sticks out just a tiny bit   Our review unit was running MIUI 10.2 on top of Android 9 Pie. During the initial setup process there's an option to disable “Wallpaper Carousel” stories on the lock screen, which can include some ads and sponsored content. You'll see a different item every time you unlock your phone. Interestingly, this is exactly the same platform we've encountered on Samsung's latest phones. It's powered by a third-party app called Glance. We saw fewer blatant ads and better-designed snippets than we did when reviewing the Samsung Galaxy M20 (Review), but it's still annoying. When disabled, there's a permanent icon on the lock screen leading you to an option to turn it back on. MIUI doesn't give you the option of an app drawer so all icons are on the home screens. If you swipe right from the first home screen, you'll come to a page called App Vault which has various panels including shortcuts to specific tasks within certain apps. There are also ads for “recommended apps”, contests, and app integrations here. The MIUI task switcher has a tiled layout which is actually quite handy. The Second Space feature is a separate profile for private apps and data, which you can delete and reset anytime. Dual Apps lets you run two instances of nearly any app, not just messengers. We noticed that when installing any app from the Google Play store, an “app checker” screen with an ad would pop up. The default Facemoji keyboard offers loads of ASCII text effects, emojis, GIFs, stickers, and themes. There's a Mi Apps store and several first-party apps, and as we've seen before there are ads in many of them.  The Music app lets you stream songs from Hungama without any account setup process. An app called Security has a virus scanner and some privacy tools, but also for some reason includes a “game speed booster” and the battery and storage controls that are usually in the Settings app. Of course there are ads everywhere, including full-screen interstitials. The Redmi 7 packs the traditional Micro-USB port   We received the 3GB RAM version of the Redmi 7 for review, so our experiences might be better than those of people who buy the base variant, which is of course more affordable. Other than the ads throughout MIUI, we found the Redmi 7 easy to use, but a little buggy. There was sometimes very minor lag when calling up and scrolling through the app switcher, most likely due to the thumbnails of all running apps that need to be cached. One rare but odd issue was that notifications would sometimes disappear in less than a second, making them impossible to read.  The screen is a little too reflective, but is decent in terms of quality. With a screen this large, videos and games look great, but text is just a little bit fuzzy. Colours and viewing angles are fine, but sunlight legibility was not very good. We were impressed with the speaker, which can push out loud sound without distortion. It's great for voices in video and music, but of course there isn't much bass or richness to the sound. As is standard for Xiaomi, no headset is included. Our benchmarks showed big performance improvements compared to the Redmi 6 series. AnTuTu gave us 103,574 points and Geekbench's single-core and multi-core scores were 1,247 and 4,333 respectively. The Redmi 7 managed 511 points in 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme test and 14,458 in Ice Storm Unlimited. GFXBench's T-rex and Manhattan 3.1 tests ran at 36fps and 14fps respectively. Asphalt 9: Legends showed up in the Google Play Store as incompatible with this phone, so we couldn't test it. PUBG Mobile ran fine at the Medium preset by default. We did notice the upper back of the phone getting a bit warm after a few rounds. The 4000mAh battery in this phone lasted a very impressive 17 hours, 9 minutes in our HD video loop test. With casual use, including a lot of Web surfing plus a bit of photography, gaming and video streaming, we managed to make it through a full day and still had about 30 percent remaining at night. The Redmi 7 has a 12-megapixel f/2.2 primary rear camera with a 2-megapixel depth sensor. It doesn't have an extra zoom or wide-angle lens, but the app does boast of AI to detect scenes and adjust camera settings automatically. Other than the usual Pro and Portrait modes, there are menus in the photo and video modes with additional options including Tilt-Shift, Beautification, Group Selfie, Time-lapse, and Google Lens. You can take bursts by tapping and holding the shutter button, and there's even a setting to let you choose between average, centre-weighted and spot metering. Tap to see full-sized Redmi 7 camera samples   We liked how our photo samples came out. The shots we took under bright sunlight had sharp focus and subtle details within the focused area, though anything more than a few feet away looked a lot poorer. The Redmi 7 handled exposures well in scenes with bright light as well as shadow, but would have liked a little more vibrancy and punch to the colours. We were pleasantly surprised by how bright low-light shots came out, and even colours were relatively well preserved. However, there was a lot of noise and these photos really didn't look good when we zoomed in. There's also a lot of motion blur and you can expect bright areas to be overexposed thanks to the slow shutter. Videos can be recorded at 1080p 60fps and you can choose between the more widely compatible H.264 and more efficient H.265 codecs. The clips we recorded looked a bit dull and there was a lot of jerkiness. Detail was poor in full-HD videos recorded at night. Beautification is applied automatically when using the 8-megapixel f/2.0 front camera, and it's way too aggressive. VerdictXiaomi has done a lot to improve the Redmi series, and the new Redmi 7 offers better features and specifications as well as more up-to-date looks than the Redmi 6. There are a few steps backwards though – we don't like the reduction in RAM on the base model and lack of a 64GB storage variant. The Redmi Note 7 and Redmi Y3 both start at Rs. 9,999 — Rs. 1,000 more than the top-end Redmi 7 — and it would be very tempting to choose either of those models for the improvements they offer. As for this phone's competition, we have the Realme 3 (Review), Samsung Galaxy M10 (Review), and Asus Zenfone Max M2 (Review) or ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review). Xiaomi does seem to have an advantage in terms of features and specifications overall at its price. However the software experience, particularly all the advertising, is likely to put a lot of people off. Do Redmi 7 and Redmi Y3 prices in India show that Xiaomi's missed a trick?

2235,21,redmi-note-5-pro-review-1812789,9,10,2018-02-16,1812789,Roydon Cerejo,Redmi Note 5 Pro Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/redmi-note-5-pro-review-1812789," Many Android flagships in 2017 boasted of taller screens with nearly no borders as their headlining feature. Naturally, we started seeing this trend trickle down to the mid-range and entry-level segments, with phones like the InFocus Vision 3 (Review) and Honor 9 Lite (Review) to name a few. Xiaomi has been a favourite in the budget space and now it's joining the party. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Review) has been the ranked as the top selling smartphone in 2017, so expectations for the Chinese manufacturer’s brand new offerings for 2018 are incredibly high. The new Redmi Note 5 (Review) has big shoes to fill and from what we’ve seen, it manages to do so pretty well. Xiaomi has also launched a more powerful model with a better camera, and it's called the Redmi Note 5 Pro. This is the first phone to debut Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 636 mobile platform, which supports full-HD+ displays and features Qualcomm's own custom Kryo CPU cores. While all of this sounds great on paper, the big question is whether it’s worth the premium over the standard Redmi Note 5. Let’s find out.    From the front, the Redmi Note 5 Pro looks very similar to the Redmi Note 5, with the same prominent curved corners on the 18:9 display. The phone still has visible borders to the left and right of the display and comparatively thicker ones at the top and bottom. It does feel slightly heavy at 181g, which could be due to the metal back and large battery. The white and gold trim of our review unit looked good, but you can also get this phone in black, blue, or rose gold. The 5.99-inch display has a full-HD+ resolution, which is wider than what standard full-HD displays offer. Xiaomi boasts of it having a maximum brightness of 450 nits, which means that in the real world, the display is easily legible even under direct sunlight. Gorilla Glass has been used for scratch protection. There aren’t any capacitive buttons here since Xiaomi has gone with on-screen navigation buttons. Above the screen, we have the front facing camera, a diffused selfie flash, the earpiece, and sensors.    The volume and power buttons are on the right of the phone, and are slightly out of reach when you’re holding the phone normally, but feel solid. Up top, there's an IR emitter just like on previous Redmi Note smartphones. At the bottom of the phone, we have a 3.5mm headphone socket, microphone, Micro-USB port, and a speaker grille. Once again, It’s a bit disappointing to not have a Type-C port. Considering that this is the ‘Pro’ model, we would have appreciated the newer connector. On the left, we have a hybrid dual-SIM slot which can accommodate two Nano-SIMs or a microSD card (up to 128GB) in the second slot. The metal back reminds us a lot of the Redmi Note 4, with its matte finish and slightly tapering edges. The fingerprint sensor lines up comfortably against your finger when you hold the phone, and authentication is quick. The camera bump is very noticeable, and let’s face it, its design has been, shall we say, ""heavily inspired"" by the iPhone X (Review). Even the arrangement is the same, with the two camera sensors flanking the dual-LED flash. The bump also means that this phone rests at an awkward angle when you place it on a flat surface. The back is otherwise plain, save for a printed Mi logo towards the bottom.    We received our test unit without any packaging but Xiaomi told us that buyers can expect a bundle similar to that of the Redmi Note 5, including the standard charger and silicone case. The phone is pretty tall, which makes it a challenge to fit snugly into the pockets of some pants, but that isn't much of an issue otherwise. On the other hand, the width is manageable, making this phone easy to grip with one hand. We also got used to the slightly heavier weight after a couple days of using it. Overall, the Redmi Note 5 Pro is built well and looks good. Xiaomi is hailing the Redmi Note 5 Pro as the spiritual successor to the Redmi Note 3 (Review), which is true from a performance standpoint. The Redmi Note 3 raised the bar for performance at the Rs. 15,000 price level, and the Redmi Note 5 raises it once again. This is the first phone to use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 636 mobile platform, which was announced last October. This is only the second SoC outside the Qualcomm's flagship 800 series to feature the company's own custom Kryo CPU cores. We have a total of eight Kryo 260 cores which can run at a maximum clock speed of 1.8GHz and are split into two clusters of four ‘performance’ cores and four ‘efficiency’ cores. Just like the Snapdragon 630 SoC on the Moto X4 (Review), this one is fabricated using the smaller 14nm process, but with a slightly faster Adreno 509 GPU. Qualcomm says this new GPU should offer better gaming performance compared to the Adreno 508 in the Snapdragon 630. Our review unit came running a beta build of Xiaomi's MIUI software, on which most benchmarks didn't run, in order to prevent leaks before launch. However, we did manage to run AnTuTu, which gave us a score of 85,838 points, and PCMark Work 2.0, which gave us a score of 5,619. This is a performance jump of around 10 precent on average compared to the Snapdragon 625 SoC used by the Redmi Note 5.    The Redmi Note 5 Pro is available with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM, although the storage remains the same at 64GB in both variants. You can expand by up to 128GB this using a miroSD card. The phone also has Bluetooth 5, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, GPS, FM radio, USB-OTG, and an array of sensors including a gyroscope. 4G is supported with VoLTE. This phone's MIUI software is still based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, which is a bit disappointing to see and we don't have any official word on when we can expect an Oreo update as of now. The Android security level is also not up to date -  our unit was patched till December 2017, though this could also be due to it being a beta build so we'll give Xiaomi the benefit of the doubt. The custom skin is similar to what we’ve seen on other recent Xiaomi offerings such as the Redmi 5A (Review) and Redmi Y1 (Review). The custom icon set looks polished and we like the use of pastel shades. The interface looks slick and swiping through home screens is smooth. We didn’t encounter any noticeable lag or stutter in the animations either. The leftmost home screen is dedicated to giving you card-style updates, shortcuts for apps (you can add your own too), a space to take quick notes, cricket scores, and calendar events. There's also integration with Ola which lets you tap shortcuts for your Home and Work locations, although you're redirected to the Ola app (or a Web page if you don't have it installed) to actually make bookings. The Redmi Note 5 Pro also has a bunch of pre-installed apps from Xiaomi. Mi Drop lets you send files over an ad-hoc Wi-Fi network provided the receiver also has the app installed. There’s also Mi Store and Mi Community, which can be uninstalled if not wanted.    The Settings app has a submenu for Wi-Fi calling, but there were no options to set, only a message that the feature depends on the cellular network provider. You can change the UI theme, use the fingerprint sensor to lock apps or take pictures, and set shortcuts for launching the flashlight, camera, etc. There are also familiar MIUI features such as Quick Ball, which is like Apple’s AssistiveTouch shortcut panel; one-handed mode; and Dual Apps, which lets you create two instances of some apps so that you can use them with multiple accounts. The Fullscreen Mode menu lets you force apps to run full-screen (minus black bars on the sides), and you can set the navigation bar to auto-hide for a more immersive experience. You can also optionally sign up for a Mi Cloud account, which gives you 5GB of free cloud storage for backing up your contacts, messages, calendars, notes, etc. We tested the 4GB RAM variant of the Redmi Note 5 Pro, which performed very well with day-to-day usage. The screen does attract some fingerprints but we found the rest of the body to be quite resilient to smudges and dirt. Call reception is good and the speaker is loud enough for alerts and some media playback. The phone also runs pretty cool, and even with gaming, it only gets a bit warm. Heavy camera usage doesn’t make it overheat, which is very good. For media playback, Xiaomi offers its own music and video app, which is frankly not needed when you have Google’s suite of media players preinstalled, and more feature-rich options such as MX Player available for free. High-bitrate videos played just fine, and this phone can even handle 4K playback. There’s a system-wide audio enhancement feature for headphones, which can be activated from the Settings app. Audio quality through headphones is good, and you can toggle between presets tuned to Xiaomi's various headphones, or set your own. Xiaomi says the cameras are one of the big highlights of the Redmi Note 5 Pro, and in our experience, they were pretty good. At the back of the phone, there's a primary 12-megapixel camera with 1.25 micron pixels on its sensor and a f/2.2 aperture, while the second 5-megapixel camera is only used for sensing depth for the Portrait Mode effect. This works decently well for human subjects but the edge detection isn’t always accurate for other objects. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro camera samples   Landscapes shot in daylight have good detail, with very good colours. The phone struggles to get the white balance right at times under harsh sunlight, but otherwise, light metering is handled well. Edges in close-ups aren't very sharp but this is only noticeable when zoomed in at 100 percent. Sadly, HDR doesn’t kick in automatically (it does so with the front camera) so you’ll have to remember to engage it manually. In low light, autofocus gets a bit slower and shutter lag does creep in, but image quality doesn’t degrade too badly. Landscapes have a decent level of detail and noise is kept within bounds, and in macros, colours are well represented. Portrait Mode also works well in low light. Since we tested this phone with beta firmware, the option for 4K video recording wasn't shown. We did check with Xiaomi about this and the company said that 4K video recording is meant to be supported, but an update might not be released by the time this phone goes on sale. Still, 1080p video recorded under good light is impressive. You can enable electronic stabilisation, which causes minor ‘shimmering’ anomalies in the output but this is something that might be fixed with future updates. The stabilisation itself works very well, even when you’re moving about. However, continuous autofocus wasn't very effective when recording video. When switched off, autofocus was more on point. There are also slow-motion and time-lapse video modes, which work well enough. The Short Video shooting mode records a 10-second video clip but the audio quality is quite poor. Panorama mode also works well and is quick in stitching frames together. Manual mode offers limited functionality as it only lets you change the white balance and ISO. Selfie shot on Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro using Depth Mode (tap for full-sized sample)    The front 20-megapixel sensor captures detailed selfies in daylight, although HDR isn’t too effective under strong sunlight. There’s a Depth Mode which uses Xiaomi’s AI learning algorithms for edge detection. In practice, it works quite well. It managed to blur out most of the background of our test shots (with a few misses here and there). There’s a selfie light, which fires diffused white light on your face, helping in very low light. Beautification can be turned on if needed, and you can choose the level of the effect and also modify some of your facial features. The 4000mAh battery in the Redmi Note 5 Pro easily lasted us through more than a day of medium to heavy usage. The bundled 10W charger doesn’t support quick charging but the phone itself does. We tried it with our own Qualcomm Quick Charge power adapter and a notification on the lock screen indicated that the phone was charging quickly. The charging icon in the status bar also changed to the Quick Charge logo. In our HD video loop test, we managed to get 16 hours and 36 minutes of continuous video playback on a single charge.  VerdictThe Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro offers plenty of reasons to spend that extra bit of money over the Redmi Note 5. The list of improvements includes a better set of cameras, slightly better battery life, and a more powerful processor - all of which make the usage experience just a bit nicer. The weight of the phone is something you will have to get used to, and even though it isn’t very striking to look at, the build quality is solid. We love the new taller display, which is sharp and has very good sunlight legibility. Portrait mode works very well for the front and rear cameras, and this is backed by solid battery life and very good overall app and system performance. Given that this is a ‘Pro’ model, we would have liked to see more features, such as a bundled fast charger, USB Type-C port, and maybe a more distinctive design which would have set this phone apart from the non-Pro model. Having Android Oreo out-of-the-box would have also been a nice touch for enthusiasts, who Xiaomi is targeting here. At a starting price of Rs. 13,999, this phone is pretty hard to beat. You have Xiaomi’s own Mi A1 (Review) at the same price, which is also a good pick especially if you’re looking for stock Android interface like on the Google Pixel series. The Moto G5S Plus (Review) has long been one of our top picks at this price point, but now, there’s really no matching the Redmi Note 5 Pro in terms of performance and features at this price.

We didn’t encounter any noticeable lag or stutter in the animations either. The leftmost home screen is dedicated to giving you card-style updates, shortcuts for apps (you can add your own too), a space to take quick notes, cricket scores, and calendar events. There's also integration with Ola which lets you tap shortcuts for your Home and Work locations, although you're redirected to the Ola app (or a Web page if you don't have it installed) to actually make bookings. The Redmi Note 5 Pro also has a bunch of pre-installed apps from Xiaomi. Mi Drop lets you send files over an ad-hoc Wi-Fi network provided the receiver also has the app installed. There’s also Mi Store and Mi Community, which can be uninstalled if not wanted.    The Settings app has a submenu for Wi-Fi calling, but there were no options to set, only a message that the feature depends on the cellular network provider. You can change the UI theme, use the fingerprint sensor to lock apps or take pictures, and set shortcuts for launching the flashlight, camera, etc. There are also familiar MIUI features such as Quick Ball, which is like Apple’s AssistiveTouch shortcut panel; one-handed mode; and Dual Apps, which lets you create two instances of some apps so that you can use them with multiple accounts. The Fullscreen Mode menu lets you force apps to run full-screen (minus black bars on the sides), and you can set the navigation bar to auto-hide for a more immersive experience. You can also optionally sign up for a Mi Cloud account, which gives you 5GB of free cloud storage for backing up your contacts, messages, calendars, notes, etc. We tested the 4GB RAM variant of the Redmi Note 5 Pro, which performed very well with day-to-day usage. The screen does attract some fingerprints but we found the rest of the body to be quite resilient to smudges and dirt. Call reception is good and the speaker is loud enough for alerts and some media playback. The phone also runs pretty cool, and even with gaming, it only gets a bit warm. Heavy camera usage doesn’t make it overheat, which is very good. For media playback, Xiaomi offers its own music and video app, which is frankly not needed when you have Google’s suite of media players preinstalled, and more feature-rich options such as MX Player available for free. High-bitrate videos played just fine, and this phone can even handle 4K playback. There’s a system-wide audio enhancement feature for headphones, which can be activated from the Settings app. Audio quality through headphones is good, and you can toggle between presets tuned to Xiaomi's various headphones, or set your own. Xiaomi says the cameras are one of the big highlights of the Redmi Note 5 Pro, and in our experience, they were pretty good. At the back of the phone, there's a primary 12-megapixel camera with 1.25 micron pixels on its sensor and a f/2.2 aperture, while the second 5-megapixel camera is only used for sensing depth for the Portrait Mode effect. This works decently well for human subjects but the edge detection isn’t always accurate for other objects. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro camera samples   Landscapes shot in daylight have good detail, with very good colours. The phone struggles to get the white balance right at times under harsh sunlight, but otherwise, light metering is handled well. Edges in close-ups aren't very sharp but this is only noticeable when zoomed in at 100 percent. Sadly, HDR doesn’t kick in automatically (it does so with the front camera) so you’ll have to remember to engage it manually. In low light, autofocus gets a bit slower and shutter lag does creep in, but image quality doesn’t degrade too badly. Landscapes have a decent level of detail and noise is kept within bounds, and in macros, colours are well represented. Portrait Mode also works well in low light. Since we tested this phone with beta firmware, the option for 4K video recording wasn't shown. We did check with Xiaomi about this and the company said that 4K video recording is meant to be supported, but an update might not be released by the time this phone goes on sale. Still, 1080p video recorded under good light is impressive. You can enable electronic stabilisation, which causes minor ‘shimmering’ anomalies in the output but this is something that might be fixed with future updates. The stabilisation itself works very well, even when you’re moving about. However, continuous autofocus wasn't very effective when recording video. When switched off, autofocus was more on point. There are also slow-motion and time-lapse video modes, which work well enough. The Short Video shooting mode records a 10-second video clip but the audio quality is quite poor. Panorama mode also works well and is quick in stitching frames together. Manual mode offers limited functionality as it only lets you change the white balance and ISO. Selfie shot on Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro using Depth Mode (tap for full-sized sample)    The front 20-megapixel sensor captures detailed selfies in daylight, although HDR isn’t too effective under strong sunlight. There’s a Depth Mode which uses Xiaomi’s AI learning algorithms for edge detection. In practice, it works quite well. It managed to blur out most of the background of our test shots (with a few misses here and there). There’s a selfie light, which fires diffused white light on your face, helping in very low light. Beautification can be turned on if needed, and you can choose the level of the effect and also modify some of your facial features. The 4000mAh battery in the Redmi Note 5 Pro easily lasted us through more than a day of medium to heavy usage. The bundled 10W charger doesn’t support quick charging but the phone itself does. We tried it with our own Qualcomm Quick Charge power adapter and a notification on the lock screen indicated that the phone was charging quickly. The charging icon in the status bar also changed to the Quick Charge logo. In our HD video loop test, we managed to get 16 hours and 36 minutes of continuous video playback on a single charge.  VerdictThe Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro offers plenty of reasons to spend that extra bit of money over the Redmi Note 5. The list of improvements includes a better set of cameras, slightly better battery life, and a more powerful processor - all of which make the usage experience just a bit nicer. The weight of the phone is something you will have to get used to, and even though it isn’t very striking to look at, the build quality is solid. We love the new taller display, which is sharp and has very good sunlight legibility. Portrait mode works very well for the front and rear cameras, and this is backed by solid battery life and very good overall app and system performance. Given that this is a ‘Pro’ model, we would have liked to see more features, such as a bundled fast charger, USB Type-C port, and maybe a more distinctive design which would have set this phone apart from the non-Pro model. Having Android Oreo out-of-the-box would have also been a nice touch for enthusiasts, who Xiaomi is targeting here. At a starting price of Rs. 13,999, this phone is pretty hard to beat. You have Xiaomi’s own Mi A1 (Review) at the same price, which is also a good pick especially if you’re looking for stock Android interface like on the Google Pixel series. The Moto G5S Plus (Review) has long been one of our top picks at this price point, but now, there’s really no matching the Redmi Note 5 Pro in terms of performance and features at this price.

2235,21,redmi-note-5-pro-review-1812789,9,10,2018-02-16,1812789,Roydon Cerejo,Redmi Note 5 Pro Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/redmi-note-5-pro-review-1812789," Many Android flagships in 2017 boasted of taller screens with nearly no borders as their headlining feature. Naturally, we started seeing this trend trickle down to the mid-range and entry-level segments, with phones like the InFocus Vision 3 (Review) and Honor 9 Lite (Review) to name a few. Xiaomi has been a favourite in the budget space and now it's joining the party. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Review) has been the ranked as the top selling smartphone in 2017, so expectations for the Chinese manufacturer’s brand new offerings for 2018 are incredibly high. The new Redmi Note 5 (Review) has big shoes to fill and from what we’ve seen, it manages to do so pretty well. Xiaomi has also launched a more powerful model with a better camera, and it's called the Redmi Note 5 Pro. This is the first phone to debut Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 636 mobile platform, which supports full-HD+ displays and features Qualcomm's own custom Kryo CPU cores. While all of this sounds great on paper, the big question is whether it’s worth the premium over the standard Redmi Note 5. Let’s find out.    From the front, the Redmi Note 5 Pro looks very similar to the Redmi Note 5, with the same prominent curved corners on the 18:9 display. The phone still has visible borders to the left and right of the display and comparatively thicker ones at the top and bottom. It does feel slightly heavy at 181g, which could be due to the metal back and large battery. The white and gold trim of our review unit looked good, but you can also get this phone in black, blue, or rose gold. The 5.99-inch display has a full-HD+ resolution, which is wider than what standard full-HD displays offer. Xiaomi boasts of it having a maximum brightness of 450 nits, which means that in the real world, the display is easily legible even under direct sunlight. Gorilla Glass has been used for scratch protection. There aren’t any capacitive buttons here since Xiaomi has gone with on-screen navigation buttons. Above the screen, we have the front facing camera, a diffused selfie flash, the earpiece, and sensors.    The volume and power buttons are on the right of the phone, and are slightly out of reach when you’re holding the phone normally, but feel solid. Up top, there's an IR emitter just like on previous Redmi Note smartphones. At the bottom of the phone, we have a 3.5mm headphone socket, microphone, Micro-USB port, and a speaker grille. Once again, It’s a bit disappointing to not have a Type-C port. Considering that this is the ‘Pro’ model, we would have appreciated the newer connector. On the left, we have a hybrid dual-SIM slot which can accommodate two Nano-SIMs or a microSD card (up to 128GB) in the second slot. The metal back reminds us a lot of the Redmi Note 4, with its matte finish and slightly tapering edges. The fingerprint sensor lines up comfortably against your finger when you hold the phone, and authentication is quick. The camera bump is very noticeable, and let’s face it, its design has been, shall we say, ""heavily inspired"" by the iPhone X (Review). Even the arrangement is the same, with the two camera sensors flanking the dual-LED flash. The bump also means that this phone rests at an awkward angle when you place it on a flat surface. The back is otherwise plain, save for a printed Mi logo towards the bottom.    We received our test unit without any packaging but Xiaomi told us that buyers can expect a bundle similar to that of the Redmi Note 5, including the standard charger and silicone case. The phone is pretty tall, which makes it a challenge to fit snugly into the pockets of some pants, but that isn't much of an issue otherwise. On the other hand, the width is manageable, making this phone easy to grip with one hand. We also got used to the slightly heavier weight after a couple days of using it. Overall, the Redmi Note 5 Pro is built well and looks good. Xiaomi is hailing the Redmi Note 5 Pro as the spiritual successor to the Redmi Note 3 (Review), which is true from a performance standpoint. The Redmi Note 3 raised the bar for performance at the Rs. 15,000 price level, and the Redmi Note 5 raises it once again. This is the first phone to use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 636 mobile platform, which was announced last October. This is only the second SoC outside the Qualcomm's flagship 800 series to feature the company's own custom Kryo CPU cores. We have a total of eight Kryo 260 cores which can run at a maximum clock speed of 1.8GHz and are split into two clusters of four ‘performance’ cores and four ‘efficiency’ cores. Just like the Snapdragon 630 SoC on the Moto X4 (Review), this one is fabricated using the smaller 14nm process, but with a slightly faster Adreno 509 GPU. Qualcomm says this new GPU should offer better gaming performance compared to the Adreno 508 in the Snapdragon 630. Our review unit came running a beta build of Xiaomi's MIUI software, on which most benchmarks didn't run, in order to prevent leaks before launch. However, we did manage to run AnTuTu, which gave us a score of 85,838 points, and PCMark Work 2.0, which gave us a score of 5,619. This is a performance jump of around 10 precent on average compared to the Snapdragon 625 SoC used by the Redmi Note 5.    The Redmi Note 5 Pro is available with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM, although the storage remains the same at 64GB in both variants. You can expand by up to 128GB this using a miroSD card. The phone also has Bluetooth 5, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, GPS, FM radio, USB-OTG, and an array of sensors including a gyroscope. 4G is supported with VoLTE. This phone's MIUI software is still based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, which is a bit disappointing to see and we don't have any official word on when we can expect an Oreo update as of now. The Android security level is also not up to date -  our unit was patched till December 2017, though this could also be due to it being a beta build so we'll give Xiaomi the benefit of the doubt. The custom skin is similar to what we’ve seen on other recent Xiaomi offerings such as the Redmi 5A (Review) and Redmi Y1 (Review).

Since we tested this phone with beta firmware, the option for 4K video recording wasn't shown. We did check with Xiaomi about this and the company said that 4K video recording is meant to be supported, but an update might not be released by the time this phone goes on sale. Still, 1080p video recorded under good light is impressive. You can enable electronic stabilisation, which causes minor ‘shimmering’ anomalies in the output but this is something that might be fixed with future updates. The stabilisation itself works very well, even when you’re moving about. However, continuous autofocus wasn't very effective when recording video. When switched off, autofocus was more on point. There are also slow-motion and time-lapse video modes, which work well enough. The Short Video shooting mode records a 10-second video clip but the audio quality is quite poor. Panorama mode also works well and is quick in stitching frames together. Manual mode offers limited functionality as it only lets you change the white balance and ISO. Selfie shot on Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro using Depth Mode (tap for full-sized sample)    The front 20-megapixel sensor captures detailed selfies in daylight, although HDR isn’t too effective under strong sunlight. There’s a Depth Mode which uses Xiaomi’s AI learning algorithms for edge detection. In practice, it works quite well. It managed to blur out most of the background of our test shots (with a few misses here and there). There’s a selfie light, which fires diffused white light on your face, helping in very low light. Beautification can be turned on if needed, and you can choose the level of the effect and also modify some of your facial features. The 4000mAh battery in the Redmi Note 5 Pro easily lasted us through more than a day of medium to heavy usage. The bundled 10W charger doesn’t support quick charging but the phone itself does. We tried it with our own Qualcomm Quick Charge power adapter and a notification on the lock screen indicated that the phone was charging quickly. The charging icon in the status bar also changed to the Quick Charge logo. In our HD video loop test, we managed to get 16 hours and 36 minutes of continuous video playback on a single charge.  VerdictThe Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro offers plenty of reasons to spend that extra bit of money over the Redmi Note 5. The list of improvements includes a better set of cameras, slightly better battery life, and a more powerful processor - all of which make the usage experience just a bit nicer. The weight of the phone is something you will have to get used to, and even though it isn’t very striking to look at, the build quality is solid. We love the new taller display, which is sharp and has very good sunlight legibility. Portrait mode works very well for the front and rear cameras, and this is backed by solid battery life and very good overall app and system performance. Given that this is a ‘Pro’ model, we would have liked to see more features, such as a bundled fast charger, USB Type-C port, and maybe a more distinctive design which would have set this phone apart from the non-Pro model. Having Android Oreo out-of-the-box would have also been a nice touch for enthusiasts, who Xiaomi is targeting here. At a starting price of Rs. 13,999, this phone is pretty hard to beat. You have Xiaomi’s own Mi A1 (Review) at the same price, which is also a good pick especially if you’re looking for stock Android interface like on the Google Pixel series. The Moto G5S Plus (Review) has long been one of our top picks at this price point, but now, there’s really no matching the Redmi Note 5 Pro in terms of performance and features at this price.

2235,21,redmi-note-5-pro-review-1812789,9,10,2018-02-16,1812789,Roydon Cerejo,Redmi Note 5 Pro Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/redmi-note-5-pro-review-1812789," Many Android flagships in 2017 boasted of taller screens with nearly no borders as their headlining feature. Naturally, we started seeing this trend trickle down to the mid-range and entry-level segments, with phones like the InFocus Vision 3 (Review) and Honor 9 Lite (Review) to name a few. Xiaomi has been a favourite in the budget space and now it's joining the party. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 4 (Review) has been the ranked as the top selling smartphone in 2017, so expectations for the Chinese manufacturer’s brand new offerings for 2018 are incredibly high. The new Redmi Note 5 (Review) has big shoes to fill and from what we’ve seen, it manages to do so pretty well. Xiaomi has also launched a more powerful model with a better camera, and it's called the Redmi Note 5 Pro. This is the first phone to debut Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 636 mobile platform, which supports full-HD+ displays and features Qualcomm's own custom Kryo CPU cores. While all of this sounds great on paper, the big question is whether it’s worth the premium over the standard Redmi Note 5. Let’s find out.    From the front, the Redmi Note 5 Pro looks very similar to the Redmi Note 5, with the same prominent curved corners on the 18:9 display. The phone still has visible borders to the left and right of the display and comparatively thicker ones at the top and bottom. It does feel slightly heavy at 181g, which could be due to the metal back and large battery. The white and gold trim of our review unit looked good, but you can also get this phone in black, blue, or rose gold. The 5.99-inch display has a full-HD+ resolution, which is wider than what standard full-HD displays offer. Xiaomi boasts of it having a maximum brightness of 450 nits, which means that in the real world, the display is easily legible even under direct sunlight. Gorilla Glass has been used for scratch protection. There aren’t any capacitive buttons here since Xiaomi has gone with on-screen navigation buttons. Above the screen, we have the front facing camera, a diffused selfie flash, the earpiece, and sensors.    The volume and power buttons are on the right of the phone, and are slightly out of reach when you’re holding the phone normally, but feel solid. Up top, there's an IR emitter just like on previous Redmi Note smartphones. At the bottom of the phone, we have a 3.5mm headphone socket, microphone, Micro-USB port, and a speaker grille. Once again, It’s a bit disappointing to not have a Type-C port. Considering that this is the ‘Pro’ model, we would have appreciated the newer connector. On the left, we have a hybrid dual-SIM slot which can accommodate two Nano-SIMs or a microSD card (up to 128GB) in the second slot. The metal back reminds us a lot of the Redmi Note 4, with its matte finish and slightly tapering edges. The fingerprint sensor lines up comfortably against your finger when you hold the phone, and authentication is quick. The camera bump is very noticeable, and let’s face it, its design has been, shall we say, ""heavily inspired"" by the iPhone X (Review). Even the arrangement is the same, with the two camera sensors flanking the dual-LED flash. The bump also means that this phone rests at an awkward angle when you place it on a flat surface. The back is otherwise plain, save for a printed Mi logo towards the bottom.    We received our test unit without any packaging but Xiaomi told us that buyers can expect a bundle similar to that of the Redmi Note 5, including the standard charger and silicone case. The phone is pretty tall, which makes it a challenge to fit snugly into the pockets of some pants, but that isn't much of an issue otherwise. On the other hand, the width is manageable, making this phone easy to grip with one hand. We also got used to the slightly heavier weight after a couple days of using it. Overall, the Redmi Note 5 Pro is built well and looks good. Xiaomi is hailing the Redmi Note 5 Pro as the spiritual successor to the Redmi Note 3 (Review), which is true from a performance standpoint. The Redmi Note 3 raised the bar for performance at the Rs. 15,000 price level, and the Redmi Note 5 raises it once again. This is the first phone to use Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 636 mobile platform, which was announced last October. This is only the second SoC outside the Qualcomm's flagship 800 series to feature the company's own custom Kryo CPU cores. We have a total of eight Kryo 260 cores which can run at a maximum clock speed of 1.8GHz and are split into two clusters of four ‘performance’ cores and four ‘efficiency’ cores. Just like the Snapdragon 630 SoC on the Moto X4 (Review), this one is fabricated using the smaller 14nm process, but with a slightly faster Adreno 509 GPU. Qualcomm says this new GPU should offer better gaming performance compared to the Adreno 508 in the Snapdragon 630. Our review unit came running a beta build of Xiaomi's MIUI software, on which most benchmarks didn't run, in order to prevent leaks before launch. However, we did manage to run AnTuTu, which gave us a score of 85,838 points, and PCMark Work 2.0, which gave us a score of 5,619. This is a performance jump of around 10 precent on average compared to the Snapdragon 625 SoC used by the Redmi Note 5.    The Redmi Note 5 Pro is available with either 4GB or 6GB of RAM, although the storage remains the same at 64GB in both variants. You can expand by up to 128GB this using a miroSD card. The phone also has Bluetooth 5, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, GPS, FM radio, USB-OTG, and an array of sensors including a gyroscope. 4G is supported with VoLTE. This phone's MIUI software is still based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, which is a bit disappointing to see and we don't have any official word on when we can expect an Oreo update as of now. The Android security level is also not up to date -  our unit was patched till December 2017, though this could also be due to it being a beta build so we'll give Xiaomi the benefit of the doubt. The custom skin is similar to what we’ve seen on other recent Xiaomi offerings such as the Redmi 5A (Review) and Redmi Y1 (Review). The custom icon set looks polished and we like the use of pastel shades. The interface looks slick and swiping through home screens is smooth. We didn’t encounter any noticeable lag or stutter in the animations either. The leftmost home screen is dedicated to giving you card-style updates, shortcuts for apps (you can add your own too), a space to take quick notes, cricket scores, and calendar events. There's also integration with Ola which lets you tap shortcuts for your Home and Work locations, although you're redirected to the Ola app (or a Web page if you don't have it installed) to actually make bookings. The Redmi Note 5 Pro also has a bunch of pre-installed apps from Xiaomi. Mi Drop lets you send files over an ad-hoc Wi-Fi network provided the receiver also has the app installed. There’s also Mi Store and Mi Community, which can be uninstalled if not wanted.    The Settings app has a submenu for Wi-Fi calling, but there were no options to set, only a message that the feature depends on the cellular network provider. You can change the UI theme, use the fingerprint sensor to lock apps or take pictures, and set shortcuts for launching the flashlight, camera, etc. There are also familiar MIUI features such as Quick Ball, which is like Apple’s AssistiveTouch shortcut panel; one-handed mode; and Dual Apps, which lets you create two instances of some apps so that you can use them with multiple accounts. The Fullscreen Mode menu lets you force apps to run full-screen (minus black bars on the sides), and you can set the navigation bar to auto-hide for a more immersive experience. You can also optionally sign up for a Mi Cloud account, which gives you 5GB of free cloud storage for backing up your contacts, messages, calendars, notes, etc. We tested the 4GB RAM variant of the Redmi Note 5 Pro, which performed very well with day-to-day usage. The screen does attract some fingerprints but we found the rest of the body to be quite resilient to smudges and dirt. Call reception is good and the speaker is loud enough for alerts and some media playback. The phone also runs pretty cool, and even with gaming, it only gets a bit warm. Heavy camera usage doesn’t make it overheat, which is very good. For media playback, Xiaomi offers its own music and video app, which is frankly not needed when you have Google’s suite of media players preinstalled, and more feature-rich options such as MX Player available for free. High-bitrate videos played just fine, and this phone can even handle 4K playback. There’s a system-wide audio enhancement feature for headphones, which can be activated from the Settings app. Audio quality through headphones is good, and you can toggle between presets tuned to Xiaomi's various headphones, or set your own. Xiaomi says the cameras are one of the big highlights of the Redmi Note 5 Pro, and in our experience, they were pretty good. At the back of the phone, there's a primary 12-megapixel camera with 1.25 micron pixels on its sensor and a f/2.2 aperture, while the second 5-megapixel camera is only used for sensing depth for the Portrait Mode effect. This works decently well for human subjects but the edge detection isn’t always accurate for other objects. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro camera samples   Landscapes shot in daylight have good detail, with very good colours. The phone struggles to get the white balance right at times under harsh sunlight, but otherwise, light metering is handled well. Edges in close-ups aren't very sharp but this is only noticeable when zoomed in at 100 percent. Sadly, HDR doesn’t kick in automatically (it does so with the front camera) so you’ll have to remember to engage it manually. In low light, autofocus gets a bit slower and shutter lag does creep in, but image quality doesn’t degrade too badly.

2234,21,redmi-note-5-review-1812793,8,10,2018-02-15,1812793,Aditya Shenoy,Redmi Note 5 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/redmi-note-5-review-1812793," There is no denying that Xiaomi has a tight grip on the budget segment in the Indian smartphone market. The Chinese manufacturer's Redmi and Redmi Note series have been really popular, so much so that the Redmi Note 4 (Review) recently became India's best selling smartphone. It also helped Xiaomi become the number one smartphone seller in India, beating Samsung and other rivals. Now, almost a year after the launch of the Redmi Note 4, Xiaomi has come up with a new model to replace it. The Redmi 5 Plus, first launched in China, has been rebranded as the Redmi Note 5 in India, and has been positioned as the successor to the Redmi Note 4. This new smartphone has some big shoes to fill, but is it equipped to take the brand's legacy forward? We put it to the test.    The Redmi Note 5 is the first smartphone in the Redmi series to sport a tall 18:9 display. In fact, that’s the first thing to grab your attention when you pick this phone up. The 5.99-inch display occupies most of the front on the phone and has rounded corners like the Google Pixel 2 XL (Review). It sports a full-HD+ resolution putting out 403 pixels per inch. It has a layer of 2.5D Gorilla Glass 3 for protection. The tall display format means that there are thin borders on the sides but slightly bigger ones at the top and the bottom. There's a recessed metallic earpiece grille and selfie camera with a diffused LED flash above it, while the lower border is blank. The phone has a metal body with plastic caps at the top and the bottom of the rear for the antennas. The new screen aspect ratio makes the phone relatively narrow and tall. It weighs 180g, but the curved sides makes the phone easy to hold and use in one hand. Xiaomi has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right while the hybrid dual-SIM tray is on the left. We found that the power button is conveniently placed while the volume buttons require a stretch to reach. The phone has a Micro-USB port at the bottom with grilles on either side, though only only one is a speaker while the other is just for show. The phone also has an IR emitter on the top, which can come in handy to control IR appliances like TVs.    At the back, Xiaomi has used the same design as the Redmi Note 4 and positioned the rear camera, dual-tone LED flash and the fingerprint scanner down the centre. The phone appears to be slimmer than the Redmi Note 4 but the camera module protrudes slightly causing it to rock when placed on a flat surface. Xiaomi will sell the Redmi Note 5 in four colours, namely Gold, Black, Rose Gold, and Blue. We had a Black review unit which looks quite good and doesn't pick up too many fingerprints. The Redmi Note 5 ships with a 10W charger and USB cable in the box along with a TPU case. People who compare the specifications of the Redmi Note 4 and the Redmi Note 5 will say that not much has changed, because the new model is powered by the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor. Xiaomi told Gadgets 360 that it is still powerful enough for this segment, and has good thermal management. The Snapdragon 625 has eight Cortex-A53 cores clocked at 2.0GHz and an Adreno 506 GPU for graphics. The Redmi Note 4 was available with 2GB of RAM and 16GB of storage at Rs. 9,999, but now with the Redmi Note 5, you get 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage at the same price. There's also a variant with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, priced aggressively at Rs 11,999. The Redmi Note 5 sports a 12-megapixel primary camera with 1.25-micron pixels along with an f/2.2 aperture and PDAF. On paper, it has a lower resolution when compared to the 13-megapixel camera on the Note 4, but Xiaomi says that the camera has larger pixels which helps it take better shots. The phone has a hybrid dual-SIM tray that accepts two Nano-SIMs or one SIM along with a microSD card of up to 128GB. It has support for Bluetooth 4.2, Dual-band Wi-Fi, GPS, USB-OTG, and FM Radio.    Xiaomi has gone with a 4000mAh battery with the Redmi Note 5, which is slightly smaller than the 4100mAh battery of its predecessor. The battery is non-removable and Xiaomi ships a standard 5V, 2A charger in the box even though the phone supports Qualcomm Quick Charge. We did manage to charge the phone quickly using a certified third-party charger. In terms of software, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 runs on Android 7.1.2 Nougat with MIUI 9 on top. Xiaomi’s skin is different to stock Android, and while MIUI users will be at home, new users will need some time getting used to it. The Settings menus are rearranged and we found ourselves using the search function quite often. MIUI supports for Dual Apps and Second Space which help you keep your private data safe. You also get gestures which can be used to quickly take screenshots and launch apps. You also get a fair number of preinstalled apps including several Google and Microsoft ones, and Xiaomi’s own Mi Community, Mi Store, Mi Remote, Mi File manager, and Mi Video. Amazon, Hungama, and WPS Office apps are also preinstalled. Google apps and a few Mi apps couldn't be uninstalled whereas the others can be uninstalled to free up space. The Redmi Note 4 was a good all-rounder and there are very few phones that can match it at its price. Xiaomi has kept the formula untouched and the Note 5 gets the same powerful hardware as its predecessors. We did not face any lags or stutters in the UI, and while basic apps load super quickly, big apps aren't all that slow either. Our review unit was the variant with 4GB of RAM, and it was sufficient for multitasking without apps getting killed in the background. While running benchmarks we saw that performance was similar to what the Note 4 offered. The Redmi Note 5 managed to score 871 and 4333 in Geekbench 4's single-core and multi-core tests respectively. In AnTuTu, the phone managed to clock 77,682, and the graphics score in GFXBench was 18fps. We can also say that the Redmi Note 5 doubles up as a good media player. It managed to play all the audio and video formats we threw at it. The display has good viewing angles and its colour output can be tweaked to suit your liking. It gets bright enough to be viewable under direct sunlight. We found that the speaker was loud enough to make content engaging. However, you will have to be careful not to muffle the speaker grille with your palms.    The Redmi Note 5 managed to outlast the Redmi Note 4 in our battery tests despite having a lower capacity battery and a bigger screen. It managed to clock 16 hours and 8 minutes in our HD video loop test compared to 15 hours and 10 minutes of the previous model. The new phone is very frugal with power, and managed to last one full day with light to medium use. It handles standby really well and we found that it did not lose much power when idle. While we would have liked a quick charger in the box, we would still spend extra on one for sheer convenience. The Redmi Note 5 has an upgraded camera sensor but the software remains roughly the same as before. When you launch the camera app, it is set to auto mode by default, and you can choose between Manual, Beauty, and Panorama modes as well as different scene modes. The Manual mode is somewhat restricted and only gives you control over the White Balance and ISO. There is a quick toggle for HDR and that’s about it. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 camera samples   Photos taken with the Redmi Note 5 during the day as well as under low light turned out well. Landscapes taken in daylight had good amounts of detail and the phone managed to get the exposure right most of the time. The phone is quick to focus which is helpful when shooting macros. We found that macros turned out better than we had expected, with a good amount of detail. Photos taken with HDR enabled had more detail in darker areas, but brighter spots could appear burnt out. We also saw that reds were a little too saturated with HDR enabled. In low light, the camera automatically switches to night mode. Landscape shots had low noise and very fine grain, which was only visible when zooming in to full size. The Redmi Note 5 managed to capture details fairly well, and even text at a distance was still legible. Macro shots needed a steady hand but the output was pretty good as well. The Redmi Note 5 has a diffused selfie flash which is handy in low light. The app has a beauty mode which can be set to alter shots automatically, or you can also manually set the level of beautification. Selfies are a little grainy but usable for social media. Video recording maxes out at 4K for the rear camera and 1080p for the front one. We found that the output was a little warm at 4K, while 1080p footage was good enough. There is no stabilisation, but that is not a problem for a phone at this price. VerdictXiaomi has been quite innovative with its Redmi Note series. The Redmi Note 3 (Review) showed us how powerful a phone could while still remaining affordable, and the Redmi Note 4 (Review) impressed us for being power efficient as well. Xiaomi seems to have played it safe with the Redmi Note 5, and it feels like a Redmi Note 4 with a better screen and lower price to keep up with the times, which is not a bad thing at all. It takes a solid foundation and improves on it, giving Xiaomi another good all-rounder. With a starting price of Rs 9,999, the Redmi Note 5 offers tremendous value for money. Those with a higher budget who want a little more in terms of features and power can take a look at the Redmi Note 5 Pro.

2464,21,redmi-note-7-review-xiaomi-price-in-india-2011365,8,10,2019-03-23,2011365,Roydon Cerejo,Redmi Note 7 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/redmi-note-7-review-xiaomi-price-in-india-2011365," The Redmi Note series from Xiaomi has helped shape what the budget smartphone segment in India is today. We've had some iconic phones such as the Redmi Note 3 (Review), Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review), and now the Redmi Note 7 Pro (Review), all of which upped the performance ante in the budget segment by introducing powerful SoCs under Rs. 15,000. Today, we'll be reviewing the Redmi Note 7, which launched in India alongside the Redmi Note 7 Pro, but has an even more approachable starting price of just Rs. 9,999. Of course you don't get all the bells and whistles of its bigger sibling, such as the 48-megapixel rear camera, but given the price point and target audience of this model, it seems as though Xiaomi has retained just enough to keep it competitive. We've got the 4GB version of the Redmi Note 7 in for review, which is priced at Rs. 11,999. Let's see if it manages to offer as much value as its sibling.   While the Redmi Note 6 Pro (Review) didn't look very different from its predecessor, with the new Redmi Note 7 series, Xiaomi seems to have gone the extra mile and really knocked it out of the park in terms of design. Available in three striking colours, the Redmi Note 7 features a glass back which we haven't seen at this price point since the Nokia 5.1 Plus (Review). Xiaomi has gone a step further and used Gorilla Glass 5 for the front and back of the phone, which is quite impressive at this price point.

On paper, it's not as powerful as the Snapdragon 675 that the Redmi Note 7 Pro is built around, but it's more than enough to handle its fair share of work. The fact that you can get this much power for just under Rs. 10,000 (with the base version of the Redmi Note 7) is an achievement in itself. The Redmi Note 7 starts with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage at that price, and the variant we're reviewing has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage for Rs. 2,000 more. The Redmi Note 7 also supports dual 4G VoLTE, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 5, three satellite navigation systems, FM radio, USB-OTG, and the usual variety of sensors.

The processor has enough power to handle the usual social and productivity apps that we all use, and it even does a good job in games. Unlike the Redmi Note 7 Pro, the Redmi Note 7 doesn't have any heating issues. Sure, the phone got warm after we played heavy titles such as PUBG Mobile for a little while, but it wasn't severe enough to make us take a break between gaming sessions. The Redmi Note 7 is a tall phone, but MIUI has a one-handed software mode that can be activated with a swipe gesture on the Home button. We found this to be a little buggy, and it wouldn't work as expected most of the time. Apart from the quick fingerprint sensor, the phone also has AI face recognition. This is decently quick under good light and there's even a raise-to-wake gesture, but it isn't reliable in low-light, and it refused to work properly for us. The Redmi Note 7 handles apps and games with ease, without any overheating issues  The Redmi Note 7 handled playback of media files well in our tests. Videos were sharp and colours were punchy, although black levels could have been better. The phone is also Widevine L1 certified, which means you'll be able to stream TV shows and movies at the highest supported resolution from services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. The single speaker gets fairly loud, and since it's placed towards the bottom right, it's not easily blocked when holding the phone in landscape mode. The Redmi Note 7 might lack the massive 48-megapixel primary camera of its Pro sibling, but it still has some decent specifications. At the back, you get a 12-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. The main lens has an f/2.2 aperture so we're not expecting any award-winning low-light shots. The camera app offers features such as AI Scene Detection along with standard shooting modes such as Panorama, Portrait, Pro, and Square. In daylight, the Redmi Note 7 captured fairly decent images. Colours and details were good, although a bit of sharpness was lacking. There were also minor traces of chromatic aberration when shooting against bright backgrounds, and the HDR doesn't always handle the exposure of bright areas well. The camera app's AI system did a good job in detecting objects such as buildings, plants, flowers, etc but that didn't always result in good images. For instance, with macros, the camera's AI can boost colours to unnatural levels, making the subject look artificial. You can switch it off before taking a shot but there's no way to turn the effect off later in the Gallery. Tap to see full-sized Redmi Note 7 camera samples  The depth sensor helps in capturing good portrait shots. Edge detection was good for objects and people. Low-light performance was decent but not great. Colours were good and even finer details in landscape shots were quite legible, given adequate lighting. Images weren't too noisy either, which is a good thing. Just as we were wrapping up our review, we got a system update which added a new ‘Night' shooting mode. This takes a second longer to process shots, but the end results were generally a bit brighter than using Auto mode. The tradeoffs were increased grain, and colours looking a bit off at times. Looking at the EXIF data embedded in our camera samples, Night mode only seems to alter the ISO to make images brighter. The shutter speed is locked to 1/15 of a second with either mode. In some samples, even the ISO stayed the same, and the app simply boosted the brightness of the final image using software algorithms. Tap to see full-sized Redmi Note 7 camera sample  The front-facing 13-megapixel camera captured good selfies under good lighting. The AI beatification isn't too aggressive, and we ended up with some pleasant skin softening effects. You can shoot selfies with a bokeh effect too, and the edge detection was not bad. In low light, selfies looked good too, albeit a little soft. Video quality isn't very impressive. When shooting outdoors in daylight, bright areas were often overexposed. Electronic stabilisation is applied after you end a recording, so you don't get a preview of how your video will look while filming it. There was a noticeable shimmer in the footage when we were walking about, but this isn't terrible, considering the price of the Redmi Note 7. There's no 4K option, which is understandable. You do get a 1080p 60fps mode, although we did notice a bit of focus hunting here. You also get other shooting modes such as time-lapse and slow-motion, which worked fairly well for us. The Redmi Note 7 has pretty sizeable 4000mAh battery and this phone also supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge 4 fast charging standard, if you use the right charger. However you still get only a standard 10W charger in the box. With the bundled charger, we were able to charge the phone up to 57 percent in an hour. Battery life is good, and we typically managed to average an entire day's worth of usage on a single charge with a little left over. In our HD video battery loop test, the Redmi Note 7 ran for 12 hours and 52 minutes, which is not bad at all but at the same time, a lot less than the Redmi Note 7 Pro, which has the same battery capacity and ran for over 19 hours. VerdictWith a starting price of Rs. 9,999, the base variant of the Redmi Note 7 — which we haven't tested — seems like a no-brainer. You get a good looking phone with excellent build quality, a good display, a decent set of cameras, solid app performance, and day-long battery life. If you're someone who uses two SIMs and a microSD card, then this is not the phone for you, as the Redmi Note 7 has a hybrid dual-SIM slot. You might want to consider the base variant of the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 instead, which is currently selling at just under Rs. 10,000 online. A few other annoyances with the Redmi Note 7 include its preinstalled bloatware, average low-light camera performance, and the fact that Xiaomi still doesn't bundle a fast charger in the box. The higher priced 4GB RAM version of the Redmi Note 7, which we tested, is a good pick at Rs. 11,999. However, if you're looking for camera performance then we think you'd be happier with the Realme 2 Pro (Review) or even Xiaomi's Mi A2 (Review). There are plenty of good and powerful smartphones in India that cost less than Rs. 15,000 and the Redmi Note 7 is certainly one of them.

We've had some iconic phones such as the Redmi Note 3 (Review), Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review), and now the Redmi Note 7 Pro (Review), all of which upped the performance ante in the budget segment by introducing powerful SoCs under Rs. 15,000. Today, we'll be reviewing the Redmi Note 7, which launched in India alongside the Redmi Note 7 Pro, but has an even more approachable starting price of just Rs. 9,999. Of course you don't get all the bells and whistles of its bigger sibling, such as the 48-megapixel rear camera, but given the price point and target audience of this model, it seems as though Xiaomi has retained just enough to keep it competitive. We've got the 4GB version of the Redmi Note 7 in for review, which is priced at Rs. 11,999. Let's see if it manages to offer as much value as its sibling.   While the Redmi Note 6 Pro (Review) didn't look very different from its predecessor, with the new Redmi Note 7 series, Xiaomi seems to have gone the extra mile and really knocked it out of the park in terms of design. Available in three striking colours, the Redmi Note 7 features a glass back which we haven't seen at this price point since the Nokia 5.1 Plus (Review). Xiaomi has gone a step further and used Gorilla Glass 5 for the front and back of the phone, which is quite impressive at this price point. The sides are still plastic, but overall, this device feels very premium to hold. The body also has a P2i nano coating which is said to make this phone splash-proof. The Redmi Note 7 is a little tall but the sides are thick enough to offer a comfortable grip, even with the glossy finish on the Ruby Red version that we have for review. The Redmi Note 7 is a little heavy at 185g, even though you don't really feel the heft with normal use. The power and volume buttons are on the right, and have good tactile response. The Redmi Note 7 looks striking in Ruby Red  On the left of the Redmi Note 7, we have a single tray for either two Nano-SIMs or one Nano-SIM and a microSD card. A hybrid dual-SIM tray is a bit of a letdown, especially considering that most recent launches in this segment have a dedicated slot for expandable storage.

The ports are placed ergonomically, with the 3.5mm headphone socket at the top and the USB Type-C port down at the bottom. It's nice to see Xiaomi finally adopting Type-C connectivity for its budget offerings. The Redmi Note 7 also has an IR blaster on the top, which can be used for controlling infrared home appliances via the Mi Remote app. The Redmi Note 7 does have a white notification LED tucked away in a rather unusual position in the chin below the screen, making it easy to miss. The borders around the 6.3-inch display are quite pronounced and noticeable, especially the dewdrop notch which houses the selfie camera. The LCD panel has a full-HD+ resolution, with good colour reproduction and decently high brightness of 450nits which helps in daylight.

Tap to see full-sized Redmi Note 7 camera samples  The depth sensor helps in capturing good portrait shots. Edge detection was good for objects and people. Low-light performance was decent but not great. Colours were good and even finer details in landscape shots were quite legible, given adequate lighting. Images weren't too noisy either, which is a good thing. Just as we were wrapping up our review, we got a system update which added a new ‘Night' shooting mode. This takes a second longer to process shots, but the end results were generally a bit brighter than using Auto mode. The tradeoffs were increased grain, and colours looking a bit off at times. Looking at the EXIF data embedded in our camera samples, Night mode only seems to alter the ISO to make images brighter. The shutter speed is locked to 1/15 of a second with either mode. In some samples, even the ISO stayed the same, and the app simply boosted the brightness of the final image using software algorithms. Tap to see full-sized Redmi Note 7 camera sample  The front-facing 13-megapixel camera captured good selfies under good lighting. The AI beatification isn't too aggressive, and we ended up with some pleasant skin softening effects. You can shoot selfies with a bokeh effect too, and the edge detection was not bad. In low light, selfies looked good too, albeit a little soft. Video quality isn't very impressive. When shooting outdoors in daylight, bright areas were often overexposed. Electronic stabilisation is applied after you end a recording, so you don't get a preview of how your video will look while filming it. There was a noticeable shimmer in the footage when we were walking about, but this isn't terrible, considering the price of the Redmi Note 7. There's no 4K option, which is understandable. You do get a 1080p 60fps mode, although we did notice a bit of focus hunting here. You also get other shooting modes such as time-lapse and slow-motion, which worked fairly well for us. The Redmi Note 7 has pretty sizeable 4000mAh battery and this phone also supports Qualcomm's Quick Charge 4 fast charging standard, if you use the right charger. However you still get only a standard 10W charger in the box. With the bundled charger, we were able to charge the phone up to 57 percent in an hour. Battery life is good, and we typically managed to average an entire day's worth of usage on a single charge with a little left over. In our HD video battery loop test, the Redmi Note 7 ran for 12 hours and 52 minutes, which is not bad at all but at the same time, a lot less than the Redmi Note 7 Pro, which has the same battery capacity and ran for over 19 hours. VerdictWith a starting price of Rs. 9,999, the base variant of the Redmi Note 7 — which we haven't tested — seems like a no-brainer. You get a good looking phone with excellent build quality, a good display, a decent set of cameras, solid app performance, and day-long battery life. If you're someone who uses two SIMs and a microSD card, then this is not the phone for you, as the Redmi Note 7 has a hybrid dual-SIM slot. You might want to consider the base variant of the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 instead, which is currently selling at just under Rs. 10,000 online. A few other annoyances with the Redmi Note 7 include its preinstalled bloatware, average low-light camera performance, and the fact that Xiaomi still doesn't bundle a fast charger in the box. The higher priced 4GB RAM version of the Redmi Note 7, which we tested, is a good pick at Rs. 11,999. However, if you're looking for camera performance then we think you'd be happier with the Realme 2 Pro (Review) or even Xiaomi's Mi A2 (Review). There are plenty of good and powerful smartphones in India that cost less than Rs. 15,000 and the Redmi Note 7 is certainly one of them. Do Redmi Note 7 Pro, Redmi Note 7, and Mi Soundbar redefine their price segments?

2202,21,redmi-y1-review-1772369,7,10,2017-11-08,1772369,Aditya Shenoy,Redmi Y1 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/redmi-y1-review-1772369," Xiaomi has been in the Indian market for close to four years now, during which time it has managed to climb up to the number two spot, just behind Samsung. With the top spot in sight, the Chinese company has been steadily widening its portfolio in the country. In the last few months, we saw the introduction of its flagship, the Mi Mix 2 (Review), and the Android One-powered Mi A1 (Review). Xiaomi has launched yet another series in the country this month, dubbed the Redmi Y series. With this move, Xiaomi is looking at a dedicated lineup to cash in on the selfie craze. Its first device, the Redmi Y1, has good specifications on paper, but should it be your first choice? We find out.    One look at the Redmi Y1 and it is safe to say that it carries the family look. We wouldn’t be surprised if you mistook it for the Redmi 4 at first glance. Hold the phone and you will see that the Redmi Y1 is bigger than the Redmi 4, sporting a 5.5-inch display. This selfie-focused phone has a 16-megapixel camera at the front along with a diffused selfie flash. There are non-backlit capacitive touch buttons below the screen for navigation instead of on-screen touch buttons, and the usual sensors above it as well. Pick the phone up and you will notice that it is fairly light at 153g. Xiaomi has used plastic in its construction, which helps keep the weight down. While the chrome highlights give the impression that it has a metal backplate, the entire rear and sides along with the power and volume buttons are made out of plastic. The 13-megapixel primary camera and the single-LED flash are positioned in the top left corner while the fingerprint scanner is at the centre. The scanner location is convenient making it easy to reach.  The bottom of the phone has the Micro-USB port for charging, and grilles on either side. It also has an IR emitter that some might find handy, located on the top of the phone along with a secondary mic for noise cancellation and a 3.5mm headphone jack. We liked the build quality of the Y1 because it still feels premium despite the plastic. The packaging of the Redmi Y1 is bare basic and so are the contents - in the box you only get a SIM ejector tool, a 10W adapter, and a Micro-USB cable. ""If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it"", seems to have been Xiaomi’s motto while designing the Redmi Y1. To power the device Xiaomi has chosen the same Snapdragon 435 SoC that is currently powering its Redmi 4 (Review) smartphone. This is an octa-core processor clocked at 1.4GHz. The Y1 has two variants, one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and the other with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Pick either and you still get the option to expand storage by up to 128GB using the dedicated microSD card slot. While the screen size has grown to 5.5 inches compared to the Redmi 4, it still has the same HD 720x1280 resolution. There is 2.5D curved Corning Gorilla Glass for protection. The highlights of the Y1 are its 16-megapixel front-facing camera and diffused selfie flash. There are very few phones that have such a sensor at the front, and the inclusion of the front facing flash increases its appeal. The primary camera on the rear has a 13-megapixel sensor with PDAF and a f/2.2 aperture.  To power the Y1, Xiaomi has used a 3080mAh non-removable battery which is lower capacity than the 4100mAh unit in the Redmi 4. For connectivity, the Redmi Y1 has Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, GPS, AGPS, GLONASS and Beidou support. Sensors on the Redmi Y1 include an accelerometer, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, electronic compass, hall sensor, and gyroscope. There is support for 4G and VoLTE on both SIMs but only one can access a 4G network at a time. For our review, we had the 3GB/32GB variant of the Redmi Y1 running MIUI 9 Beta on top of Android Nougat. MIUI 9 has quite a few new features. The Redmi Y1 will initially be sold with MIUI 8 but will be updated to the final version of MIUI 9 in the coming weeks. It is unknown whether Xiaomi plans to upgrade the underlying version of Android. If you have used MIUI before, you’ll find yourself at home when navigating through menus and the Settings app, but if you have been used to stock Android or a different skin of Android then you might take some time to adapt to it. Settings are rearranged to some extent and MIUI handles apps permissions a little differently. Once you get a hang of it, you might like the flexibility and convenience that MIUI offers over stock Android.   Some of the added features include Dual Apps, which lets you create two instances of an app on the phone so you can have two instances of apps such as Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and others. There's a reading mode as well, which makes the screen colour tone warmer and more comfortable to use at night. Xiaomi has quite a few of its apps preinstalled including Mi Browser, Mi Drop, Mi Remote, Mi Community, Mi Store, Mi Video, Notes, Recorder, Weather and also a couple of third-party apps like WPS Office, Amazon Shopping and UC News. Xiaomi also has its own curated app store called Apps and a Security app as well. There is theme support which lets you change the look of the phone in a couple of seconds. Since we were on MIUI 9 Beta, preinstalled apps might be different on MIUI 8 and MIUI 9 when it finally releases for the Y1. With proven internals, it isn’t surprising that the Y1 provides a decent lag free experience. The phone is quick to unlock itself after scanning your fingerprint, and quick to launch apps on MIUI 9. We liked the display on the Y1, as colour reproduction is accurate and viewing angles are quite good. You can also tweak the display by changing the colour temperature and contrast to suit your taste. The phone could multitask with several apps running, without killing background processes. Overall, we were happy with the software and hardware combination that Xiaomi has on offer. We played games such as Clash Royale, Asphalt 8 and Prime Peaks while testing. The phone has no trouble running these games and it rarely got warm. However, we did notice that longer gaming times did affect the battery adversely. Only the right grill houses a speaker, and while it is loud enough, it is also easy to muffle when holding the phone in landscape mode.  To check how the Y1 performs, we put it through a series of benchmarks. It clocked 45,762 in AnTuTu and managed 668 and 2,503 respectively in Geekbench's single-core and multi-core test. Battery life is average on the Redmi Y1, and it lasted one day only if we restricted ourselves to light use. In our HD video loop test, the Y1 survived for 9 hours and 45 minutes which is lower than the 14 hours and 20 minutes that the Redmi 4 clocked with its larger battery and smaller screen. If battery life is a priority, the Redmi 4 looks like a better option. The camera app on the Y1 is similar to that of other Xiaomi phones. You get quite a lot of modes to choose from including Panorama, Beautify and Manual. The app has quick toggles for HDR and the flash which are quite handy. The selfie camera mode also has a control for Beautify mode which can be set to different levels or to Auto. Photos taken in daylight have good amounts of detail and colours are quite accurate. Low light is where the camera performance isn’t great. The phone manages to keep noise levels down but the output is grainy and you will need a steady hand to take usable photos. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi Y1 camera samples Selfies are the highlight of this new series, and we tested the front camera under various lighting conditions. In daylight, images are sharp but have a lot of grain which is visible on zooming in. In low-light, the selfie flash is quite handy and portraits turn out well, but grain is still visible in the background. Beautify mode does smoothen the output resulting in a better image, but overall the front camera isn’t quite there yet. Xiaomi Redmi Y1 in pictures The Redmi Y1 is Xiaomi’s first attempt at making a selfie-focused phone. The hardware is proven and good enough to run most things you might throw at it. MIUI 9 is smooth and people should find it easy to adapt to. Camera performance is good in daylight but is average in low-light. As for selfies, the flash is helpful and the beautify mode does work a bit, but the output is not always good. The biggest competitor to the Redmi Y1 is Xiaomi's own Redmi 4. Both phones are priced similarly and have similar core hardware. The Redmi 4 gets a much bigger battery in a more compact metal body, but the Redmi Y1 has a bigger screen and front flash. If you are selfie-obsessed, the Redmi Y1 could make sense. For most others though, the Redmi 4 is still the phone to beat at this price. Editor's note: When the review was originally published, it carried a battery score of 8 instead of 7 due to human error while entering them in our system. The review text remains unchanged. The error is deeply regretted. Why did Xiaomi launch the Redmi Y1 series of smartphones?

2484,21,samsung-a30-review-price-in-india-galaxy-a30-2007044,7,10,2019-03-21,2007044,Roydon Cerejo,Samsung Galaxy A30 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/samsung-a30-review-price-in-india-galaxy-a30-2007044," Samsung's flagship offerings have so far remained popular with those who have lots of money to spend, but the company hasn't been as competitive in the budget segment of the market. That has begun to change this year, as Samsung seems to have finally gotten with the programme with its new Galaxy M and Galaxy A series phones, with as many as six new models launched in recent weeks. The Samsung Galaxy A50 (Review) and Galaxy M30 (Review) fared very well in our tests, and we feel that both these phones are worth recommending. Today, we'll be taking a closer look at the Galaxy A30, which is the more affordable sibling of the Galaxy A50. It features two rear cameras instead of three, and a less powerful processor. The Samsung Galaxy A30 overlaps with the Galaxy M30, both in terms of features and price, so it will be interesting to see how it compares, and whether it makes sense to buy this model over the Galaxy M30 and the rest of the competition. The Galaxy A30 is a big phone to carry around, even if you have large hands. Samsung has maximised the front of the phone by using a big 6.4-inch display with slim borders all around. The chin area is thicker than the other sides, but it's not an eyesore. The Galaxy A30 has a full-HD+ Infinity-U display, just like the Galaxy A50 and Galaxy M30. It's a Super AMOLED panel too, which means colours are vivid and everything from images to text really pops. There's no mention of Gorilla Glass or any other kind of reinforced glass, but the display seemed pretty resilient to scratches in the time we spent using this phone. The glossy sides and back look good but also attract smudges and fingerprints easily. The phone is fairly slim but we found the grip to be adequate. The buttons on the right have the same glossy treatment as the rest of the sides. The SIM tray can accommodate two Nano-SIM cards and a microSD card (up to 512GB). The speaker, 3.5mm headphone socket, and USB Type-C port are all at the bottom. The back of the Galaxy A30 has slightly tapering edges, which make it look slender. The back has the appearance of glass but it is actually plastic. It didn't pick up scuffs easily with everyday use, but a more forceful impact could leave a lasting scar. The fingerprint sensor is placed a bit too high up for our liking and we had to really stretch our index finger, or at times, shuffle the phone around to reach it. Fingerprint recognition is quick but the placement was a bit awkward. The Samsung Galaxy A30 has a plastic black, which looks like glass   You have the option to use face recognition instead of — or in addition to — using the fingerprint scanner, but it's not very quick, not even under good light. There's no raise-to-wake gesture, so you'll have to double-tap the display to wake it. In low light, the screen brightness is boosted to light up your face, but it's still not very quick. In the box, you get a silicone case, SIM eject tool, power adapter with Adaptive Fast Charging, USB Type-C cable, and headset. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy A30 is a well-built phone, which looks decent even with its plastic body. It's available in multiple colours, and the one we have is the black version, although it looks more grey than black. The Samsung Galaxy A30 is powered by the same processor as the Galaxy M30, which is the octa-core Samsung Exynos 7904. There's only one version of this phone in India, with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Samsung hasn't gone into much detail about the phone's specifications on its website, but with the help of some Android diagnostic apps we know that it has Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, gyroscope, Hall sensor, proximity sensor, ambient light sensor, compass, GPS, FM radio, and USB-OTG. Unlike the Galaxy M30, the Galaxy A30 runs on Samsung's new One UI, which is based on Android 9 Pie. Our unit even had the fairly recent February 2019 security patch. We've already seen One UI in action on recent phones such as the Galaxy A50 (Review) and the experience is pretty similar. By default, the icons on the home screen are comically large but this can be fixed easily by choosing a denser grid for the home screen and app drawer. You can even enable a one-finger swipe-down gesture on the home screen to pull down the notifications shade. This is immensely helpful as it's nearly impossible to reach the very top of the screen comfortably with one hand. One UI on the Samsung Galaxy A30 looks slick and fresh   The phone supports Samsung Pay Mini, which is a cut-down version that only lets you set up UPI accounts, gift cards, and payment wallets. Android Pie's Digital Wellbeing is supported, which is nice to see. There are a whole bunch of motion gestures such as one-handed mode, Smart Stay, etc, which can be toggled on. The Galaxy A30 also has some pre-loaded apps including Dailyhunt and Amazon Shopping, which can be uninstalled if not needed. When we first began using the phone, we received a lot of unwanted promotions from the Galaxy Apps store, and this was before we even opened the app. However, once you go through the initial setup of Samsung's apps, you can opt out of receiving such information. When setting up the phone, you need to be a little cautious before you hit that final ‘Finish' button, as there's a checkbox right at the bottom for opting out of promotions from IronSource. This is a very sneaky way to push ads to the user, which is a little disappointing to see coming from Samsung. You also get Samsung Max, the reincarnated Opera Max VPN, which lets you browse the Internet securely. Other programs such as the calculator, Samsung Notes, etc are all optional, and you can choose not to install them when you first set up the phone. We found the Galaxy A30 to be a good performer when using the usual chat and productivity apps. It's not the most fluid experience though, as there's always a bit of lag when using some parts of the UI. We felt this when swiping over to the Bixby home screen, trying to open the gallery after taking a photo, and even simply accessing the recent apps carousel to switch between apps. The Samsung Galaxy A30 has a dual camera setup on the back   Benchmark numbers are unsurprisingly similar to those of the Galaxy M30 (Review) and Galaxy M20 (Review). AnTuTu returned a score of 1,06,260 points, while GFXbench returned just 23fps in the T-Rex test. These numbers aren't impressive, especially when you that other phones at the same price and lower feature processors such as the MediaTek Helio P70 and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 675, which post better numbers. The good news is that the phone doesn't heat up too much. It did get warm when the CPU and GPU are really stressed, like when playing PUBG Mobile, but even after taking a bunch of photos and videos outdoors, the phone didn't overheat. The Exynos 7904 does a decent job with games, but we had to scale the graphics settings down in heavier titles for a smooth enough frame rate. Asphalt 9: Legends and PUBG Mobile both ran smoothly after dropping the graphics settings slightly. The audio output from the speaker is quite weak. The volume was especially low in the games we tested but even in other apps such as YouTube, it didn't get loud enough for our liking, even in a quiet room. The speaker placement is good though, as it's not easy to block it when you hold the phone in landscape mode. The bundled headset isn't much to look at but the sound quality is surprisingly decent. You can enable Dolby Atmos for wired and Bluetooth headphones, which boosts the audio level and spatial separation a bit. There's no notification LED, but thanks to the Super AMOLED display, you can enable an always-on display to see the time and unread notifications. The Galaxy A30 has a 16-megapixel primary camera with a f/1.7 aperture, and a secondary 5-megapixel wide-angle camera without autofocus. The camera app offers the Scene Optimiser, just like on the Galaxy S10+. This automatically detects objects and adjusts the exposure accordingly. We noticed that it boosts colours slightly and also softens textures a bit, which is not something you'd always want. Landscapes had fairly good detail, and with the wide-angle sensor, you can get a lot more of any scene in the frame. There is a bit of a barrel distortion when using the wide-angle camera and details aren't as good as when shooting with the main one due to the lack of autofocus. The macros we captured under good light had good detail and colours. Edges were sharp and well defined, which was nice to see. Despite the wide aperture, low-light landscapes were blurry and lacked good detail. Noise was surpassed well, but overall, photos taken in low light were quite underwhelming. It was even worse when we switched to the wide-angle sensor in low-light. Macros fared a little better but were still below average. Shot using the primary lens on the Samsung Galaxy A30 (tap to see full-sized image)   Shot using the wide-angle lens on the Samsung Galaxy A30 (tap to see full-sized image)   Tap for full-sized images of Samsung Galaxy A30 camera samples   Samsung's camera app has the typical modes such as Panorama, Pro, and Live Focus, which is Samsung's portrait mode. With the latter, you can adjust the level of background blur before and after taking a shot. Edge detection is good and the Galaxy A30 got it right most of the time. However, in low-light, images shot using Live focus looked patchy and lacked good detail. The front 16-megapixel selfie camera has an f/2.0 aperture and it did an okay job in daylight. Selfies turned out a little soft for our liking but colours were good and HDR worked really well when shooting against the light. There's Live Focus here too, but edge detection isn't as good. In low-light, selfies lacked good detail, with visible grain. The Galaxy A30 can shoot up to full-HD videos with good quality, but the lack of stabilisation is disappointing. Unless you're staying still, videos often end up looking shaky and unusable. Continuous autofocus isn't very quick, and we saw visible lag when the camera was trying to refocus onto another subject. You can shoot video with the wide-angle camera too, but details are low, there's no stabilisation, and footage looks grainy in low-light. The camera app also has AR Emojis which are fun to play around with. The 4000mAh battery is one of the Galaxy A30's strong suits. It lasted for a good 15 hours and 8 minutes in our battery loop test, which is well above average. With day-to-day usage, which typically involved a few calls, some gaming, and using chat and social apps, we easily managed to push past a full day on one charge. The bundled fast charger is able to take the battery to about 70 percent in an hour, which is not bad at all. VerdictSamsung's new strategy seems to be throwing everything at consumers and seeing what sticks. Unfortunately, we don't think the Galaxy A30 is the most successful of its many recent launches. Other than the good battery life, Super AMOLED display and decent build quality, there's not much that stands out at its price tag of Rs. 16,990. The 6GB RAM variant of Galaxy M30 that is available for just Rs. 1,000 more offers slightly better camera performance, a bigger battery, and more RAM, and storage despite running an older version of Android. Or you could save Rs. 2,000 and get the 4GB/ 64GB variant of the Galaxy M30. The processor in the Galaxy A30 just isn't competitive enough at this price, when you have phones such as a the Oppo K1 (Review) and the Redmi Note 7 Pro (Review) that offer much better app and gaming performance. The cameras on the Galaxy A30 are another let-down. They take passable images under good light, but performance is severely lacking in low light. All in all, in our opinion, Samsung's own Galaxy M30 offers better value than the Galaxy A30. If you or looking for a more powerful option, you can consider the likes of Oppo K1 and Xiaomi's Redmi Note 7 Pro."
2439,21,samsung-galaxy-a50-review-2004033,8,10,2019-03-08,2004033,Jamshed Avari,Samsung Galaxy A50 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/samsung-galaxy-a50-review-2004033," Samsung completely lost its grip over the budget market in the past few years as Chinese rivals, most notably Xiaomi, swooped in. These companies continue to release model after model with each new generation bringing even more incredible features and specifications to every price point. Finally, Samsung has decided to strike back with its new M-series and the reimagined A-series. In just the past month or so, the company has launched six new low-cost models with enough variants to strike ten major price points between Rs. 7,990 and Rs. 22,990. We liked what we saw from the Galaxy M10 (Review) and Galaxy M20 (Review), for the most part. As the first two models of this new wave, these phones set the pace with a number of hot features including large screens with waterdrop notches, generous amounts of RAM and storage, multiple cameras, and large batteries. Now, the newly repositioned A-series overlaps with the M-series at the low end of the market with prices starting at Rs. 8,490. This formerly premium sub-brand used to be second only to the Galaxy S and Note lines with prices usually in the Rs. 20,000 to 40,000 range. The newly announced Galaxy A10, Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A50 do strongly resemble the Galaxy M10, Galaxy M20 and Galaxy M30, but at each tier they add a few conveniences and premium features that buyers might consider stepping up to. Today, we're reviewing the new top-of-the-line Samsung Galaxy A50. It promises quite a few features that could tempt buyers, including an in-display fingerprint sensor and three rear cameras, but at a higher price than any of the current M-series models. Let's get started.    The main attraction of the Galaxy A50 is its 6.4-inch Super AMOLED screen. This is the same size and panel type used on the Galaxy A30 and the recently launched Galaxy M30. All three models also have the same scoop-shaped Infinity-U notch. Samsung has done well to try and trim the borders around the screen, and the rounded corners and 91.6 percent screen-to-body ratio are very in keeping with current trends. There is still a noticeable chin, but the look is pretty slick overall for a relatively low-cost phone – the Galaxy A50 makes even the very recently released Galaxy A9 (2018) (Review) look old-school. One feature that is exclusive to the Galaxy A50 is the in-display fingerprint sensor. Unfortunately it isn't the same ultrasonic sensor that the company has used in the flagship Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ (Review), but that would have been expecting far too much at this price point. It's something that users will love showing off and could be a big selling point in this price segment, but we'll talk about it more later in this review. Samsung has not stated exactly what material the rear of this phone is made of, but it feels like plastic or polycarbonate. The panel curves slightly to meet the metal rim and there are no sharp edges anywhere. There are three colour options – black, white, and blue. A coral pink version shown off at MWC 2019 has not been launched in India, at least not yet. The rear panel of our black review unit was more like a translucent grey with an irredescent quality to it that makes light refract into rainbow patterns. You'll see this especially at the edges of the phone when you move it around under strong light. Unfortunately the surface is very glossy and so it gets completely smudged pretty much the moment you touch it. After using our review unit very carefully with its bundled plastic case for a few days, we still noticed a few tiny little scratches.    The vertically stacked triple camera module in the upper left corner sticks out just a little bit. This is one design touch that has carried over from previous models, most notably the Galaxy A7 (2018) (Review). There's an LED flash right below the cameras, and if you look very closely you'll see a faint Samsung logo and some regulatory text on the rear of the Galaxy A50 as well. The power and volume buttons on the right are reasonably within reach, and there's a USB Type-C port as well as a 3.5mm headphones socket and a speaker grille on the bottom. The dual-SIM tray with its dedicated microSD card slot is on the upper left. Some buyers will be disappointed that there's no room for a notification LED on the front of this phone but the Super AMOLED panel supports an always-on mode so you can still check notifications and alerts at a glance. By default, you have to tap the screen lightly to show this information but you can enable a true always-on mode from within the Settings app. As far as comfort goes, the Galaxy A50 is quite easy to use and doesn't feel too heavy or thick at all. It fits nicely in one hand and isn't slippery. Reaching all corners of the screen with one thumb is a bit of a stretch, but it wasn't uncomfortable for us. We think anyone who buys this phone will be happy with how it looks and feels. The Galaxy M10 and M20 were criticised by some of our readers for their bare-bones retail packages, and Samsung seems to have heard them. The slightly more premium Galaxy A50's retail box does include a headset and a plastic slip case in addition to a SIM eject pin, 15W charger, and USB Type-C cable (the latter two in black, interestingly).    It's a little difficult to differentiate all the Galaxy M-series and A-series models and variants. The Galaxy A50 has a 6.4-inch full-HD+ 1080x2340-pixel Super AMOLED panel which is shared with some of its siblings, as we've pointed out, but its octa-core Samsung Exynos 9610 SoC is a cut above the Exynos 7904 that the others use. This chip has four ARM Cortex-A73 and four Cortex A-53 CPU cores running at up to 2.3GHz and 1.6GHz respectively, to balance processing power and battery efficiency, along with a modern ARM Mali-G72 MP3 GPU. Samsung touts this SoC's image signal processor and support for deep learning algorithms to power features like single-camera depth sensing and face recognition. There are two variants of the Galaxy A50, and the only difference between them is RAM. You can choose between 4GB and 6GB, but storage is the same at 64GB between the two, at least for the options launched in India as of now. This is a bit of a surprise, especially considering that the less expensive Galaxy M30 has a 128GB option (and both models have the same price gap of Rs. 3,000 between variants). Incidentally, 128GB was listed as an option when the Galaxy A50 was first unveiled at MWC 2019, so other countries might still get better specs. The 4000mAh battery is smaller than the 5000mAh unit that the Galaxy M30 has. These factors might confuse buyers a bit. You also get Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, FM radio, LTE and VoLTE on both SIMs, and the usual sensors. It's very interesting that while the Galaxy M-series ships with Android 8.1 and Samsung's older Experience UI skin, the very similar Galaxy A50 runs Android 9 with the new One UI. This is good news, since users won't have to wait an unknown amount of time to get a major update. During our review period, we received an update to the February 2019 Android security patch. One UI is generally an improvement in terms of design, and it does look quite modern. Samsung says it has focused on usability on phones with large screens, but what that means is it has reduced information density throughout and made text and icons everywhere enormous, with loads of padding between elements. Some things, such as the quick settings panel, are now oversized so that icons are closer to the bottom of the screen where your thumbs are likely to be. It takes a bit of time to get used to. In some instances, it can feel as though screen space is being wasted, but on the other hand there are super useful touches like the Back button in the Settings app coming down within reach as you scroll rather than being anchored to the top-left corner of the screen. We found that we were happier increasing the density of the icon grids for the home screens and the app drawer and reducing the default text size. You can disable the app drawer and also choose whether to open it with a swipe or by tapping an icon. An optional swipe downwards anywhere on the home screen can pull down the notifications shade. There are several customisation options within various sub-menus of the Settings app that are well worth digging to find. (L-R) Quick settings toggles in the notification shade are moved lower to be within reach; replying to a text message in a pop-up window; multiple background effects in Live Focus mode   Night Mode is a dark theme, not the usual blue light filter (which is also still there). You can have it on all the time, schedule it, or sync it to sunrise and sunset for each day. You can reorder the Android navigation buttons or hide them and use swipe gestures instead (though Android 9's swipeable Home button isn't an option). FaceWidgets are useful lock screen modules for things like music controls, a calendar schedule overview, and the weather, and they'll stay visible on the always-on screen if you choose. Some of Samsung's wallpapers appear to have been designed deliberately to cover up the camera notch at the top. Samsung's Themes app is one of a few that ask for permission before sending you spammy notifications. There are loads of free and paid themes that you can download. There are a few handy gestures including one that captures a screenshot if you swipe inwards from either side of the screen using the edge of your palm. You can have message alerts show up as bubbles, and tapping them will open the respective app in a floating window so you can see the whole thread while typing a response. Google's Digital Wellbeing feature for Android 9 is also supported so you can see detailed app usage statistics, have the Galaxy A50 prompt you when it's time to wind down for the night, and impose time constraints on individual apps to help yourself focus. The Bixby assistant can bet set to trigger with a long-press of the power button, should you choose to use it. There's also Samsung Pay Mini for UPI money transactions. We had a huge problem with spammy notifications and ads on the lock screen with the Galaxy M-series. This is still an issue with the Galaxy A50, although the initial setup process does let you choose to disable “lock screen stories”. The default Samsung apps are still spammy and now there's Amazon Shopping in addition to Dailyhunt, several of Samsung's own apps, Microsoft Office and LinkedIn, and of course Google's apps. Shortly after getting started with our device we were tricked into tapping a notification asking us to complete the setup process. This turned out to be from a background app called IronSource which sneakily installed six spammy and unnecessary apps – these were Calculator, myTuner Radio and Flashlight (the phone already has these functions), HotSpotShield VPN, ShareChat, and Candy Crush Saga. Needless to say, even the dead-simple Flashlight app showed multiple ads including full-screen interstitials blocking the one toggle button on screen – its sole function. This is a continuing disappointment.    Samsung is heavily promoting the Galaxy A50's Super AMOLED screen and it really is crisp, bright and vibrant. Blacks are deep and colours really pop, but without being oversaturated. Everything looks great, right from the UI to videos and games. The always-on display feature is nice to have, and you can set up a schedule so it doesn't annoy you at night. As for sound quality, this phone's single speaker can get very loud but isn't very clear. Music and voices are grating at high volumes, and while you can use it for the occasional video clip, don't expect to enjoy a full movie. The included headset isn't very comfortable, and the large Y-splitter dangled just below our right ear, leaving the long wire to the left earbud bunching up around our chin. Sound isn't too bad, but highs are a bit shrill and there's barely any bass. The open design lets a lot of background noise in and broadcasts whatever you're listening to for people around you to hear. We would much rather use our own budget earphones. The in-display fingerprint sensor will be a big draw for a lot of people, but it does have its downsides. Recognition is fairly slow, and it often took two seconds or more for the phone to unlock itself, which is just enough to be mildly irritating. You can actually unlock the phone with even when it's in standby, but it will take trial and error to learn exactly where to place your finger. A single tap will light up the spot you need to hit, which might actually save you some time. We didn't have trouble with accuracy but recognition can fail if you don't touch the sensor long enough. There's also face recognition, which can be a lot quicker. You can choose to activate the front camera as soon as you raise the phone. It's more fluid and you don't have to wait for visual confirmation that it has worked. General day-to-day usage was fine, with no hiccups or slowdowns. Our review unit was the version with 4GB of RAM and were were happy, but you might want to spend the Rs. 3,000 more for the 6GB RAM variant if think you'll hang on to this phone for many years. There were ads in some Samsung apps and spammy notifications to deal with, but beyond that, our time using the Galaxy A50 was pleasant. We played PUBG Mobile and Asphalt 9: Legends at their high settings and weren't disappointed.    The Exynos 9610 processor isn't setting any records but it's competent for this price level. Benchmark tests showed performance in line with most of our current picks for the best phones under Rs. 20,000, though several of these options cost way less. AnTuTu gave us a score of 145,408 and Geekbench's single-core and multi-score test results were 1,719 and 5,586 respectively. 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme score was 1,269, and we also got 37fps and 22fps in GFXBench's T-rex and Manhattan tests respectively. Battery life can easily stretch to a day and a half with normal use. We took lots of photos and videos, streamed a movie, played a few games, and surfed the Web throughout the day. We started in the morning, and had about 30 percent left at night. Our HD video loop test ran for 14 hours, 59 minutes which is quite good. The included charger took us up from zero to 11 percent in about 10 minutes, and 30 percent in 30 minutes. The Samsung Galaxy A50 does boast of a lot of photography features, staring with the triple-camera module on the rear. The primary camera has a 25-megapixel sensor and f/1.7 aperture; the secondary camera is for wide shots and has an 8-megapixel sensor with a 123-degree field of view and f/2.2 aperture; and the third one is a standard 5-megapixel depth sensor. The single front-facing camera has a 25-megpixel sensor and f/2.0 aperture. Samsung also touts a Live Focus mode for portraits, a 480fps 720p slow-motion video mode, Hyper-Lapse mode for timelapse videos, AR emojis, and intelligent scene optimisation. The Pro mode is disappointing with only metering, ISO, white balance, and exposure compensation controls. You can switch between the standard and wide-angle cameras before you begin shooting videos, but not while recording. Samsung Galaxy A50 standard camera (above) and wide-angle camera (below). Tap to see full-sized images.   You can change the type of background blur in portrait shots from the standard bokeh to assorted filter effects, and there's even a fake dolly-zoom effect that you can make GIFs out of. Sadly, this only separates the background and zooms it in and out, without the distinctive perspective warping effect of a camera's field of view changing in motion. Edge detection was quite good, but the background between our subjects' torsos and arms was not identified. The app is easy to use and is pretty much the same as what we've seen on previous Samsung phones including the Galaxy A9 (2018). It's well laid out with useful controls within reach. You can choose whether the app remembers the mode you were using last, and enable a floating shutter button if you often find the usual one out of reach. The Galaxy A50 supports the high-efficiency HEIF and HEVC formats for photos and videos, but these are not enabled by default. Video recording with the front and rear cameras only goes up to 2336x1080 (full-HD but extended in width to match the aspect ratio of the phone's display). We were generally happy with the photos that the Galaxy A50 took. It tended to overexpose brightly lit parts of a frame in the daytime, but most of our photos came out looking good with quite a lot of detail. The wide-angle camera gives you a lot of flexibility and it's actually quite surprising how much more you can fit into a frame when standing in exactly the same spot, but quality is definitely lower and there's major distortion that isn't just limited to the edges of the frame. Tap to see full-sized Samsung Galaxy A50 camera samples   Performance at night was decent, but not great. Photos might look good on the phone's own screen and when posted online, but they don't really hold up when examined at full size. There can be some motion blurring due to the shutter staying open a bit too long. If there's enough light around, close-ups taken at night are fairly good. Videos shot while we were standing still came out looking great, with none of the focus hunting or wobbling that affects lower-end phone cameras. In the daytime, motion was crisp and details were good. The wide-angle camera gives everything a fish-eye effect and video is slightly darker but still smooth. There's no official mention of video stabilisation but we found that footage was still very usable. At night, things were a lot shakier and videos did not have much detail. The secondary camera produced dark, blotchy video. The front camera also has a Live Focus mode but without the effects. You can still change the blur intensity after taking a shot, but edge detection isn't great. The default beautification makes shots look quite artificial, and turning it off requires multiple taps. Samsung Galaxy A50 in pictures   VerdictUnfortunately for Samsung, the Galaxy A50 with its starting price of Rs. 19,990 competes with Xiaomi's Poco F1 (Review) which features the top-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor. That's obviously the better choice of phone if you're a gamer or want the smoothest possible experience, but it doesn't have three rear cameras or a modern all-screen design. As aggressive as Samsung is, it has been rather upstaged by the brand new Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro with its Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 SoC, 48-megapixel primary camera, Gorilla Glass 5, and other impressive specifications. The Redmi Note 7 Pro has a starting price of Rs. 13,999 and even the higher-end variant at Rs. 16,999 (with 128GB of storage) undercuts Samsung dramatically.  Another big competitor to the Samsung Galaxy A50 will be the company's own Galaxy M30, which has the same screen and a larger battery, but a weaker processor, standard fingerprint sensor, and a less flashy rear panel. If you aren't too fussed about camera quality, the Galaxy M30 starts for Rs. 5,000 less.  Even with these alternatives in the market, we think a lot of people will find the Galaxy A50 interesting enough to consider seriously. It has all the current-day features that you'd want to show off, and there are no major problems. We think there's scope for improvement with the cameras and software, but overall, Samsung is really showing that it knows how to bring the fight back."
2439,21,samsung-galaxy-a50-review-2004033,8,10,2019-03-08,2004033,Jamshed Avari,Samsung Galaxy A50 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/samsung-galaxy-a50-review-2004033," Samsung completely lost its grip over the budget market in the past few years as Chinese rivals, most notably Xiaomi, swooped in. These companies continue to release model after model with each new generation bringing even more incredible features and specifications to every price point. Finally, Samsung has decided to strike back with its new M-series and the reimagined A-series. In just the past month or so, the company has launched six new low-cost models with enough variants to strike ten major price points between Rs. 7,990 and Rs. 22,990. We liked what we saw from the Galaxy M10 (Review) and Galaxy M20 (Review), for the most part. As the first two models of this new wave, these phones set the pace with a number of hot features including large screens with waterdrop notches, generous amounts of RAM and storage, multiple cameras, and large batteries. Now, the newly repositioned A-series overlaps with the M-series at the low end of the market with prices starting at Rs. 8,490. This formerly premium sub-brand used to be second only to the Galaxy S and Note lines with prices usually in the Rs. 20,000 to 40,000 range. The newly announced Galaxy A10, Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A50 do strongly resemble the Galaxy M10, Galaxy M20 and Galaxy M30, but at each tier they add a few conveniences and premium features that buyers might consider stepping up to. Today, we're reviewing the new top-of-the-line Samsung Galaxy A50. It promises quite a few features that could tempt buyers, including an in-display fingerprint sensor and three rear cameras, but at a higher price than any of the current M-series models. Let's get started.    The main attraction of the Galaxy A50 is its 6.4-inch Super AMOLED screen. This is the same size and panel type used on the Galaxy A30 and the recently launched Galaxy M30. All three models also have the same scoop-shaped Infinity-U notch. Samsung has done well to try and trim the borders around the screen, and the rounded corners and 91.6 percent screen-to-body ratio are very in keeping with current trends. There is still a noticeable chin, but the look is pretty slick overall for a relatively low-cost phone – the Galaxy A50 makes even the very recently released Galaxy A9 (2018) (Review) look old-school. One feature that is exclusive to the Galaxy A50 is the in-display fingerprint sensor. Unfortunately it isn't the same ultrasonic sensor that the company has used in the flagship Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ (Review), but that would have been expecting far too much at this price point. It's something that users will love showing off and could be a big selling point in this price segment, but we'll talk about it more later in this review. Samsung has not stated exactly what material the rear of this phone is made of, but it feels like plastic or polycarbonate. The panel curves slightly to meet the metal rim and there are no sharp edges anywhere. There are three colour options – black, white, and blue. A coral pink version shown off at MWC 2019 has not been launched in India, at least not yet. The rear panel of our black review unit was more like a translucent grey with an irredescent quality to it that makes light refract into rainbow patterns. You'll see this especially at the edges of the phone when you move it around under strong light. Unfortunately the surface is very glossy and so it gets completely smudged pretty much the moment you touch it. After using our review unit very carefully with its bundled plastic case for a few days, we still noticed a few tiny little scratches.    The vertically stacked triple camera module in the upper left corner sticks out just a little bit. This is one design touch that has carried over from previous models, most notably the Galaxy A7 (2018) (Review). There's an LED flash right below the cameras, and if you look very closely you'll see a faint Samsung logo and some regulatory text on the rear of the Galaxy A50 as well. The power and volume buttons on the right are reasonably within reach, and there's a USB Type-C port as well as a 3.5mm headphones socket and a speaker grille on the bottom. The dual-SIM tray with its dedicated microSD card slot is on the upper left. Some buyers will be disappointed that there's no room for a notification LED on the front of this phone but the Super AMOLED panel supports an always-on mode so you can still check notifications and alerts at a glance. By default, you have to tap the screen lightly to show this information but you can enable a true always-on mode from within the Settings app. As far as comfort goes, the Galaxy A50 is quite easy to use and doesn't feel too heavy or thick at all. It fits nicely in one hand and isn't slippery. Reaching all corners of the screen with one thumb is a bit of a stretch, but it wasn't uncomfortable for us. We think anyone who buys this phone will be happy with how it looks and feels. The Galaxy M10 and M20 were criticised by some of our readers for their bare-bones retail packages, and Samsung seems to have heard them. The slightly more premium Galaxy A50's retail box does include a headset and a plastic slip case in addition to a SIM eject pin, 15W charger, and USB Type-C cable (the latter two in black, interestingly).    It's a little difficult to differentiate all the Galaxy M-series and A-series models and variants. The Galaxy A50 has a 6.4-inch full-HD+ 1080x2340-pixel Super AMOLED panel which is shared with some of its siblings, as we've pointed out, but its octa-core Samsung Exynos 9610 SoC is a cut above the Exynos 7904 that the others use. This chip has four ARM Cortex-A73 and four Cortex A-53 CPU cores running at up to 2.3GHz and 1.6GHz respectively, to balance processing power and battery efficiency, along with a modern ARM Mali-G72 MP3 GPU. Samsung touts this SoC's image signal processor and support for deep learning algorithms to power features like single-camera depth sensing and face recognition. There are two variants of the Galaxy A50, and the only difference between them is RAM. You can choose between 4GB and 6GB, but storage is the same at 64GB between the two, at least for the options launched in India as of now. This is a bit of a surprise, especially considering that the less expensive Galaxy M30 has a 128GB option (and both models have the same price gap of Rs. 3,000 between variants). Incidentally, 128GB was listed as an option when the Galaxy A50 was first unveiled at MWC 2019, so other countries might still get better specs. The 4000mAh battery is smaller than the 5000mAh unit that the Galaxy M30 has. These factors might confuse buyers a bit. You also get Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, FM radio, LTE and VoLTE on both SIMs, and the usual sensors. It's very interesting that while the Galaxy M-series ships with Android 8.1 and Samsung's older Experience UI skin, the very similar Galaxy A50 runs Android 9 with the new One UI.

2439,21,samsung-galaxy-a50-review-2004033,8,10,2019-03-08,2004033,Jamshed Avari,Samsung Galaxy A50 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/samsung-galaxy-a50-review-2004033," Samsung completely lost its grip over the budget market in the past few years as Chinese rivals, most notably Xiaomi, swooped in. These companies continue to release model after model with each new generation bringing even more incredible features and specifications to every price point. Finally, Samsung has decided to strike back with its new M-series and the reimagined A-series. In just the past month or so, the company has launched six new low-cost models with enough variants to strike ten major price points between Rs. 7,990 and Rs. 22,990. We liked what we saw from the Galaxy M10 (Review) and Galaxy M20 (Review), for the most part. As the first two models of this new wave, these phones set the pace with a number of hot features including large screens with waterdrop notches, generous amounts of RAM and storage, multiple cameras, and large batteries. Now, the newly repositioned A-series overlaps with the M-series at the low end of the market with prices starting at Rs. 8,490. This formerly premium sub-brand used to be second only to the Galaxy S and Note lines with prices usually in the Rs. 20,000 to 40,000 range. The newly announced Galaxy A10, Galaxy A30 and Galaxy A50 do strongly resemble the Galaxy M10, Galaxy M20 and Galaxy M30, but at each tier they add a few conveniences and premium features that buyers might consider stepping up to. Today, we're reviewing the new top-of-the-line Samsung Galaxy A50. It promises quite a few features that could tempt buyers, including an in-display fingerprint sensor and three rear cameras, but at a higher price than any of the current M-series models. Let's get started.    The main attraction of the Galaxy A50 is its 6.4-inch Super AMOLED screen. This is the same size and panel type used on the Galaxy A30 and the recently launched Galaxy M30. All three models also have the same scoop-shaped Infinity-U notch. Samsung has done well to try and trim the borders around the screen, and the rounded corners and 91.6 percent screen-to-body ratio are very in keeping with current trends. There is still a noticeable chin, but the look is pretty slick overall for a relatively low-cost phone – the Galaxy A50 makes even the very recently released Galaxy A9 (2018) (Review) look old-school. One feature that is exclusive to the Galaxy A50 is the in-display fingerprint sensor. Unfortunately it isn't the same ultrasonic sensor that the company has used in the flagship Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ (Review), but that would have been expecting far too much at this price point. It's something that users will love showing off and could be a big selling point in this price segment, but we'll talk about it more later in this review. Samsung has not stated exactly what material the rear of this phone is made of, but it feels like plastic or polycarbonate. The panel curves slightly to meet the metal rim and there are no sharp edges anywhere. There are three colour options – black, white, and blue. A coral pink version shown off at MWC 2019 has not been launched in India, at least not yet. The rear panel of our black review unit was more like a translucent grey with an irredescent quality to it that makes light refract into rainbow patterns. You'll see this especially at the edges of the phone when you move it around under strong light. Unfortunately the surface is very glossy and so it gets completely smudged pretty much the moment you touch it. After using our review unit very carefully with its bundled plastic case for a few days, we still noticed a few tiny little scratches.    The vertically stacked triple camera module in the upper left corner sticks out just a little bit. This is one design touch that has carried over from previous models, most notably the Galaxy A7 (2018) (Review). There's an LED flash right below the cameras, and if you look very closely you'll see a faint Samsung logo and some regulatory text on the rear of the Galaxy A50 as well. The power and volume buttons on the right are reasonably within reach, and there's a USB Type-C port as well as a 3.5mm headphones socket and a speaker grille on the bottom. The dual-SIM tray with its dedicated microSD card slot is on the upper left. Some buyers will be disappointed that there's no room for a notification LED on the front of this phone but the Super AMOLED panel supports an always-on mode so you can still check notifications and alerts at a glance. By default, you have to tap the screen lightly to show this information but you can enable a true always-on mode from within the Settings app. As far as comfort goes, the Galaxy A50 is quite easy to use and doesn't feel too heavy or thick at all. It fits nicely in one hand and isn't slippery. Reaching all corners of the screen with one thumb is a bit of a stretch, but it wasn't uncomfortable for us. We think anyone who buys this phone will be happy with how it looks and feels. The Galaxy M10 and M20 were criticised by some of our readers for their bare-bones retail packages, and Samsung seems to have heard them. The slightly more premium Galaxy A50's retail box does include a headset and a plastic slip case in addition to a SIM eject pin, 15W charger, and USB Type-C cable (the latter two in black, interestingly).    It's a little difficult to differentiate all the Galaxy M-series and A-series models and variants. The Galaxy A50 has a 6.4-inch full-HD+ 1080x2340-pixel Super AMOLED panel which is shared with some of its siblings, as we've pointed out, but its octa-core Samsung Exynos 9610 SoC is a cut above the Exynos 7904 that the others use. This chip has four ARM Cortex-A73 and four Cortex A-53 CPU cores running at up to 2.3GHz and 1.6GHz respectively, to balance processing power and battery efficiency, along with a modern ARM Mali-G72 MP3 GPU. Samsung touts this SoC's image signal processor and support for deep learning algorithms to power features like single-camera depth sensing and face recognition. There are two variants of the Galaxy A50, and the only difference between them is RAM. You can choose between 4GB and 6GB, but storage is the same at 64GB between the two, at least for the options launched in India as of now. This is a bit of a surprise, especially considering that the less expensive Galaxy M30 has a 128GB option (and both models have the same price gap of Rs. 3,000 between variants). Incidentally, 128GB was listed as an option when the Galaxy A50 was first unveiled at MWC 2019, so other countries might still get better specs. The 4000mAh battery is smaller than the 5000mAh unit that the Galaxy M30 has. These factors might confuse buyers a bit. You also get Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, FM radio, LTE and VoLTE on both SIMs, and the usual sensors. It's very interesting that while the Galaxy M-series ships with Android 8.1 and Samsung's older Experience UI skin, the very similar Galaxy A50 runs Android 9 with the new One UI. This is good news, since users won't have to wait an unknown amount of time to get a major update. During our review period, we received an update to the February 2019 Android security patch. One UI is generally an improvement in terms of design, and it does look quite modern. Samsung says it has focused on usability on phones with large screens, but what that means is it has reduced information density throughout and made text and icons everywhere enormous, with loads of padding between elements. Some things, such as the quick settings panel, are now oversized so that icons are closer to the bottom of the screen where your thumbs are likely to be. It takes a bit of time to get used to. In some instances, it can feel as though screen space is being wasted, but on the other hand there are super useful touches like the Back button in the Settings app coming down within reach as you scroll rather than being anchored to the top-left corner of the screen. We found that we were happier increasing the density of the icon grids for the home screens and the app drawer and reducing the default text size. You can disable the app drawer and also choose whether to open it with a swipe or by tapping an icon. An optional swipe downwards anywhere on the home screen can pull down the notifications shade. There are several customisation options within various sub-menus of the Settings app that are well worth digging to find. (L-R) Quick settings toggles in the notification shade are moved lower to be within reach; replying to a text message in a pop-up window; multiple background effects in Live Focus mode   Night Mode is a dark theme, not the usual blue light filter (which is also still there). You can have it on all the time, schedule it, or sync it to sunrise and sunset for each day. You can reorder the Android navigation buttons or hide them and use swipe gestures instead (though Android 9's swipeable Home button isn't an option). FaceWidgets are useful lock screen modules for things like music controls, a calendar schedule overview, and the weather, and they'll stay visible on the always-on screen if you choose. Some of Samsung's wallpapers appear to have been designed deliberately to cover up the camera notch at the top. Samsung's Themes app is one of a few that ask for permission before sending you spammy notifications. There are loads of free and paid themes that you can download. There are a few handy gestures including one that captures a screenshot if you swipe inwards from either side of the screen using the edge of your palm. You can have message alerts show up as bubbles, and tapping them will open the respective app in a floating window so you can see the whole thread while typing a response. Google's Digital Wellbeing feature for Android 9 is also supported so you can see detailed app usage statistics, have the Galaxy A50 prompt you when it's time to wind down for the night, and impose time constraints on individual apps to help yourself focus. The Bixby assistant can bet set to trigger with a long-press of the power button, should you choose to use it. There's also Samsung Pay Mini for UPI money transactions. We had a huge problem with spammy notifications and ads on the lock screen with the Galaxy M-series. This is still an issue with the Galaxy A50, although the initial setup process does let you choose to disable “lock screen stories”. The default Samsung apps are still spammy and now there's Amazon Shopping in addition to Dailyhunt, several of Samsung's own apps, Microsoft Office and LinkedIn, and of course Google's apps. Shortly after getting started with our device we were tricked into tapping a notification asking us to complete the setup process. This turned out to be from a background app called IronSource which sneakily installed six spammy and unnecessary apps – these were Calculator, myTuner Radio and Flashlight (the phone already has these functions), HotSpotShield VPN, ShareChat, and Candy Crush Saga. Needless to say, even the dead-simple Flashlight app showed multiple ads including full-screen interstitials blocking the one toggle button on screen – its sole function. This is a continuing disappointment.    Samsung is heavily promoting the Galaxy A50's Super AMOLED screen and it really is crisp, bright and vibrant. Blacks are deep and colours really pop, but without being oversaturated. Everything looks great, right from the UI to videos and games. The always-on display feature is nice to have, and you can set up a schedule so it doesn't annoy you at night. As for sound quality, this phone's single speaker can get very loud but isn't very clear. Music and voices are grating at high volumes, and while you can use it for the occasional video clip, don't expect to enjoy a full movie. The included headset isn't very comfortable, and the large Y-splitter dangled just below our right ear, leaving the long wire to the left earbud bunching up around our chin. Sound isn't too bad, but highs are a bit shrill and there's barely any bass. The open design lets a lot of background noise in and broadcasts whatever you're listening to for people around you to hear. We would much rather use our own budget earphones. The in-display fingerprint sensor will be a big draw for a lot of people, but it does have its downsides. Recognition is fairly slow, and it often took two seconds or more for the phone to unlock itself, which is just enough to be mildly irritating. You can actually unlock the phone with even when it's in standby, but it will take trial and error to learn exactly where to place your finger. A single tap will light up the spot you need to hit, which might actually save you some time. We didn't have trouble with accuracy but recognition can fail if you don't touch the sensor long enough. There's also face recognition, which can be a lot quicker. You can choose to activate the front camera as soon as you raise the phone. It's more fluid and you don't have to wait for visual confirmation that it has worked. General day-to-day usage was fine, with no hiccups or slowdowns. Our review unit was the version with 4GB of RAM and were were happy, but you might want to spend the Rs. 3,000 more for the 6GB RAM variant if think you'll hang on to this phone for many years. There were ads in some Samsung apps and spammy notifications to deal with, but beyond that, our time using the Galaxy A50 was pleasant. We played PUBG Mobile and Asphalt 9: Legends at their high settings and weren't disappointed.    The Exynos 9610 processor isn't setting any records but it's competent for this price level. Benchmark tests showed performance in line with most of our current picks for the best phones under Rs. 20,000, though several of these options cost way less. AnTuTu gave us a score of 145,408 and Geekbench's single-core and multi-score test results were 1,719 and 5,586 respectively. 3DMark's Sling Shot Extreme score was 1,269, and we also got 37fps and 22fps in GFXBench's T-rex and Manhattan tests respectively. Battery life can easily stretch to a day and a half with normal use. We took lots of photos and videos, streamed a movie, played a few games, and surfed the Web throughout the day. We started in the morning, and had about 30 percent left at night. Our HD video loop test ran for 14 hours, 59 minutes which is quite good. The included charger took us up from zero to 11 percent in about 10 minutes, and 30 percent in 30 minutes. The Samsung Galaxy A50 does boast of a lot of photography features, staring with the triple-camera module on the rear. The primary camera has a 25-megapixel sensor and f/1.7 aperture; the secondary camera is for wide shots and has an 8-megapixel sensor with a 123-degree field of view and f/2.2 aperture; and the third one is a standard 5-megapixel depth sensor. The single front-facing camera has a 25-megpixel sensor and f/2.0 aperture. Samsung also touts a Live Focus mode for portraits, a 480fps 720p slow-motion video mode, Hyper-Lapse mode for timelapse videos, AR emojis, and intelligent scene optimisation. The Pro mode is disappointing with only metering, ISO, white balance, and exposure compensation controls. You can switch between the standard and wide-angle cameras before you begin shooting videos, but not while recording. Samsung Galaxy A50 standard camera (above) and wide-angle camera (below). Tap to see full-sized images.   You can change the type of background blur in portrait shots from the standard bokeh to assorted filter effects, and there's even a fake dolly-zoom effect that you can make GIFs out of. Sadly, this only separates the background and zooms it in and out, without the distinctive perspective warping effect of a camera's field of view changing in motion. Edge detection was quite good, but the background between our subjects' torsos and arms was not identified. The app is easy to use and is pretty much the same as what we've seen on previous Samsung phones including the Galaxy A9 (2018). It's well laid out with useful controls within reach. You can choose whether the app remembers the mode you were using last, and enable a floating shutter button if you often find the usual one out of reach. The Galaxy A50 supports the high-efficiency HEIF and HEVC formats for photos and videos, but these are not enabled by default. Video recording with the front and rear cameras only goes up to 2336x1080 (full-HD but extended in width to match the aspect ratio of the phone's display). We were generally happy with the photos that the Galaxy A50 took. It tended to overexpose brightly lit parts of a frame in the daytime, but most of our photos came out looking good with quite a lot of detail. The wide-angle camera gives you a lot of flexibility and it's actually quite surprising how much more you can fit into a frame when standing in exactly the same spot, but quality is definitely lower and there's major distortion that isn't just limited to the edges of the frame. Tap to see full-sized Samsung Galaxy A50 camera samples   Performance at night was decent, but not great. Photos might look good on the phone's own screen and when posted online, but they don't really hold up when examined at full size. There can be some motion blurring due to the shutter staying open a bit too long. If there's enough light around, close-ups taken at night are fairly good. Videos shot while we were standing still came out looking great, with none of the focus hunting or wobbling that affects lower-end phone cameras. In the daytime, motion was crisp and details were good. The wide-angle camera gives everything a fish-eye effect and video is slightly darker but still smooth. There's no official mention of video stabilisation but we found that footage was still very usable. At night, things were a lot shakier and videos did not have much detail. The secondary camera produced dark, blotchy video. The front camera also has a Live Focus mode but without the effects. You can still change the blur intensity after taking a shot, but edge detection isn't great. The default beautification makes shots look quite artificial, and turning it off requires multiple taps. Samsung Galaxy A50 in pictures   VerdictUnfortunately for Samsung, the Galaxy A50 with its starting price of Rs. 19,990 competes with Xiaomi's Poco F1 (Review) which features the top-end Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor. That's obviously the better choice of phone if you're a gamer or want the smoothest possible experience, but it doesn't have three rear cameras or a modern all-screen design. As aggressive as Samsung is, it has been rather upstaged by the brand new Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro with its Qualcomm Snapdragon 675 SoC, 48-megapixel primary camera, Gorilla Glass 5, and other impressive specifications. The Redmi Note 7 Pro has a starting price of Rs. 13,999 and even the higher-end variant at Rs. 16,999 (with 128GB of storage) undercuts Samsung dramatically.  Another big competitor to the Samsung Galaxy A50 will be the company's own Galaxy M30, which has the same screen and a larger battery, but a weaker processor, standard fingerprint sensor, and a less flashy rear panel. If you aren't too fussed about camera quality, the Galaxy M30 starts for Rs. 5,000 less.  Even with these alternatives in the market, we think a lot of people will find the Galaxy A50 interesting enough to consider seriously. It has all the current-day features that you'd want to show off, and there are no major problems. We think there's scope for improvement with the cameras and software, but overall, Samsung is really showing that it knows how to bring the fight back."
2156,21,samsung-galaxy-note-8-review-1752402,9,10,2017-09-21,1752402,Roydon Cerejo,Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-8-review-1752402," Samsung’s Galaxy Note series phones have set benchmarks for the company, featuring the absolute best it has to offer in terms of mobile technology. The big differentiating factor from the S series has been bigger screens and the  S-Pen stylus, and this formula has worked well for Samsung for years now. However, ever since the Galaxy S6 Edge+, the company has been fragmenting its S series too, offering multiple sizes, thereby slowly bridging the gap between the S and the Note series. The Note brand took a hit because of the fiasco that was the Galaxy Note 7, but clearly, Samsung loyalists weren’t going to let it fade into the history books. According to the company, The Note 8 has seen a record number of preorders and that demand has been equally strong in India too. Samsung has launched the Galaxy Note 8 in India at Rs. 67,900, which is merely Rs. 2,000 more than the price of the 6GB version of the Galaxy S8+ (Review). With barely any price difference between the two - though the S8+ is presently available at a discount - common sense would suggest grabbing the Note 8 over the S8+, but is that all there is to it? Are the dual cameras and S-Pen worth the weight and potential ergonomics trade-off? We find out.    The Galaxy Note 8 is more than just a slightly stretched Galaxy S8+. Its body is more rectangular and the curves at the corners are less pronounced. The metal frame on the sides is also thicker, with overall width rising to 8.6mm. This phone is also heavier at around 195 grams. However, the weight aside, we found it to be surprisingly easier to manage than the S8+. We’ve been using the latter for a long time now, and even with a silicone case, it’s still easy to handle. The Note 8's dimensions make it feel better to hold, and even without a case, we’ve yet to accidentally drop it. The Samsung Galaxy Note 8 feels robust and solid, but be prepared to the wipe the back every few minutes as the glass doesn’t seem to have the same level of smudge resistance as the front. Dominating the front is a 6.3-inch QHD+ Super AMOLED display, with narrow bezels on the top and bottom and nothing on the sides, so the glass is free to blend in with the metal frame. Button placement is good if you’re right-handed, as the power and volume buttons line up nicely. There’s also the dedicated Bixby button on the left, which should prove more useful now that Bixby Voice is also coming to India. The Samsung Galaxy S8+ (left) and Samsung Galaxy Note 8 (right) side by side The hybrid dual-SIM tray is placed on the top, which can accommodate either two Nano-SIMs or a single SIM and a microSD card (up to 256GB). At the bottom, we have the 3.5-mm headphone socket, USB Type-C connector, speaker grille, and a slot for the S-Pen. The Super AMOLED display is gorgeous and looks its best when you use it at its native resolution of 1440x2960. You’ll have to manually bump up the resolution as the default setting is Full-HD+. However, keep in mind that running games at the native resolution will cause a slight dip in performance, and the battery tends to drain a bit quicker as well. You can decide whether you want to pay this price. One thing we wish the phone did was automatically switch to ‘Game Mode’ when you launch a game from the Game Launcher app. That way, you could have everything else running at the highest resolution and have the phone automatically drop to Full-HD+ when you run a game. Currently, Game Mode needs to be triggered manually, which isn’t very ideal. The S-Pen that comes with the Galaxy Note 8 looks and feels a lot more premium than before. It weighs a mere 2.8 grams and features a finer tip. It’s also IP68 certified, just like the Note 8, and supports 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity. The S-Pen clicks in and out of its silo, and unlike the Note 5, it only goes in the right way so there’s no chance of it getting stuck or breaking the mechanism inside. We’ll cover all the functions of the S-Pen in just a bit.  Around the back, we have the dual 12-megapixel cameras, which is a big deal because it’s Samsung’s first-ever phone with this feature. Both cameras have optical stabilisation, which again, is quite rare. The heart-rate sensor and fingerprint sensor are placed beside the lenses. The Galaxy Note 8 ships with a Type-C cable, power adapter, AKG earphones, SIM ejector tool, extra pen nibs and a tweezer to insert them, a clear plastic case, a Micro-USB to Type-C adapter, and a USB Type-C to Type-A adapter. The bundled accessories are of very good quality, especially the headset. We didn’t find the case to be very useful as it diminishes the look of the phone, but your mileage may vary. The main specifications are similar to those of the Galaxy S8 and S8+. In India, we get the 10nm Exynos 9 Octa (8895) SoC along with 6GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 64GB of storage. UI and app performance is blazing fast and we didn't experience any slow-downs during the review period. However, a week’s worth of usage isn’t enough to judge that long-term, so we’ll have to see how it holds up over time. Benchmark numbers are similar to those of the S8+ (4GB). In AnTuTu, we got 173,680 points and 30,253 points in 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited. The phone is also loaded with an iris sensor in addition to the barometer and RGB light sensor. You also get dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 5, IP68 dust and water resistance, Cat 16 LTE, NFC, and GPS, though FM radio is missing. Just like the S8 series, the Note 8 also supports Samsung Pay for both, NFC and MST terminals. We’ve been using this feature for a while now and it works well pretty much everywhere.  Part of the reason that the Galaxy Note 8 feels so speedy is its software. This phone runs a more recent version of Samsung Experience (8.5 vs 8.1 on the S8+) which is based on a more current version of Android Nougat (7.1.1). It’s strange that Samsung hasn’t updated the software on the S8 and S8+ yet. We’ve covered all the features at great length in our S8+ review, so we’ll just skim over them here and focus on the S-Pen instead. Swiping right on the home screen takes you to Bixby, while Edge Panels give you quick access to contacts, music, apps, etc. You can even group two apps together add a combined shortcut to the Apps Edge so that they both open at the same time, in split-screen mode. If you have Samsung Pay, then you simply swipe up from the bottom of the screen to access your registered credit and debit cards. The only noticeable change in the Settings app is the addition of a section for the S-Pen features. Here you can toggle different functions like Air View, which gives you a pop-up or preview of images, extra menu information, etc. You can choose what action to take when the S-Pen is removed from its silo. By default, a little carousel automatically pops up from the edge of the phone giving you shortcuts to core S-Pen features. You can also add up to 10 of your own app shortcuts (like for drawing apps) to the carousel.  Create Note gives you a blank canvas with basic writing tools, and your creations are saved in the Samsung Notes app. However, using the Samsung Notes app directly gives you added functionality such as a ruled sheet, and the ability to add images and voice memos to your notes. Glance minimises any opened app to a small window; Bixby Vision lets you search for information about any object on the screen by hovering the S-Pen over it; Magnify does exactly what the name suggests. Smart Select lets you create a custom crop for anything on the screen, which can then be modified, saved as a note, or searched for online with Bixby Vision. Screen Write takes a screenshot and lets you scribble on it; Live Message lets you draw or write custom messages and save them as animated GIFs; and finally, Translate lets you select words to translate from one language to another. Live Message and Translate are pretty useful for everyday use. The Translate feature can handle English to Hindi, Gujarati, Bengali, Marathi, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu, and Urdu. Perhaps the most useful feature that we found is Screen Off Memo. You can take notes when the phone is in standby (up to 100 pages) and pin them to the Always-on Display. You can even go in and edit those notes later on. We ended up using this more than Google Keep, just because of its convenience. Even though you can take multiple notes and save them to the Notes app, only one can be pinned to the Always-on Display at a time. The Galaxy Note 8 ships with many several apps like Samsung’s Galaxy app store and Microsoft’s suite of Office apps. However, you can uninstall some redundant ones like Samsung’s custom Calendar app. You can also sign in to Samsung Cloud, which gives you 15GB of cloud storage for backing up contacts, photos, etc. The iris scanner is very quick at authentication, no matter the ambient lighting. In terms of day to day performance of the Galaxy Note 8, we didn't face any performance lags, and multitasking was very speedy. Apps also loaded quickly. We hope that the large amount of RAM will help sustain this fluid experience over the long run since we've heard first-hand reports of the 4GB version of the Galaxy S8+ developing slight lag and stutters after months of use.  The Galaxy Note 8 gets warm quickly when apps use GPS or the cameras, or when gaming, but not excessively so, not even after prolonged intensive usage. It also cools down just as fast. The S-Pen is a useful tool to have, even if you’re not really into any serious sketching. Apps like Autodesk Sketchbook, INKredible, and Bamboo Paper are some of the must-have free apps for the S-Pen. Samsung’s own Notes app is quite versatile, allowing you to take advantage of the pressure sensitivity of the stylus. Games like Scribble Racer are also more fun with the S-Pen. Your mileage will vary depending on your usage patterns. It can be a bit awkward at first to write comfortably when you're holding the phone, due to its taller proportions, but you get used to it after a bit. The large screen is ideal for watching videos. Colours are vivid and blacks are deep, which means that images and videos have very good contrast. You can also enable a video enhancer feature, which boosts brightness and colours for apps capable of video playback. High-resolution videos play flawlessly and the Note 8 is now officially supported by Netflix for HDR 10. The speaker gets loud but the stereo experience is missing. Thankfully, audio performance with the bundled AKG headset is superb. The earphones handle voice calls well and have a balanced sonic signature. Mids and highs are very detailed with ample kick in the low-end frequencies. They’re also extremely comfortable to wear even for long periods. Thanks to Bluetooth 5, the Note 8 can stream the same audio track to two wireless speakers at the same time. There’s also something called Separate App Sound, which can, for example, play music from Apple Music on a Bluetooth speaker, but make sure that other app alerts are heard only through the phone’s speaker. On paper, the primary camera is identical to the one on the Galaxy S8 models, and all shooting modes like Pro, Panorama, Slow Motion, Hyperlapse and Food are handled by this sensor. The second camera also has a 12-megapixel sensor but with smaller pixels and aperture (f/2.4). You get 2x optical zoom and a Live Focus feature. Thankfully, this sensor also gets OIS, so your zoomed-in shots don’t appear blurry. Tap for full sized Samsung Galaxy Note 8 camera samples Image quality with the main sensor is nothing short of amazing. Samsung seems to have dialled down the colours with this new firmware, so landscapes and close-ups don’t have exaggerated colours like they do with the S8 series. However, the colour tone is still on the warmer side. Focusing is extremely quick, even at night. The main sensor manages extremely detailed landscapes and detailed macros, with good natural depth of field thanks to the f/1.7 aperture. Even in low light, it manages excellent details and accurate colours. The 2x zoom is only available in the Auto shooting mode and standard video recording mode. Like most phones with dual cameras, the second sensor only kicks in if there’s sufficient light; otherwise you just get a digital zoom through the primary sensor and lens. The Live Focus feature works best on people. An onscreen message tells you when it is available. If there’s not enough light or something blocking the main sensor, you get alerts about this. In this mode, you can enable Dual Capture, which takes photos from both cameras so you can choose which frame you prefer later on. Video recording maxes out at 4K at 30fps, and there are other options like 1080p at 60fps and 720p at 240fps. Stabilisation is very good as long as you’re stationary and just panning around. However, if you begin walking, videos tend to have a slight ‘jelly’ effect around the edges of the frame. The same goes for the telephoto sensor too. The front 8-megapixel selfie camera also gets a f/1.7 aperture so low-light shots are pretty detailed. Battery capacity is reduced a bit compared to the Galaxy S8+, to 3300mAh. The smaller capacity battery could be due to the fact that Samsung had to make room for the S-Pen, and had to keep its size and weight manageable. The results were as expected. In our HD video loop test, we managed 12 hours and 43 minutes, which is slightly lower than what we got with the S8+. With regular use, the Note 8 nearly makes it a full day on a single charge but it’s tough to get anything more, even with frugal use. There’s fast charging which takes the phone from zero to about 37 percent in half an hour, and up to 79 percent in an hour. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 in pictures The launch price of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is Rs. 67,900, which makes it a no-brainier over the 6GB Galaxy S8+. However, it’s only a matter of time before Samsung permanently slashes the price of the S8 series in order to widen the gap between its two flagships. The Note 8 is yet another winner from Samsung. The S-Pen and the new dual camera system offer enough benefits to justify the premium over the S8+. This does come at a small cost of weight but honestly, that’s just a matter of getting used to. The Note 8 also gives you the added benefit of having the latest version of Samsung’s UI, over its S8 sibling. While this could change going ahead, the way we see it, the Note 8 might continue to get preferential treatment since it is a matter of prestige for Samsung. It will also give the company a chance to show its commitment to devoted fans. The only thing slightly disappointed about is battery life. We would typically expect a top-end phone to last an entire day at the very least, but that's tough to achieve here. Let’s not forget the competition. Apple’s iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X are incoming, and will be more expensive but will have their fans. Then, we have the Google Pixel XL 2, which should be unveiled on October 4 and LG might slip the V30 in before the holiday rush. All these launches in the next few months could have a positive impact on the Note 8’s pricing. Perhaps waiting a bit could be a good idea.  If you can’t wait a few months and have your heart set on an Android flagship, then the Galaxy Note 8 will not disappoint. It’s got fantastic build quality, excellent cameras, a gorgeous display, and a useful stylus that only Note devices can boast of."
2238,21,samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review-1824169,9,10,2018-03-16,1824169,Roydon Cerejo,Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/samsung-galaxy-s9-plus-review-1824169," Samsung's flagship smartphones, the Galaxy S and Galaxy Note series, play a pivotal role in the company’s ability to dominate global markets. Last year’s Galaxy S8, Galaxy S8+ and Galaxy Note 8 (Review) helped Samsung capture a big chunk of the global market in 2017, passing Apple along the way, and the company hopes to achieve even better results with its 2018 updates. The Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ have been launched in India very shortly after being announced globally at MWC 2018, for the same starting prices as last year’s models. This is good news for all those who were planning on picking either one up on launch day. The company has also made a bold move by increasing the disparity between the two models, so for buyers, it isn't just a case of choosing the display size and battery capacity that suit you better. The big question for us is how much better are the new Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ than their predecessors? If you're wondering whether you should bother upgrading, read on.    We begin with the design, which has gotten some minor improvements, but is still very similar to last year’s models for the most part. This is not a bad thing, considering that we loved the design of the Galaxy S8 series. You get the same premium blend of glass and metal. The Galaxy S9 is definitely easier to handle and live with due to its smaller footprint and lower weight, but both phones have the same thickness of 8.5mm. The exposed aluminium sides offer enough surface area to grip the Galaxy S9 when lifting it or when you’re on a call, but its front and back can be slippery. The Galaxy S9+ is definitely a handful in the literal sense, and is a little tough to manage with just one hand. Also, due to the near bezel-less design, we often had many accidental screen touches with the bigger model. The glass back lets you charge the phone wirelessly and also perform contactless payments through Samsung Pay. However, it’s a major fingerprint magnet. It doesn’t take much to get a lot of smudges on the back. The display is a bit more resilient. Both phones have the same display sizes and resolutions as their predecessors. You get a 5.8-inch display on the Galaxy S9, and a 6.2-inch display on the Galaxy S9+. Both are Super AMOLED panels with an 18.5:9 aspect ratio and a native resolution of 1440x2960 (Quad HD+). For some reason, Samsung continues to ship its flagships with the screen resolution set lower resolution by default, but this can be changed in the Settings app. We found the default colour saturation level too jarring, but dropping this down to the ‘Basic’ colour profile felt much better. Both displays also support HDR, which we’ll talk about later on.  The physical buttons have good feedback and are easy to reach on the Galaxy S9, but predictably, less so on the Galaxy S9+. We often fond ourselves shuffling the larger model around in our palm in order to get to the volume and power buttons on the side. The dedicated Bixby button is still present, and cannot be re-mapped to perform any other function. A single press takes you to Bixby’s home screen, which offers card-based information about places around you (powered by Foursquare), news (powered by Flipboard), and even updates from installed apps such as Twitter, Uber, etc. Holding down the Bixby button lets you use voice commands. For instance, you can ask it to send a message to someone through WhatsApp, followed by the actual message. In practice, we found that Bixby worked decently well, as long as we phrased our commands correctly. Samsung provides a list of suggested voice commands for some popular apps. Bixby has even more functions, which we’ll get into soon. We’re happy to see Samsung still hanging on to the 3.5mm headphones socket, and there's also a USB Type-C port and a speaker on the bottom of each phone. Both Galaxy S9 phones vibrate slightly for haptic feedback when you press their on-screen Home buttons. There’s a dual Nano-SIM tray on the top, with the provision for a microSD card for storage expansion (up to 400GB). The Galaxy S9 unit that we received for review wasn’t an Indian retail unit, which is why it only had a single SIM slot. Both phones also have RGB notification LEDs.  Samsung has changed the backs of these phones compared to the Galaxy S8 series, and it's for the better. The fingerprint sensors are now a lot more accessible and are actually useful, as compared to their awkward placement on the Galaxy S8 models. It’s also easy to distinguish them from the camera modules by touch, thanks to the prominent ridges around them. The heart rate sensors are still present, and take their place below the LED flashes on each phone. With the Galaxy S9+, you get a second camera with a telephoto lens, which sits just below the primary camera. The camera bumps on both phones are negligible in thickness, and the phones don't rock when placed on a flat surface. The Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ have very good build quality and look every bit as premium as you’d expect from a flagship smartphone in 2018. Samsung sent us the Lilac Purple and Midnight Black versions, and there’s also a Coral Blue option to choose from, though surprisingly the Titanium Grey version hasn't come to India (yet). In each phone's box, you get an AKG-tuned headset, a power adapter with fast charging support, a Type-C cable, a SIM eject tool, a silicone case, and a USB Type-C to Type-A adapter for migrating data from your old phone. Each new wave of flagships brings refreshed specifications, and for 2018, Samsung is using either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 mobile platform or its own Exynos 9810 SoC, in different countries. As always, India gets the Exynos variants of both phones. This chip features a cluster of four custom CPU cores and a lower clocked cluster of four Cortex-A55 cores. It features the new Mali-G72 GPU, which promises up to 20 percent better performance than that of its predecessor. Now, you’re probably thinking, is this better than the Qualcomm chip? It’s hard to say without actually testing both versions side-by-side, but on paper, they both promise similar features and capabiltiies. Both are built on Samsung’s second-gen 10nm FinFET process, both have eight cores, and both support 4K displays. You get Gigabit LTE modems and improved efficiency in augmented reality applications with either chip. .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#999;}.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#999}.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#999}.tg .tg-7hla{background-color:#e31b1a}.tg .tg-baqh{text-align:center;vertical-align:top}.tg .tg-jzba{font-weight:bold;background-color:#e31b1a;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;text-color:#ffffff}.tg .tg-9hbo{font-weight:bold;vertical-align:top}.tg .tg-jogk{font-style:italic;vertical-align:top} Samsung has also made a bold decision when it comes to the amount of RAM it has used for these two devices. The Galaxy S9 gets only 4GB of RAM while the Galaxy S9+ gets 6GB of RAM. Looking the benchmark scores, at least, there doesn’t seem to be much of a performance tradeoff. The performance of both phones are nearly on par. In fact, we got slightly higher scores in some tests on the Galaxy S9 than the S9+. The amount of onboard storage is the same for both models, starting at 64GB though you can choose 256GB variants of each, at higher prices.  Other specifications that are common to both phones include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac with MU-MIMO antennas, Bluetooth 5, NFC, USB-OTG, GPS, 4G VoLTE, and a suite of sensors which include a barometer, a Hall sensor, and a pressure sensor in addition to the usual suspects. Both phones are IP68 dust- and water-resistant, which allows them to survive being submerged in up to 1.5m of fresh water for up to 30 minutes. Both phones come with the Samsung Experience 9, which is based on Android Oreo 8.0. Both also show that they have received recent security patches. Our Galaxy S9 unit got the March 2018 security update during our review period, though it's yet to be rolled out to the Indian version of this phone. Our Galaxy S9+ was running the January update. This is not the latest version of Android (8.1), but it's still a good sign, because one thing that Samsung needs to improve on is the timeliness of its Android updates. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ only recently began receiving the Oreo update, only to be halted due to a software glitch, which was thankfully sorted out a week later. The Galaxy Note 8, which was Samsung’s top-tier offering till just now, is yet to receive Oreo, which is a huge surprise. In contrast, Sony began issuing Oreo updates for its premium offerings back in October last year, while HTC did the same for the U11 a month later. Thankfully, both new phones are said to have support for Project Treble (Google’s solution to break the update bottleneck created by OEMs). Android P is right around the corner and, Samsung simply does not have an excuse to lag behind Google’s update cycle anymore.  There’s a lot going on in terms of features, gestures and shortcuts, and most of them will be instantly familiar to anyone who’s used Samsung’s previous generation flagship smartphones. The number of customisation options can be overwhelming for first-time users but for those that love tweaking their phones and setting up shortcuts for every little thing, the Samsung Experience has you covered.  You can customise the phone with wallpapers, icons, and themes from a dedicated online store; create pop-up windows for certain apps which can be resized or minimised into floating balloons for easy access; use gestures to trigger one-handed mode or capture a screenshot; set up a custom message and contact for SOS mode; and use the fingerprint sensor to pull down the notifications shade. The Always On display also has a tonne of customisation options, such as different clock styles. Like with previous models, there are interactive widgets for music controls, today’s schedule, and the next alarm. For the new Galaxy S9 series, Samsung has added a security feature called Intelligent Scan, which essentially combines iris recognition and face scanning when you're unlocking either phone. However, this mode doesn’t quite live up to its name, and can be annoying. For starters, the phone won't unlock if you have sunglasses on, and unfortunately, there’s no raise-to-wake gesture which means you have to press either the power button or the virtual home button in order to wake the screen. There were moments during our review period when it worked quickly, but more often than not, we found it to be slow and very inconsistent. Even though Samsung says that both iris and face biometrics are used in this mode, it doesn’t need data from both scans to work. In some cases, the phone unlocked itself even when our eyes were closed, which suggests that it falls back to just face recognition when the user's irises aren't scanned. That leaves us with some doubts about its usefulness compared to just using face recognition on its own.  On the other hand, the iris scanner was usually quicker and worked even in complete darkness. If you’re in a moving vehicle or walking, however, it’s tricky to get this to work as your eyes need to be aligned with the sensor. Face unlocking is easier to use but is potentially less secure and doesn’t work in low light at all. In the end, we simply wound up using the fingerprint sensor more often than any of the other biometric modes, as it’s the most reliable, and the scanner is now easier to reach at the back. Samsung has its own cloud service and gives you 15GB of storage for backing up your photos and videos, Samsung Notes, contacts, calendar entries, reminders, and keyboard settings. Samsung Pass lets you use your biometrics to log in to websites, but this only works in Samsung’s own browser. Samsung Pay is supported and works well. The Device Maintenance app lets you check your battery usage and switch between Game, Entertainment and High Performance modes, each of which lets you customise the screen's brightness and resolution. Game Launcher gets a slick new interface and helps group all your installed games in one place. Within a game, you can use it to suppress alerts, prevent accidental touches to the edges of the display, take screenshots, and trigger screen captures. When you first set up the phone, Samsung lets you choose which of its own apps you'd like to install, and you can skip most of them if you’re happy using Google’s version of, say, the music player or Web browser. Microsoft’s apps are preinstalled anyway, and you can disable them if you want but you can't uninstall them. You can always get more Samsung apps from the Galaxy App store. Last but not least, Edge Panels let you quickly access your favourite contacts, apps, reminders, etc, and more panels can be downloaded too. You can pull them up with a quick swipe inward from the left edge of the screen, by default. We used both the Galaxy S9 and the Galaxy S9+ as our primary phone for a few days and it should come as no surprise that the smaller Galaxy S9 is definitely more comfortable to live with. It’s lighter, takes up less space in your pocket, and is much more convenient for one-handed use. Plus, you get the same high resolution display as with its bigger sibling so you’re not really missing out on much. The Galaxy S9+ obviously has a lot more free RAM at any given point, compared to the Galaxy S9, but having said that, we didn’t really notice much of a difference in real-world performance between the two.  They both handle multitasking and heavy games equally well. Perhaps as you accumulate more apps and data, the extra RAM in the Galaxy S9+ might give it an edge, but this is something we’ll only know with time. Games run just fine, and you’ll be happy to know that they don't heat the phone up too much. On the other hand, we did notice both phones running fairly warm at some points during our review period. We’re not sure if this is a trait of the new Exynos SoCs, but we found that the back, sides and the upper part of the display would get quite warm sometimes. This happened when using GPS in apps such as Uber or Google Maps, when downloading anything from the Play Store, and when we used the biometric authentication features multiple times in a row for testing.  The Samsung keyboard has gotten better but, in our opinion, it’s still no replacement for Gboard, which is also preinstalled on Indian units. Typing is slightly better on the Galaxy S9+ due to the bigger screen, and even though a bit of the display curves around the edges of the phone, we didn’t find this affecting typing too much. If you’re using two SIM cards, you can enable a feature called Smart Dual SIM, which lets you use both actively at the same time. This means that if you’re on a call, an incoming call on the other SIM card is automatically forwarded to the currently active SIM, after which you can merge both into a conference call or alternate between the two callers. We tested this and it worked pretty well. Call quality is very good and the earpiece gets quite loud, so conversing even in areas with lots of ambient noise isn’t an issue.  Samsung’s flagships have often been very good with media playback, and with the new Galaxy S9 series, things get a bit better because both phones have stereo speakers tuned by AKG. The main speaker is at the bottom and fires outwards, whereas the second one is actually the earpiece, which is also used when playing media files. It isn't as loud, and the bottom-firing speaker is clearly more powerful. However, it’s still better than having mono audio from just one side of the phone. There’s a Dolby Atmos toggle switch in the Settings app, which boosts the treble and mid range frequencies slightly so vocals sound crisper. Samsung claims a 3D surround sound experience with the Galaxy S9 duo, but in our testing, we didn’t find the surround effect to be very noticeable. The bundled headphones are also tuned by AKG, just like with the previous generation, and they offer a balanced sound with good passive noise cancellation. The display supports HDR, and compatible content looks good. HDR YouTube videos automatically boost the brightness level of the display all the way up. If you have HDR video clips, Samsung’s Video app handles them well. Besides Bixby’s voice commands, there's the visual search function called Bixby Vision. This works decently well for some tasks. You can access it through the Gallery app, and it can give you information about the photo you’re looking at. For instance, for a picture of a pizza, you can scroll over to the ‘Food’ button and Bixby will try and recognise the type of food, estimate the number of calories per serving, and let you look up similar recipes on Pinterest or videos on YouTube. You can also sent the nutrition information to the Samsung Heath app to help you track your diet. This obviously cannot detect the exact number of calories on your plate based on just an image, so take this information as a rough guideline. Image recognition works well, and we had a good success rate when we tested it. Bixby Vision can also recognise text in images, which can be exported to a text file or translated to another language using Google Translate.  You can use Bixby within the camera app as well, where it gives you real-time information about objects or scenes in the viewfinder. Real-time text translation works pretty well, and the app superimposes translated text over the actual text seen through the viewfinder. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to get the translation right. While this is a neat trick, the main feature of the primary camera on each phone is its new sensor and the physically variable aperture, which is a first for any smartphone. Samsung is going to town talking about this, so let's see if it lives up to the hype. The main camera on both phones has a 1/2.55-inch, 12-megapixel sensor with a pixel size of 1.4 microns, Dual Pixel autofocus system, and 77-degree field of view. You now have the ability to change the aperture from f/2.4 to f/1.5. This is not simulated in software, and you can actually see the aperture opening and closing. You can’t select values between f/1.5 and f/2.4 as we haven’t reached that level of engineering yet, but we have to say, it's pretty cool by itself. Tap to see full-sized Samsung Galaxy S9+ camera samples  So why would you need a variable aperture, and where would it be useful? The first and most obvious advantage of having a wider aperture (f/1.5) is to let more light hit the sensor, which lets you capture brighter images with less noise, since the shutter speed and ISO don't have to compensate as much. When we tested both phones, landscapes taken in low light had little to no noise, and in some shots, we were able to capture good detail in objects even at great distances. Dynamic range is also preserved well, and optical image stabilisation helps in getting blur-free shots. Shutter lag is minimal and the burst mode can help you getting a usable photos even when shooting from a moving vehicle in low light. The second advantage of having a variable aperture is that you can control the depth of field or background blur in close-up shots. This is particularly useful during the day. In Auto mode, the sensor mostly picks the narrower (f/2.4) aperture when shooting outdoors during the day, as the sensor gets adequate light. The main sensors in both phones can work wonders under good lighting. The colour tone is a bit on the warm side, which has typically been the case with all of Samsung’s flagships in the recent past. Saturation levels can also be a bit aggressive at times, especially when shooting flowers or anything with bright colours. Landscapes exhibit good detail, and the Auto HDR does a good job in getting the exposure right, even under harsh sunlight. In Pro mode, you can manually switch between the two apertures and also tweak settings such as the shutter speed (10-1/24,000), light metering, autofocus area, white balance, colour tone, and exposure. You can enable RAW mode, which saves JPEG and RAW files. While it's great that we have the option to switch apertures, we often found ourselves leaving that up to the camera software to decide. You can play with it if you want more artistic freedom, but we think that most users will be happy with the results that the phone delivers. Tap to see full-sized Samsung Galaxy S9 camera samples 240fps slow-motion video can now recorded at 1080p rather than 720p, which is a welcome bump in quality. However, the main attraction is a brand new super slow-mo mode which can shoot short bursts of video at 960fps. This is similar to what Sony did last year with the Xperia XZ Premium (Review), which used a stacked image sensor to capture 0.2 seconds of footage and stretched that to six seconds, thus giving you a super-slow-motion effect. The resolution for 960fps videos is only 720p, and you can choose to have either a single slow motion shot, or take multiple bursts (up to 20 in a single file) when recording. Now being able to get the perfect 0.2 seconds of footage is no easy feat, which is why Samsung has thoughtfully implemented an Auto mode. Here, you get a little square marker on the screen, which you can resize and move about within the frame to where the action will take place. After hitting record, any motion that’s detected within the marker automatically triggers the burst. It takes a few seconds for the camera app to process and save this data before it's ready to shoot again. The motion detection works well and is definitely a lot better than struggling to achieve that level of precision. The camera app is a lot easier to use than before. You can now rearrange the order of mode icons and switch between them simply by swiping across the viewfinder. We found that you can’t use voice commands to take a picture if you’ve trained Bixby to wake up using your voice. The shortcut to launch the camera by double-pressing the power button has been removed from the Indian firmware (our S9+ unit), most likely because of the SOS function that is now compulsory here, but this shortcut is present in the European firmware that we were able to evaluate. One big feature that Samsung has introduced with the Galaxy S9 series is AR Emojis. If you’re thinking this sounds awfully similar to Apple’s Animojis, then you’re spot on. Available for both the rear and front cameras, AR Emojis are animated avatars that are created and personalised using photos of your face. These can be sent to people as video files. You can also create a sticker pack (animated GIFs) out of your avatar, which can be accessed directly from within the Samsung Keyboard in messaging apps.  There’s no easy way to put this, but after using the AR Emoji feature for about a week, it felt like a half-baked attempt at aping Apple’s Animojis. First off, it uses the regular front camera instead of something more advanced like Apple's dot projector, so it cannot map the contours of your face in detail. Due to this, the animated avatars aren't able to replicate subtle expressions, and even when you keep a straight face, the mouths and eyes of the avatars tend to twitch and wiggle. At launch time, you can swap out your face for a bunny, a bright pink cat, or a weird blue animal. We also found that the phones get warm quickly when using AR Emojis. Coming to the telephoto lens on the Galaxy S9+, this is the same unit that is used on the Galaxy Note 8. It’s a 12-megapixel sensor with an f/2.4 aperture, and there's a 6mm focal length (versus 4.3mm on the main sensor). The field of view is narrower but you get 2x optical zoom, which is good. You can switch to the second sensor in some shooting modes for both stills and video, and you can also use it for taking portraits. Live Focus uses the main sensor to calculate depth, while capturing images with the second one. You can vary the depth of field before and after you’ve taken a shot, and also save the wide and zoomed frames, just like on the Note 8. The effect is good and the software does a good job with edge detection too. If light isn’t adequate enough to get a decent shot with the secondary camera, live focus refuses to work. Also, hitting the 2x button in very low light simply triggers a digital zoom through the main camera's lens instead of switching to the second camera's telephoto lens. The Galaxy S9 might lack a second camera but it can perform similar depth of field effects with its Selective Focus shooting mode. Unlike the Galaxy S9+, you can’t adjust the level of blur, but you can select whether you want the foreground or background in focus after taking shots. Edge detection isn't handled very well most of the time, as compared to the Galaxy S9+ (which you can see from the sample above). The front cameras on both phones are once again 8-megapixel sensors with f/1.7 apertures, just like their predecessors. Image quality is good under good lighting although we found that photos lacked the level of detail that the Google Pixel 2 achieves. In low light, the screen flash is quite effective, but resulting images are often soft. There's a beauty mode which applies different styles of makeup to your face, and we found that it often did not end well. Galaxy S9+ Live Focus (above) versus Selective Focus on Galaxy S9 (below) The Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ have the same battery capacities as their respective predecessors, and also support both wired and wireless fast charging. With the display resolutions set to Quad HD+ on both phones, we managed to just about squeeze in an entire day’s worth of usage with the Galaxy S9 but went comfortably beyond that with the Galaxy S9+. With heavier use, we found that even the Galaxy S9+ struggled to breach the 24-hour mark. In our HD video loop test, the Galaxy S9+ with its 3500mAh battery lasted two hours longer than the Galaxy S9 and its smaller 3000mAh battery. Running the phones at a lower resolution could give you a bit more mileage. Using the bundled adapters, we were able to charge both phones pretty quickly. We got up to roughly 75 percent from zero within an hour using the Galaxy S9+, and our experience with the Galaxy S9 was similar. VerdictSamsung hasn’t made any drastic changes to the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ compared to their predecessors, and the company didn’t really need to do much. Last year's design is still stunning, and now, it’s a little more polished. We’ve seen Apple do that with its iPhones for a couple of years at a stretch, so this is nothing new. If you really want to stand out, get either phone in the new Lilac Purple colour option. Both new phones are solid, dependable workhorses with excellent displays, premium craftsmanship, and improved cameras. We didn’t notice any immediate benefit to the extra RAM that the Galaxy S9+ has over the Galaxy S9, and it didn't reflect in benchmarks either. Whether that will hold up after a few months of usage is something we’ll know in time. Current owners of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ needn’t rush out to upgrade to the new models, as we don’t think there’s a whole lot to be gained. Sure, they are better in some respects, but not enough to warrant the cost of the upgrade. On the other hand, if you have a phone that's several years old and have been waiting for a new crop of Android flagships, the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ are definitely worth considering. Just like the Galaxy S8 models, we have no doubt that these will be very popular. The fact that they have been launched at the same prices as last year’s models in India will definitely earn Samsung some brownie points. The Galaxy S9 starts at Rs. 57,900, while the Galaxy S9+ is priced at Rs. 64,900. With other smartphone manufactures asking absurd premiums for a smartphone (yes, we’re looking at you Apple), it’s refreshing to see Samsung holding steady. The fact that all Samsung phones are now made in India could contribute to keeping the prices constant. We’re only just getting started with 2018's flagships, and there are plenty more to come from other manufacturers. By launching its phones so quickly in India, Samsung has put itself ahead in the race. Right now, these are among the best Android smartphones you can get for your money.

If you're wondering whether you should bother upgrading, read on.    We begin with the design, which has gotten some minor improvements, but is still very similar to last year’s models for the most part. This is not a bad thing, considering that we loved the design of the Galaxy S8 series. You get the same premium blend of glass and metal. The Galaxy S9 is definitely easier to handle and live with due to its smaller footprint and lower weight, but both phones have the same thickness of 8.5mm. The exposed aluminium sides offer enough surface area to grip the Galaxy S9 when lifting it or when you’re on a call, but its front and back can be slippery. The Galaxy S9+ is definitely a handful in the literal sense, and is a little tough to manage with just one hand. Also, due to the near bezel-less design, we often had many accidental screen touches with the bigger model. The glass back lets you charge the phone wirelessly and also perform contactless payments through Samsung Pay. However, it’s a major fingerprint magnet. It doesn’t take much to get a lot of smudges on the back. The display is a bit more resilient. Both phones have the same display sizes and resolutions as their predecessors. You get a 5.8-inch display on the Galaxy S9, and a 6.2-inch display on the Galaxy S9+. Both are Super AMOLED panels with an 18.5:9 aspect ratio and a native resolution of 1440x2960 (Quad HD+). For some reason, Samsung continues to ship its flagships with the screen resolution set lower resolution by default, but this can be changed in the Settings app. We found the default colour saturation level too jarring, but dropping this down to the ‘Basic’ colour profile felt much better. Both displays also support HDR, which we’ll talk about later on.  The physical buttons have good feedback and are easy to reach on the Galaxy S9, but predictably, less so on the Galaxy S9+. We often fond ourselves shuffling the larger model around in our palm in order to get to the volume and power buttons on the side. The dedicated Bixby button is still present, and cannot be re-mapped to perform any other function. A single press takes you to Bixby’s home screen, which offers card-based information about places around you (powered by Foursquare), news (powered by Flipboard), and even updates from installed apps such as Twitter, Uber, etc. Holding down the Bixby button lets you use voice commands. For instance, you can ask it to send a message to someone through WhatsApp, followed by the actual message. In practice, we found that Bixby worked decently well, as long as we phrased our commands correctly. Samsung provides a list of suggested voice commands for some popular apps. Bixby has even more functions, which we’ll get into soon. We’re happy to see Samsung still hanging on to the 3.5mm headphones socket, and there's also a USB Type-C port and a speaker on the bottom of each phone. Both Galaxy S9 phones vibrate slightly for haptic feedback when you press their on-screen Home buttons. There’s a dual Nano-SIM tray on the top, with the provision for a microSD card for storage expansion (up to 400GB). The Galaxy S9 unit that we received for review wasn’t an Indian retail unit, which is why it only had a single SIM slot. Both phones also have RGB notification LEDs.  Samsung has changed the backs of these phones compared to the Galaxy S8 series, and it's for the better. The fingerprint sensors are now a lot more accessible and are actually useful, as compared to their awkward placement on the Galaxy S8 models. It’s also easy to distinguish them from the camera modules by touch, thanks to the prominent ridges around them. The heart rate sensors are still present, and take their place below the LED flashes on each phone. With the Galaxy S9+, you get a second camera with a telephoto lens, which sits just below the primary camera. The camera bumps on both phones are negligible in thickness, and the phones don't rock when placed on a flat surface. The Samsung Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ have very good build quality and look every bit as premium as you’d expect from a flagship smartphone in 2018. Samsung sent us the Lilac Purple and Midnight Black versions, and there’s also a Coral Blue option to choose from, though surprisingly the Titanium Grey version hasn't come to India (yet). In each phone's box, you get an AKG-tuned headset, a power adapter with fast charging support, a Type-C cable, a SIM eject tool, a silicone case, and a USB Type-C to Type-A adapter for migrating data from your old phone. Each new wave of flagships brings refreshed specifications, and for 2018, Samsung is using either the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 mobile platform or its own Exynos 9810 SoC, in different countries. As always, India gets the Exynos variants of both phones. This chip features a cluster of four custom CPU cores and a lower clocked cluster of four Cortex-A55 cores. It features the new Mali-G72 GPU, which promises up to 20 percent better performance than that of its predecessor. Now, you’re probably thinking, is this better than the Qualcomm chip? It’s hard to say without actually testing both versions side-by-side, but on paper, they both promise similar features and capabiltiies. Both are built on Samsung’s second-gen 10nm FinFET process, both have eight cores, and both support 4K displays. You get Gigabit LTE modems and improved efficiency in augmented reality applications with either chip. .tg  {border-collapse:collapse;border-spacing:0;border-color:#999;}.tg td{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#999}.tg th{font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-weight:normal;padding:10px 5px;border-style:solid;border-width:1px;overflow:hidden;word-break:normal;border-color:#999}.tg .tg-7hla{background-color:#e31b1a}.tg .tg-baqh{text-align:center;vertical-align:top}.tg .tg-jzba{font-weight:bold;background-color:#e31b1a;text-align:center;vertical-align:top;text-color:#ffffff}.tg .tg-9hbo{font-weight:bold;vertical-align:top}.tg .tg-jogk{font-style:italic;vertical-align:top} Samsung has also made a bold decision when it comes to the amount of RAM it has used for these two devices. The Galaxy S9 gets only 4GB of RAM while the Galaxy S9+ gets 6GB of RAM. Looking the benchmark scores, at least, there doesn’t seem to be much of a performance tradeoff. The performance of both phones are nearly on par. In fact, we got slightly higher scores in some tests on the Galaxy S9 than the S9+. The amount of onboard storage is the same for both models, starting at 64GB though you can choose 256GB variants of each, at higher prices.  Other specifications that are common to both phones include dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac with MU-MIMO antennas, Bluetooth 5, NFC, USB-OTG, GPS, 4G VoLTE, and a suite of sensors which include a barometer, a Hall sensor, and a pressure sensor in addition to the usual suspects. Both phones are IP68 dust- and water-resistant, which allows them to survive being submerged in up to 1.5m of fresh water for up to 30 minutes. Both phones come with the Samsung Experience 9, which is based on Android Oreo 8.0. Both also show that they have received recent security patches. Our Galaxy S9 unit got the March 2018 security update during our review period, though it's yet to be rolled out to the Indian version of this phone. Our Galaxy S9+ was running the January update. This is not the latest version of Android (8.1), but it's still a good sign, because one thing that Samsung needs to improve on is the timeliness of its Android updates. The Galaxy S8 and S8+ only recently began receiving the Oreo update, only to be halted due to a software glitch, which was thankfully sorted out a week later. The Galaxy Note 8, which was Samsung’s top-tier offering till just now, is yet to receive Oreo, which is a huge surprise. In contrast, Sony began issuing Oreo updates for its premium offerings back in October last year, while HTC did the same for the U11 a month later. Thankfully, both new phones are said to have support for Project Treble (Google’s solution to break the update bottleneck created by OEMs). Android P is right around the corner and, Samsung simply does not have an excuse to lag behind Google’s update cycle anymore.  There’s a lot going on in terms of features, gestures and shortcuts, and most of them will be instantly familiar to anyone who’s used Samsung’s previous generation flagship smartphones. The number of customisation options can be overwhelming for first-time users but for those that love tweaking their phones and setting up shortcuts for every little thing, the Samsung Experience has you covered.  You can customise the phone with wallpapers, icons, and themes from a dedicated online store; create pop-up windows for certain apps which can be resized or minimised into floating balloons for easy access; use gestures to trigger one-handed mode or capture a screenshot; set up a custom message and contact for SOS mode; and use the fingerprint sensor to pull down the notifications shade. The Always On display also has a tonne of customisation options, such as different clock styles. Like with previous models, there are interactive widgets for music controls, today’s schedule, and the next alarm. For the new Galaxy S9 series, Samsung has added a security feature called Intelligent Scan, which essentially combines iris recognition and face scanning when you're unlocking either phone. However, this mode doesn’t quite live up to its name, and can be annoying. For starters, the phone won't unlock if you have sunglasses on, and unfortunately, there’s no raise-to-wake gesture which means you have to press either the power button or the virtual home button in order to wake the screen. There were moments during our review period when it worked quickly, but more often than not, we found it to be slow and very inconsistent. Even though Samsung says that both iris and face biometrics are used in this mode, it doesn’t need data from both scans to work. In some cases, the phone unlocked itself even when our eyes were closed, which suggests that it falls back to just face recognition when the user's irises aren't scanned. That leaves us with some doubts about its usefulness compared to just using face recognition on its own.  On the other hand, the iris scanner was usually quicker and worked even in complete darkness. If you’re in a moving vehicle or walking, however, it’s tricky to get this to work as your eyes need to be aligned with the sensor. Face unlocking is easier to use but is potentially less secure and doesn’t work in low light at all. In the end, we simply wound up using the fingerprint sensor more often than any of the other biometric modes, as it’s the most reliable, and the scanner is now easier to reach at the back. Samsung has its own cloud service and gives you 15GB of storage for backing up your photos and videos, Samsung Notes, contacts, calendar entries, reminders, and keyboard settings. Samsung Pass lets you use your biometrics to log in to websites, but this only works in Samsung’s own browser. Samsung Pay is supported and works well. The Device Maintenance app lets you check your battery usage and switch between Game, Entertainment and High Performance modes, each of which lets you customise the screen's brightness and resolution. Game Launcher gets a slick new interface and helps group all your installed games in one place. Within a game, you can use it to suppress alerts, prevent accidental touches to the edges of the display, take screenshots, and trigger screen captures. When you first set up the phone, Samsung lets you choose which of its own apps you'd like to install, and you can skip most of them if you’re happy using Google’s version of, say, the music player or Web browser. Microsoft’s apps are preinstalled anyway, and you can disable them if you want but you can't uninstall them. You can always get more Samsung apps from the Galaxy App store. Last but not least, Edge Panels let you quickly access your favourite contacts, apps, reminders, etc, and more panels can be downloaded too. You can pull them up with a quick swipe inward from the left edge of the screen, by default. We used both the Galaxy S9 and the Galaxy S9+ as our primary phone for a few days and it should come as no surprise that the smaller Galaxy S9 is definitely more comfortable to live with. It’s lighter, takes up less space in your pocket, and is much more convenient for one-handed use. Plus, you get the same high resolution display as with its bigger sibling so you’re not really missing out on much. The Galaxy S9+ obviously has a lot more free RAM at any given point, compared to the Galaxy S9, but having said that, we didn’t really notice much of a difference in real-world performance between the two.  They both handle multitasking and heavy games equally well. Perhaps as you accumulate more apps and data, the extra RAM in the Galaxy S9+ might give it an edge, but this is something we’ll only know with time. Games run just fine, and you’ll be happy to know that they don't heat the phone up too much. On the other hand, we did notice both phones running fairly warm at some points during our review period. We’re not sure if this is a trait of the new Exynos SoCs, but we found that the back, sides and the upper part of the display would get quite warm sometimes. This happened when using GPS in apps such as Uber or Google Maps, when downloading anything from the Play Store, and when we used the biometric authentication features multiple times in a row for testing.  The Samsung keyboard has gotten better but, in our opinion, it’s still no replacement for Gboard, which is also preinstalled on Indian units. Typing is slightly better on the Galaxy S9+ due to the bigger screen, and even though a bit of the display curves around the edges of the phone, we didn’t find this affecting typing too much. If you’re using two SIM cards, you can enable a feature called Smart Dual SIM, which lets you use both actively at the same time. This means that if you’re on a call, an incoming call on the other SIM card is automatically forwarded to the currently active SIM, after which you can merge both into a conference call or alternate between the two callers. We tested this and it worked pretty well. Call quality is very good and the earpiece gets quite loud, so conversing even in areas with lots of ambient noise isn’t an issue.  Samsung’s flagships have often been very good with media playback, and with the new Galaxy S9 series, things get a bit better because both phones have stereo speakers tuned by AKG. The main speaker is at the bottom and fires outwards, whereas the second one is actually the earpiece, which is also used when playing media files. It isn't as loud, and the bottom-firing speaker is clearly more powerful. However, it’s still better than having mono audio from just one side of the phone. There’s a Dolby Atmos toggle switch in the Settings app, which boosts the treble and mid range frequencies slightly so vocals sound crisper. Samsung claims a 3D surround sound experience with the Galaxy S9 duo, but in our testing, we didn’t find the surround effect to be very noticeable. The bundled headphones are also tuned by AKG, just like with the previous generation, and they offer a balanced sound with good passive noise cancellation. The display supports HDR, and compatible content looks good. HDR YouTube videos automatically boost the brightness level of the display all the way up. If you have HDR video clips, Samsung’s Video app handles them well. Besides Bixby’s voice commands, there's the visual search function called Bixby Vision. This works decently well for some tasks. You can access it through the Gallery app, and it can give you information about the photo you’re looking at. For instance, for a picture of a pizza, you can scroll over to the ‘Food’ button and Bixby will try and recognise the type of food, estimate the number of calories per serving, and let you look up similar recipes on Pinterest or videos on YouTube. You can also sent the nutrition information to the Samsung Heath app to help you track your diet. This obviously cannot detect the exact number of calories on your plate based on just an image, so take this information as a rough guideline. Image recognition works well, and we had a good success rate when we tested it. Bixby Vision can also recognise text in images, which can be exported to a text file or translated to another language using Google Translate.  You can use Bixby within the camera app as well, where it gives you real-time information about objects or scenes in the viewfinder. Real-time text translation works pretty well, and the app superimposes translated text over the actual text seen through the viewfinder. Sometimes, it takes a few tries to get the translation right. While this is a neat trick, the main feature of the primary camera on each phone is its new sensor and the physically variable aperture, which is a first for any smartphone. Samsung is going to town talking about this, so let's see if it lives up to the hype. The main camera on both phones has a 1/2.55-inch, 12-megapixel sensor with a pixel size of 1.4 microns, Dual Pixel autofocus system, and 77-degree field of view. You now have the ability to change the aperture from f/2.4 to f/1.5. This is not simulated in software, and you can actually see the aperture opening and closing. You can’t select values between f/1.5 and f/2.4 as we haven’t reached that level of engineering yet, but we have to say, it's pretty cool by itself. Tap to see full-sized Samsung Galaxy S9+ camera samples  So why would you need a variable aperture, and where would it be useful? The first and most obvious advantage of having a wider aperture (f/1.5) is to let more light hit the sensor, which lets you capture brighter images with less noise, since the shutter speed and ISO don't have to compensate as much. When we tested both phones, landscapes taken in low light had little to no noise, and in some shots, we were able to capture good detail in objects even at great distances. Dynamic range is also preserved well, and optical image stabilisation helps in getting blur-free shots. Shutter lag is minimal and the burst mode can help you getting a usable photos even when shooting from a moving vehicle in low light. The second advantage of having a variable aperture is that you can control the depth of field or background blur in close-up shots. This is particularly useful during the day. In Auto mode, the sensor mostly picks the narrower (f/2.4) aperture when shooting outdoors during the day, as the sensor gets adequate light. The main sensors in both phones can work wonders under good lighting. The colour tone is a bit on the warm side, which has typically been the case with all of Samsung’s flagships in the recent past. Saturation levels can also be a bit aggressive at times, especially when shooting flowers or anything with bright colours. Landscapes exhibit good detail, and the Auto HDR does a good job in getting the exposure right, even under harsh sunlight. In Pro mode, you can manually switch between the two apertures and also tweak settings such as the shutter speed (10-1/24,000), light metering, autofocus area, white balance, colour tone, and exposure. You can enable RAW mode, which saves JPEG and RAW files. While it's great that we have the option to switch apertures, we often found ourselves leaving that up to the camera software to decide. You can play with it if you want more artistic freedom, but we think that most users will be happy with the results that the phone delivers. Tap to see full-sized Samsung Galaxy S9 camera samples 240fps slow-motion video can now recorded at 1080p rather than 720p, which is a welcome bump in quality. However, the main attraction is a brand new super slow-mo mode which can shoot short bursts of video at 960fps. This is similar to what Sony did last year with the Xperia XZ Premium (Review), which used a stacked image sensor to capture 0.2 seconds of footage and stretched that to six seconds, thus giving you a super-slow-motion effect. The resolution for 960fps videos is only 720p, and you can choose to have either a single slow motion shot, or take multiple bursts (up to 20 in a single file) when recording. Now being able to get the perfect 0.2 seconds of footage is no easy feat, which is why Samsung has thoughtfully implemented an Auto mode. Here, you get a little square marker on the screen, which you can resize and move about within the frame to where the action will take place. After hitting record, any motion that’s detected within the marker automatically triggers the burst. It takes a few seconds for the camera app to process and save this data before it's ready to shoot again. The motion detection works well and is definitely a lot better than struggling to achieve that level of precision. The camera app is a lot easier to use than before. You can now rearrange the order of mode icons and switch between them simply by swiping across the viewfinder. We found that you can’t use voice commands to take a picture if you’ve trained Bixby to wake up using your voice. The shortcut to launch the camera by double-pressing the power button has been removed from the Indian firmware (our S9+ unit), most likely because of the SOS function that is now compulsory here, but this shortcut is present in the European firmware that we were able to evaluate. One big feature that Samsung has introduced with the Galaxy S9 series is AR Emojis. If you’re thinking this sounds awfully similar to Apple’s Animojis, then you’re spot on. Available for both the rear and front cameras, AR Emojis are animated avatars that are created and personalised using photos of your face. These can be sent to people as video files. You can also create a sticker pack (animated GIFs) out of your avatar, which can be accessed directly from within the Samsung Keyboard in messaging apps.  There’s no easy way to put this, but after using the AR Emoji feature for about a week, it felt like a half-baked attempt at aping Apple’s Animojis. First off, it uses the regular front camera instead of something more advanced like Apple's dot projector, so it cannot map the contours of your face in detail. Due to this, the animated avatars aren't able to replicate subtle expressions, and even when you keep a straight face, the mouths and eyes of the avatars tend to twitch and wiggle. At launch time, you can swap out your face for a bunny, a bright pink cat, or a weird blue animal. We also found that the phones get warm quickly when using AR Emojis. Coming to the telephoto lens on the Galaxy S9+, this is the same unit that is used on the Galaxy Note 8. It’s a 12-megapixel sensor with an f/2.4 aperture, and there's a 6mm focal length (versus 4.3mm on the main sensor). The field of view is narrower but you get 2x optical zoom, which is good. You can switch to the second sensor in some shooting modes for both stills and video, and you can also use it for taking portraits. Live Focus uses the main sensor to calculate depth, while capturing images with the second one. You can vary the depth of field before and after you’ve taken a shot, and also save the wide and zoomed frames, just like on the Note 8. The effect is good and the software does a good job with edge detection too. If light isn’t adequate enough to get a decent shot with the secondary camera, live focus refuses to work. Also, hitting the 2x button in very low light simply triggers a digital zoom through the main camera's lens instead of switching to the second camera's telephoto lens. The Galaxy S9 might lack a second camera but it can perform similar depth of field effects with its Selective Focus shooting mode. Unlike the Galaxy S9+, you can’t adjust the level of blur, but you can select whether you want the foreground or background in focus after taking shots. Edge detection isn't handled very well most of the time, as compared to the Galaxy S9+ (which you can see from the sample above). The front cameras on both phones are once again 8-megapixel sensors with f/1.7 apertures, just like their predecessors. Image quality is good under good lighting although we found that photos lacked the level of detail that the Google Pixel 2 achieves. In low light, the screen flash is quite effective, but resulting images are often soft. There's a beauty mode which applies different styles of makeup to your face, and we found that it often did not end well. Galaxy S9+ Live Focus (above) versus Selective Focus on Galaxy S9 (below) The Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ have the same battery capacities as their respective predecessors, and also support both wired and wireless fast charging. With the display resolutions set to Quad HD+ on both phones, we managed to just about squeeze in an entire day’s worth of usage with the Galaxy S9 but went comfortably beyond that with the Galaxy S9+. With heavier use, we found that even the Galaxy S9+ struggled to breach the 24-hour mark. In our HD video loop test, the Galaxy S9+ with its 3500mAh battery lasted two hours longer than the Galaxy S9 and its smaller 3000mAh battery. Running the phones at a lower resolution could give you a bit more mileage. Using the bundled adapters, we were able to charge both phones pretty quickly. We got up to roughly 75 percent from zero within an hour using the Galaxy S9+, and our experience with the Galaxy S9 was similar. VerdictSamsung hasn’t made any drastic changes to the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ compared to their predecessors, and the company didn’t really need to do much. Last year's design is still stunning, and now, it’s a little more polished. We’ve seen Apple do that with its iPhones for a couple of years at a stretch, so this is nothing new. If you really want to stand out, get either phone in the new Lilac Purple colour option. Both new phones are solid, dependable workhorses with excellent displays, premium craftsmanship, and improved cameras. We didn’t notice any immediate benefit to the extra RAM that the Galaxy S9+ has over the Galaxy S9, and it didn't reflect in benchmarks either. Whether that will hold up after a few months of usage is something we’ll know in time. Current owners of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ needn’t rush out to upgrade to the new models, as we don’t think there’s a whole lot to be gained. Sure, they are better in some respects, but not enough to warrant the cost of the upgrade. On the other hand, if you have a phone that's several years old and have been waiting for a new crop of Android flagships, the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ are definitely worth considering. Just like the Galaxy S8 models, we have no doubt that these will be very popular. The fact that they have been launched at the same prices as last year’s models in India will definitely earn Samsung some brownie points. The Galaxy S9 starts at Rs. 57,900, while the Galaxy S9+ is priced at Rs. 64,900. With other smartphone manufactures asking absurd premiums for a smartphone (yes, we’re looking at you Apple), it’s refreshing to see Samsung holding steady. The fact that all Samsung phones are now made in India could contribute to keeping the prices constant. We’re only just getting started with 2018's flagships, and there are plenty more to come from other manufacturers. By launching its phones so quickly in India, Samsung has put itself ahead in the race. Right now, these are among the best Android smartphones you can get for your money.

2449,21,samsung-m10-review-galaxy-m10-india-price-1985414,6,10,2019-01-31,1985414,Ali Pardiwala,Samsung Galaxy M10 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/samsung-m10-review-galaxy-m10-india-price-1985414," Despite the onslaught of affordable smartphones made by brands from China and beyond, India continues to have a love affair with Samsung. The Korean manufacturer has been selling its phones in the country for a long time, manufactures many of its devices in India itself, and has a fair amount of goodwill thanks to its excellent dealer and service networks. Therefore, any affordable option from Samsung needs to be taken seriously. Enter the Samsung Galaxy M10, a smartphone that is incredibly fresh and different from what we've come to expect from Samsung. The company previously shunned the idea of the notch, but the Samsung Galaxy M10 and slightly more expensive Galaxy M20 are the company's first phones to sport this element. While the notch itself might be considered a disruptive design element, the idea of the notch is to allow a screen that occupies more of the front, and that's the look Samsung is going for here. We've put the new Samsung Galaxy M10 through its paces, and here's our review.    The highlight of the Samsung Galaxy M10 is its screen, with its waterdrop-style notch at the top for the front camera. Just above the camera on the top edge sits the earpiece, and the entire thing looks similar to what we've seen on smartphones such as the OnePlus 6T and Oppo F9 Pro. A thin black border can be seen all around the screen, with it stretching almost till the top edge and leaving a narrow chin area at the bottom.  The back and sides of the Samsung Galaxy M10 are plastic, with curved edges and corners. The ports and buttons are all where we expected them to be, and the only thing that really stood out was the speaker grille at the back rather than at the bottom. This was common a few years ago, but now comes across as odd. It also causes audio to be slightly muffled when the phone is lying flat on its back, which can affect how loud the ringtone is. The top-left corner of the back of the phone has the dual-camera setup and flash, and you'll also see a Samsung logo and some regulatory text. The blue colour of our review unit looked good, but the plastic was prone to picking up fingerprints and smudges. Something that a lot of users will appreciate on the device is the SIM and external storage tray, which features dedicated slots for two Nano-SIM cards and a microSD card. It's also worth pointing out that the Samsung Galaxy M10 doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, and you only have face recognition as a method of biometric security on the device.    The screen on the phone is a 6.22-inch HD+ resolution ‘Infinity-V' TFT display, named so because of the shape of the notch. Perhaps its biggest issue is the resolution; at 720x1520 pixels, you get a 19:9 aspect ratio but it isn't very sharp. For basic usage, we didn't have too many issues, particularly with apps such as WhatsApp or anything that doesn't rely on heavy visuals. The Samsung Experience UI looks alright even with the lower resolution, although we could see some grain around the app icons. However, we weren't impressed with the screen when using it with Netflix and simple games such as Subway Surfers. We also didn't quite like the colours and brightness, and found that things don't look very good at wider viewing angles. Furthermore, the screen appears dull unless you drag the brightness slider all the way to the maximum level. What we did like about the screen was its size, proportions, and edge-to-edge design. When it comes to specifications, the Samsung Galaxy M10 comes across as a bit disappointing. Under the hood is the Exynos 7870 1.6GHz octa-core SoC, a processor that was first seen on the Samsung Galaxy J7 (2016), which was released roughly two and a half years ago. Fabricated on the 14nm process, this SoC was decent at the time of its launch but hasn't aged as well as competing SoCs from Qualcomm such as the Snapdragon 625. You get either 2GB or 3GB of RAM and either 16GB or 32GB of internal storage, as well as dual-VoLTE connectivity. Our review unit was the higher variant with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, priced at Rs. 8,990, with the other variant Rs. 1,000 cheaper.    You also get a 3,400mAh battery and a 5W charger in the box. While the battery capacity is acceptable given the price and specifications of the phone, the charger isn't nearly as fast as it should be. During our testing it took a little over three hours to fully charge the device. The phone also uses the dated Micro-USB standard for charging and data transfers. A 3.5mm headphone socket lets you connect wired headphones to the phone. The Samsung Galaxy M10 runs on Android 8.1 Oreo, with the Samsung Experience 9.5 UI on top. For anyone familiar with the software on Samsung's phones, the Galaxy M10's UI is just what you'd expect. While Samsung's smartphone software has improved of late, there is still a fair amount of bloat to contend with. Preinstalled on the phone are a handful of Samsung's system apps, some Microsoft apps, and Daily Hunt. Not all of these can be uninstalled, which can be bothersome in the long run, especially on the lower variant with 16GB of internal storage. A couple of interesting aspects include the lock screen Stories feature and the dual-messenger feature. The former shows you different images on the lock screen which often have to do with current events and news (but also a few ads), while the latter lets you have two instances of popular apps such as WhatsApp so you can use two different accounts on the same device. The Samsung Galaxy M10 features face recognition, but we found ourselves better off using a PIN or no security at all. The face recognition feature took a few seconds to unlock the phone each time we tried it, and often failed even in good lighting conditions. With a dated processor, the Samsung Galaxy M10 is disappointing when it comes to performance. Apart from the slow face recognition, there are considerable delays in various other simple functions, such as switching from the camera to the gallery to view pictures we had just shot, reloading some background apps, and quick multi-tasking when we needed to switch between apps. We often even noticed a slight delay in responsiveness to taps within the UI itself, such as in the Settings app. 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage is now what we'd expect from a sub-Rs. 10,000 smartphone, and Samsung has delivered this on the variant priced at Rs. 8,990. You can run most popular apps, including instant messaging, social media services, and basic games without much trouble once they've loaded up. We did try to run PUBG Mobile on the phone, and the experience was expectedly poor with plenty of performance issues even at the lowest graphics settings. Putting the Samsung Galaxy M10 through our usual suite of benchmarking tools, we got results that were in line with the dated SoC. AnTuTu produced a score of 64,371, while Geekbench returned a single-core score of 728 and a multi-core score of 3,674. These numbers might have been good enough for a mid-range smartphone back in 2016, but serve as adequate evidence of the Galaxy M10's poor performance in 2019. Even the graphical benchmark tests returned scores that were lower than those of the similarly priced Realme C1 (Review). We put the Samsung Galaxy M10 through our HD video loop battery test and got a screen time of 14 hours and 29 minutes with a full charge of the 3,400mAh battery. The HD+ resolution of the screen and power-efficient processor can be credited with the good battery life, and we saw a similar level of efficiency even in day-to-day usage.  With basic usage that included having a single SIM card connected to an LTE network, taking a few photos, streaming some Netflix video, and playing a few basic games, the phone easily lasted through the day with plenty of power left to carry through till around noon of the next day. As mentioned, the only drawback in this aspect is the slow charging.    The Samsung Galaxy M10 features a dual-camera setup at the rear, comprised of a 13-megapixel main sensor with an f/1.9 aperture and a 5-megapixel secondary sensor with an f/2.2 aperture. The second camera enables ultra-wide angle photography, and can be selected through the camera app on the smartphone. You also get a 5-megapixel f/2.0 front camera, with both the front and rear cameras capable of recording full-HD video. The primary rear camera on the Samsung Galaxy M10 isn't bad by any means considering the price of the device, but it isn't very good either. Photos taken with the Samsung Galaxy M10 are good at first glance, but looking closely shows some grain and lack of detail. Furthermore, colours are a bit dull, and the photos appear a bit darker than the actual scenes photographed.  Tap to see full-sized Samsung Galaxy M10 camera samples   The wide-angle camera lets you take some interesting pictures that capture a wider frame, making for good landscape shots over distances. Although the images will still appear a bit dull, the extra room in the frame can add some character to images. However, as is the case with all wide-angle cameras, the edges of the frame will show some warping.  Low-light performance can be alright when shooting macro images and close-ups, but with subjects at a distance, you'll see a lot of grain in the images. Further, brightly lit parts of the image (such as street lights or lamps) tend to get overexposed.  Video looks decent, but the lack of stabilisation means that any video taken while moving will capture all the shakes. The front camera is alright as well, and adequate for video calls or the occasional selfie. On the whole, the camera setup on the Samsung Galaxy M10 is acceptable for the price, but you shouldn't expect too much from this phone. At Rs. 7,990 onwards, the Samsung Galaxy M10 is among Samsung's most affordable smartphones today. There are some big pros to this device, including its modern design and  a battery that will keep the phone going for well over a day with normal usage. Most of all, it's an affordable Samsung phone, which in itself makes this device important. However, this budget smartphone is far from perfect. The excellent battery life is a result of two big letdowns  the HD+ resolution screen and the dated SoC. While the shape and dimensions of the screen give this phone its modern look, the quality isn't quite as good as we'd have liked. Furthermore, performance on this device is below average, and the camera doesn't achieve a lot beyond its key feature of ultra-wide-angle photography.  The Samsung Galaxy M10 is a device for Samsung fans who are looking for a phone with a modern design, but options such as the Realme C1 (Review) and Xiaomi Redmi 6 (Review) are, in our opinion, more rounded devices at around the same price. If you do go for the Samsung Galaxy M10, we recommend that you get the 3GB RAM/ 32GB storage variant. Are Samsung Galaxy M10 and Galaxy M20 better than budget phones from Redmi, Realme, and Asus?

2450,21,samsung-m20-review-galaxy-m20-price-in-india-1985679,8,10,2019-03-13,1985679,Jamshed Avari,Samsung Galaxy M20 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/samsung-m20-review-galaxy-m20-price-in-india-1985679," Samsung has seen its number one market share position in India swallowed by Xiaomi, in exactly the same way that it overtook Nokia many years ago. The company has tried to respond in several different ways over the years, but very few of its recent low-cost offerings have been competitive enough in our reviews and ratings. The Korean giant has used its youth-focused J-series and software features such as S Bike Mode to address the budget market, but that just can't compare to the big screens, powerful processors, and tonnes of storage that Xiaomi and others offer at the same prices. It's finally time for a complete strategy reset, and so now we have the brand new Samsung Galaxy M-series. The two newly announced models, the Samsung Galaxy M10 (Review) and Samsung Galaxy M20, are launching in India before anywhere else, which shows how important it is for the company to recapture this market. Strategy aside, the new Galaxy M series represents a huge shift for the company in terms of design and specifications. There's no doubt that these phones are aimed squarely at Xiaomi, Honor, Realme, and Asus. It seems almost as though Samsung went out into the market with a checklist and tried to figure out every last little thing that these companies do in their perpetual race to one-up each other. Today, we have the more capable and higher priced of the two models, the Galaxy M20, for review. Let's find out whether Samsung's gamble has paid off, and whether it has finally managed to get the price, features, and performance right. Samsung Galaxy M10 Review    Put simply, this phone does not look or feel like any existing Samsung phone. It's extremely generic and could pass off for something from any of a handful of other manufacturers. Head-on, it's virtually indistinguishable from the Realme U1 (Review) or Oppo F9 (Review), for example. More than a criticism of Samsung though, this says more about how little scope there is for individuality when reducing a phone's features to such a degree of minimalism. The biggest departure from previous Samsung designs is the waterdrop-style 'Infinity-V' notch at the top of the screen, which is just big enough for the front camera to fit into. The screen measures 6.3 inches diagonally with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and rounded corners in keeping with current trends. There is a bit of a chin at the bottom of the screen — interestingly, if you place the Galaxy M20 and Galaxy M10 side by side, you'll see that they look identical except that the Galaxy M20 has a taller screen and narrower chin, for a screen-to-body ratio exceeding 90 precent. The top and side borders around the screen do look narrow, but the sides of this phone bulge outwards considerably. This helps allow the earpiece to be placed within the frame, above the screen notch. There is an ambient light sensor, but it can't be seen. The proximity sensor is to the left of the notch and that placement doesn't seem to have hurt its functionality. Both the Galaxy M20 and the Galaxy M10 will be sold in the same two colours, Ocean Blue and Charcoal Black. Our Galaxy M20 review unit is Ocean Blue, which does stand out. It's quite dark, with a glossy finish and a very fine grainy pattern that gives it some depth. Samsung hasn't said exactly what material it has used for the rear shell, but it feels plasticky.    The rear and sides of this phone are a single moulded shell with no seams or even antenna lines. We're happy to note that despite being glossy, the rear of this phone isn't slippery at all. The sides of this phone are rounded, but it is bulky overall, thanks to the 5000mAh battery — more on that in a bit. It's also quite thick and heavy, and we felt the weight after using it for extended periods. The Galaxy M10 is a lot lighter in comparison but it obviously doesn't have the huge battery. The Galaxy M20 has a USB Type-C port on the bottom, unlike the Micro-USB port on its less expensive sibling. The speaker grille is also on the bottom, whereas the Galaxy M10 has it on the lower rear. Another big difference between the two phones is that the Galaxy M20 has a fingerprint sensor on the rear — the less expensive model doesn't have one at all. We found the sensor a bit too high for our index fingers to reach comfortably when holding the phone. Everything else is fairly standard — there's a 3.5mm audio socket on the bottom, power and volume buttons on the right, and a tray on the left for two Nano-SIMs as well as a dedicated microSD card slot. The dual rear camera module has a tiny ridge around it to help prevent the lenses from getting scratched, but doesn't protrude at all. Overall, while the Samsung Galaxy M20 doesn't have much of an individual identity, it's more than good enough to take on its competition in the sub-Rs. 15,000 market. Every design choice has been made to support a feature that Samsung needs to offer.    The most interesting thing on the Galaxy M20's spec sheet is its brand new Exynos 7904 processor. This oddly named unit was launched less than two weeks ago, and was designed specifically for the value smartphone segment in India. It has two high-performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores running at 1.8GHz and six power-efficient ARM Cortex-A53 cores running at 1.6GHz, plus a Mali-G71 GPU. Samsung tends to use the same processors across a lot of models, sometimes over the course of several years. Since this is our first experience with the Exynos 7904, our benchmarks will tell us how it competes against the Qualcomm and MediaTek models that other manufacturers in this segment use. The Galaxy M20 is available with either 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage for Rs. 10,990, or 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage for Rs. 12,990. We have latter configuration for review, and a quick look at the market shows that many other models at this price level don't have as much RAM or storage, which could give Samsung an advantage. The rest of the specs are more commonly found in this price bracket. The screen resolution is 1080x2340, with a density of 409ppi. There's a 5000mAh battery, and Samsung says that the bundled 15W charger will fill it up quickly. Ten minutes of charging is supposed to be enough to enjoy three hours of videos or 11 hours of music playback. The primary rear camera is a 13-megapixel unit with an f/1.9 aperture, while the secondary camera has a 5-megapixel sensor and 120 degree field of view. The front camera has an 8-megapixel resolution. Dual VoLTE is supported, and you can use LTE on either SIM at any time.    Samsung seems to have cut a few corners when it comes to the accessories in the box. Other than the 15W charger and USB Type-C cable, there's only a SIM eject pin — there's no protective case or screen guard, and in a page out of the Xiaomi playbook, no headset. It's a little disappointing to see Android 8.1, but at least it was up to date with the January 2019 security patch at the time of our review. The Galaxy M20 runs the Samsung Experience UI, as the company's new One UI is still in its beta test phase. If you've used any recent Samsung phone, you won't find much that's new or different here. Unfortunately, another thing that hasn't changed is Samsung's eagerness to put ads everywhere. From the moment we first booted this phone, we were confronted by them. The entire lock screen is now an ad – Samsung has integrated an app called Glance that shows a different photo or promotional item each time you wake this phone from sleep. Not only are the captions distracting, but they displace useful notifications. In just the first few hours of using this phone we saw repeated clickbait messages to drive traffic to websites or apps. Sometimes we were prompted to vote in polls about cricketers or consumer product brands. Some of them were just flat out ads. We eventually managed to disable this by choosing ‘Wallpaper' rather than ‘Wallpaper & Stories' when setting a new lock screen background image, but we shouldn't have had to dig as much as we did to figure out this workaround. If we had bought this phone, we'd be extremely aggravated by this level of intrusiveness, and we really think Samsung needs to dial back its monetisation efforts. Besides that, we also got the usual barrage of notification spam from the My Galaxy app and some of the other preloaded apps. No matter how many useful extra features a manufacturer's custom UI has, this is the kind of thing that makes us long for stock Android. (L-R) Spammy notifications from the My Galaxy app; advertisement on the lock screen; customisation options for the Glance app.   We didn't have any trouble using the Samsung Galaxy M20 for day-to-day tasks. Apps and light games ran without any trouble, and we multitasked quite heavily too. There was only the slightest hint of lag in the UI on rare occasions, but not enough for us to worry about. Face recognition took about a second to work sometimes, which was annoying, but the fingerprint sensor was very quick. The screen is bright and crisp, with good viewing angles. Videos looked good and games including Asphalt 9:Legends and PUBG Mobile ran fine at medium settings. We did feel the upper rear of this phone get a bit warm while gaming, which is not ideal. Samsung's UI has also adapted well enough to the notch. Single-handed use was a bit difficult, owing to how large the phone is, and adjusting our grip was sometimes awkward because of its weight. We were curious to see how the new Exynos 7904 SoC does in benchmarks, and it delivered good enough performance for this segment. Our AnTuTu score was 107,540 which is in the neighbourhood of what Qualcomm's Snapdragon 632 or Snapdragon 636 can achieve. Geekbench gave us 1,315 for single-core performance and 4,094 for multi-core performance. Graphics scores were disappointing, with GFXbench's T-rex scene running at only 22fps and the Manhattan 3.1 scene at just 7.1fps. Battery life in everyday use was extraordinarily good. We started our day unplugging the phone at around 8am, and used it as usual, with a bit of photography and a few short gaming sessions, and still had about 60 percent left in the evening. We were able to stretch till the middle of the next day without having to charge. However, our HD video loop test ran for only 12 hours, 53 minutes which was relatively disappointing, and other phones in this price class do better with smaller batteries.    The camera app is easy to use and well laid out. Most options and modes are within easy reach, and it's always nice to be able to begin recording video with a single tap. We found that the camera was quick to lock focus and there didn't seem to be much shutter lag. There's a selector for the two cameras right above the shutter button, but it's easy to forget which camera is selected. The app remembers what you were using last, so it doesn't default back to the primary camera each time it's opened. You can enable a movable floating shutter button from the Settings, which could be useful. There are several stickers to choose from, including some that scale to faces automatically, and you can buy more through the Galaxy Apps store. The Pro mode is lacking in options – you can control only the metering, exposure compensation, ISO, and white balance. Samsung Mall integration lets you take photos of objects to search for similar ones across multiple online stores, and in our experience the results were pretty good but not very specific. One noteworthy quirk is that the Live Focus mode only works on faces. You can't use it to get a depth effect on shots of ordinary objects, like you can on virtually every other phone. There's a beautification mode but no AI enhancement, which is something that other brands, especially Honor, are using to differentiate themselves. Photo quality was fairly disappointing. We didn't see the kind of detail and sharpness that we're used to from phones in the sub-Rs. 15,000 price segment. Shots taken in the daytime were looked good on the phone's own screen, but a closer inspection showed that textures weren't very realistic and finer details were lost. On the positive side, all shots were all in focus and colours were fairly vibrant. Quality was also noticeably poorer when using the secondary camera with the wide lens, and there was a significant fish-eye distortion. Tap to see full-sized Samsung Galaxy M20 photo samples   Low-light performance was way below par. Very few of our shots came out looking usable, even when taken directly under streetlamps or with plenty of artificial light. There was a lot of motion blurring and a massive loss of detail. Video was also just about okay. Recording goes up to 1080p, and there's no stabilisation which is perhaps understandable at this price level. We saw quite a bit of focus shifting when recording moving objects. The depth effect in Live Focus mode made shots look quite artificial to us. It also didn't help that face beautification was on by default, and dialled up too high. Beautification was also enabled by default when we switched to the front camera. Speaking of which, selfies were also just about acceptable. Samsung Galaxy M20 in pictures   VerdictUnlike some of its current competitors, Samsung has immense brand power. A lot of people might have chosen other options recently based on specifications and features, so having closed that gap, Samsung stands to regain a lot of the customers it has lost. Buying a Samsung phone doesn't feel like a gamble in the way that it might with less established brands. The Korean giant is capitalising on this in its Galaxy M-series marketing by underscoring its huge service network, spanning 1,650 service centres across over 6,000 talukas all over India. We've reviewed the higher-end variant of the Samsung Galaxy M20, with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, which is priced at Rs. 12,990. At the same price, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro (Review) offers similar specifications with the roughly equivalent Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor and better battery life. The Realme U1 (Review) and Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 (Review) both have 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, but more powerful processors and also better battery life in our tests. The race between all these models is pretty tight. It seems that the Galaxy M20 doesn't quite catch up to all of its rivals' advantages, but at least it is very competitive for the first time. We hope this is the beginning of a new era for Samsung. Are Samsung Galaxy M10 and Galaxy M20 better than budget phones from Redmi, Realme, and Asus?

2461,21,samsung-m30-review-price-in-india-samsung-galaxy-m30-2005738,8,10,2019-03-11,2005738,Aditya Shenoy,Samsung Galaxy M30 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/samsung-m30-review-price-in-india-samsung-galaxy-m30-2005738," Samsung made it very clear at the launch of the Galaxy M series that this new series is targeted at young millennials, a market that has been captured by Chinese smartphone makers for a few years now. In order to recapture this audience, the Samsung M series phones have aggressive prices compared to older Samsung models, as well as notched displays, dual or triple camera setups, and big batteries. Samsung already has the Galaxy M10 (Review) and Galaxy M20 (Review) in the market catering to the sub-Rs. 10,000 and sub-Rs. 15,000 segments, and has now brought in the Galaxy M30 to recapture the Rs. 15,000 - 20,000 segment. While we already know how competitive the low-cost smartphone market can get, is the Samsung Galaxy M30 capable enough to take down the competition? We put it to the test to find out.    The Samsung Galaxy M30 is designed a lot like the Galaxy M10 and Galaxy M20. It has a teardrop notch at the top which Samsung refers to as the Infinity-U display. The phone sports a big 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with narrow bezels at the top and the sides and a thicker bottom chin. Samsung has moved the earpiece towards the frame of the phone, and it is as wide as the notch. Samsung has opted for a plastic unibody for the Galaxy M30, and offers it in two colours, Gradation Blue and Gradation Black. We had the Gradation Blue variant for review which had a nice blue gradient on the body. Samsung has curved the sides of the phone making it comfortable to hold in the hand. The corners are also rounded so they don't dig into your palms. The power and volume buttons are placed on the right of the Samsung Galaxy M30 and offer good clicky feedback. We found the power button to be well positioned, but reaching the volume buttons required a quick shuffle in the hand. To the left of the device is the SIM tray which has two Nano-SIM slots and a dedicated microSD card slot. The Gradation Blue colour variant of the Galaxy M30 has a beautiful gradient finish   At the top, the Samsung Galaxy M30 only has a microphone hole, while the 3.5mm headphone jack, USB Type-C port, and loudspeaker are placed at the bottom. The phone has an oval-shaped fingerprint scanner at the back which we felt is a little too high, making it inconvenient to reach. There is a triple camera setup at the back, which sits flush with the body. The selfie flash is placed right below the camera module. Samsung has managed to pack in a big 5000mAh battery while keeping the weight down to 172g. You get a 15W charger in the box which should be able to top the phone up relatively quickly. The Galaxy M30 sports a big 6.4-inch Super AMOLED display with a full-HD+ resolution (1080x2340 pixels). The panel is crisp, has good viewing angles, and is also legible when outdoors. It has a small notch in the centre of the top, which houses the selfie camera. While it is small in size, it might bother some people. You do have the option to mask it by enabling the Hide Camera option in the display settings. It puts a black bar on either side of the notch, but does not round the corners, which looks odd. The display settings on the Samsung Galaxy M30 can be tweaked and you can choose between Adaptive Display, AMOLED Cinema, AMOLED Photo, and Basic. We had the display in Adaptive Display mode all the time. This mode also lets you tweak the white balance and colour levels. The Galaxy M30 has two Nano-SIM slots and a dedicated microSD card slot   Powering the phone is an octa-core Samsung Exynos 7904 processor with two ARM Cortex-A73 cores clocked at 1.8GHz and six Cortex A-53 cores clocked at 1.6GHz. There are two variants of the Galaxy M30, one with 4GB RAM and 64GB of storage, and the other with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. You do have the option to expand storage by up to 512GB using the dedicated microSD card slot. Connectivity options for the Galaxy M30 include Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and GPS. It has an accelerometer, proximity sensor, gyroscope, and compass. The Galaxy M30 has two Nano-SIM slots and supports 4G as well as VoLTE on both SIMs. The Galaxy M30 comes with Samsung Experience 9.5 running on top of Android 8.1 Oreo which is a slightly dated version of Android. Our review unit had the February security patch, which is good, though we would've liked if Samsung shipped this phone with OneUI and Android Pie like it does on the Galaxy A30 which is priced slightly higher than the Galaxy M30. You get a few preinstalled apps from Samsung including Samsung Max, a data compression app; My Galaxy and the Galaxy Apps Store. We found the My Galaxy app to be spammy as it kept sending push notifications including ads and news. This got quite annoying as the phone would display four to six notifications a day on topics ranging from sports and news to movie promotions. We did not opt in for this and didn't find an option to disable them either. Ultimately, we had to disable the My Galaxy app to stop these notifications, which is far from ideal. Microsoft Office Mobile, OneDrive, LinkedIn, and a bunch of Google apps are also preinstalled. Samsung ships the Galaxy M30 with Android Oreo   While setting up the phone for the first time, it gave us a list of recommended apps to install, which we didn't. During setup it also asked us for permission to display lock screen stories — news stories, sponsored content, and more on the lock screen. It's easy to overlook this during setup and enable them by default, though at least you can disable these later if needed. We didn't enable Lock Screen Stories since we found these annoying when we reviewed the Samsung Galaxy M20. Samsung has baked in a few handy gestures. You can swipe down on the fingerprint scanner to pull the notification shade down, and swipe up to close it. You can double-tap to wake the display. Samsung's Chat Over Video feature lets you respond to notifications from some messaging apps such as WhatsApp in a pop-up window while watching a video. Gesture navigation is also available but it simply replaces the navigation buttons with swipe points. The Samsung Galaxy M30 has the same processor as the Galaxy M20 and we were expecting similar performance out of it. With day-to-day tasks, the phone showed no sign of slowing down or stuttering. We could multi-task easily with several apps in the background. The fingerprint scanner is quick to unlock the smartphone, and there's also face recognition which uses the selfie camera to unlock the phone. Face recognition isn't the fastest but does the job in most lighting conditions. Dolby Atmos is available but it can only be enabled when using headphones. We found the loudspeaker to be a little too soft when watching videos and playing games. To test gaming performance, we played PUBG Mobile which defaulted to the Medium preset with graphics set to Balanced and frame rate set to Medium. We noticed lag at these settings while playing the game, and changed the graphics setting to Smooth. This eliminated lag and the game was playable. After playing PUBG Mobile for 37 minutes we noticed that the phone was warm to the touch and the battery level had gone down by 9 percentage points. The triple camera setup on the Galaxy M30 sits flush with the back panel   We ran several benchmarks to test the performance of the Galaxy M30. It scored 1,07,495 in AnTuTu. In Geekbench 4, it managed 1,328 and 4,171 in the single-core and multi-core tests respectively. In comparison, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro scored 1,78,570 in AnTuTu and scored 2,389 and 6,593 in Geekbench 4's single-core and multi-core tests. The benchmark scores from the Galaxy M30 were also slightly lower than those of the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 which is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 SoC. The Galaxy M30 managed 22fps in GFXBench T-Rex and 7fps in GFXBench Manhattan 3.1. These scores are lower than the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro as well which is similarly priced. In terms of performance benchmarks, the Galaxy M30 scores less than some of the popular smartphones in this price range. This phone makes up for its average performance by offering good battery life. With a 5000mAh battery onboard, it can go on for a really long time without needing to be plugged in. With our usage, which consisted of using the Galaxy M30 for navigation for close to 5 hours, watching a couple of videos, and using an active Whatsapp account, the phone easily lasted for over a day and a half. In our HD video loop test, the Galaxy M30 clocked 17 hours and 4 minutes. This is a good time and is higher than that of the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 but the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro tops the Galaxy M30 at 19 hours and 23 minutes. When you finally do run out of power, the supplied fast charger is helpful. It managed to charge the phone to 23 percent in 30 minutes and 46 percent in an hour. It took over 2 hours to charge the phone completely. The Galaxy M30 has a USB Type-C port   The triple camera setup on the Galaxy M30 consists of a 13-megapixel primary camera with an f/1.9 aperture, a 5-megapixel depth sensor with an f/2.2 aperture, and a 5-megapixel ultra-wide-angle camera with a 123 degree field of view. For selfies, this phone has a 16-megapixel sensor with an f/2.0 aperture. Samsung's camera app is simple and easy to use. You'll find toggles laid out at the bottom while the different modes are at the top. The camera has Panorama, Pro, Beauty, Live Focus, Stickers, and Continuous Shot modes. In Pro mode, it lets you set exposure, ISO, and white balance before taking a shot, and Stickers lets you add AR stickers onto your subject. Live Focus puts the depth sensor to use and lets you set the level of background blur. You can use beautification filters and tweak multiple settings manually or enable Smart Beauty for the phone to manage beautification itself. Photos taken with the Galaxy M30 were on par with what we've seen from some of the other smartphones in this price range. The shots we took in the day were sharp and had good details. The phone was able to focus and set the exposure right. Objects at a distance were still visible. When shooting against the light, we observed chromatic aberration. The phone could manage good separation between subjects and backgrounds in macro shots. However, we noticed that the phone would aggressively boost the reds in shots, causing some of them to look artificial. Tap to see full-sized Samsung Galaxy M30 camera samples   The ultra-wide-angle sensor is useful to capture wider subjects or groups of subjects, but since it lacks autofocus it is best used for landscape shots. It did introduce barrel distortion in a few photos we took, but Samsung offers a shape correction option in the gallery to sort this out. This sensor, however, does not capture details as well as the primary sensor. Photos clicked with regular lens (top) and wide-angle lens (bottom) on the Samsung Galaxy M30, tap to see full-sized images   We shot some portraits using the Live Focus mode and were happy with the output. You can set the level of blur required, and the edge detection is good. You also get the option change the level of blur and add effects to these photos in the gallery. The low-light camera performance of the Galaxy M30 was average. Photos had low noise but there was fine grain This could be down to an aggressive noise reduction algorithm. Objects at a distance weren't very recognisable, but this is acceptable at this price. Selfies taken with the 16-megapixel front camera had good detail. We also used the Live Focus mode for a bokeh effect and in spite of there being only a single front camera, , the Galaxy M30 managed good edge detection. Video maxes out at 1080p for the primary camera but lacks stabilisation, which led to shaky results. Samsung Galaxy M30 in pictures   VerdictThe Samsung Galaxy M30 is the third smartphone from Samsung in the M series, and is priced well at Rs. 14,990 for the 4GB RAM variant and 17,990 for the higher 6GB RAM variant. It is one of a few smartphones at this price to sport a vivid Super AMOLED panel, which we liked. We also found the big battery very helpful as we could stay away from the charger a lot longer than usual. The cameras are good in daylight but could do with a few tweaks for better low-light photography. We were hoping for the new OneUI with Android Pie on the Galaxy M30 and were disappointed to find the older Samsung Experience UI along with Android Oreo. For the asking price, the Galaxy M30 is not a bad option, but if you want better performance rather than features, you can take a look at the Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 Pro which offers seriously good value along with the Realme U1 (Review) and the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 (Review). Are the affordable Realme 3 and Samsung Galaxy M30 smartphones worth buying?

2477,21,samsung-s10e-review-galaxy-india-price-2014583,9,10,2019-03-29,2014583,Roydon Cerejo,Samsung Galaxy S10e Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/samsung-s10e-review-galaxy-india-price-2014583," For the past couple of years, Samsung has typically had two flagship S series smartphones at launch — a regular and a Plus version. This year, the company introduced a third variant called the Galaxy S10e. Going by the US pricing, the Galaxy S10e seems to be aimed directly at the iPhone XR (Review). In India, thanks to Samsung's local manufacturing, we're able to get it closer to the dollar value while the iPhone XR comes in at a steep premium. At Rs. 55,900, the Galaxy S10e is a good Rs. 10,000 cheaper than the standard Galaxy S10, and there's really no other 2019 Android flagship in India at this price right now. The Galaxy S10e has also been receiving rave reviews on the Internet, so it's finally time for us to see if it actually lives up to the hype.    The Galaxy S10e is the smallest and lightest of the three new Galaxy S10 models at 150g. It's 0.1mm thicker than the others, which is practically impossible to tell, even when placed alongside the other two. What we really love is the size of this phone. It feels incredibly comfortable to hold and the rounded edges aren't abrasive on the skin. The aluminium and glass back is a bit slippery when used with one hand, and this phone does attract fingerprints easily. Even though it feels sturdy, the aluminium frame will pick up permanent scuffs if you drop this phone. For instance, we were crouching to take some photos of a flower at one point, and the phone slipped from our hand, from less than waist height and tumbled onto a tiled floor. The glass remained intact but the top of the frame bore the brunt of the impact, leaving behind a permanent mark. The Samsung Galaxy S10e has Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back   The Galaxy S10e has a Bixby button just like its siblings, which can be programmed to trigger other functions too. You can set the double-press or single-press actions to either launch an app or trigger a Bixby Routine, but launching the Bixby assistant has to be one of the other choices. Unlike the ultrasonic fingerprint sensors in the more premium Galaxy S10 models, the Galaxy S10e has a standard capacitive one integrated into its power button on the right. It's highly sensitive, and even a quick touch is enough to unlock the phone. You can also enable gestures for easier access to the notification shade. While it works well, we do think the placement of the power button is a bit too high up, and we found it to be a little hard to reach when holding the phone normally. The Samsung Galaxy S10e has a 5.8-inch full-HD+ Dynamic AMOLED display. The resolution is lower than that of the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ (Review) but you still get a pretty dense pixel count of 438ppi. Thankfully, Samsung hasn't stripped the HDR 10+ certification for the display, so you can still enjoy high dynamic range colours in compatible videos. The default colour profile can make colours look a bit too saturated but you can switch to the ‘Natural' colour profile if you prefer. One of the big design differences with the Galaxy S10e is the lack of a curved display edges on the left and right side. Instead, the display is flat. Another little difference is that the Galaxy S10e has slightly thicker bezels on the sides and the top compared to the other two, although this didn't really bother us. The Samsung Galaxy S10e's hole-punch can be masked with some clever wallpapers   One area where Samsung has cut some corners is the level of scratch protection for the glass. The Galaxy S10e has Gorilla Glass 5 on the front and back, whereas its bigger siblings have Gorilla Glass 6 on the front and Gorilla Glass 5 on the back. While Gorilla Glass 5 still is certified to withstand scratches and small drops, the newer version on the other two Galaxy S10 models should offer better shatter resistance. You also get a screen guard pre-applied, which we found annoying since the edges feel rough when you swipe in from either side of the display. At the back of the phone, we noticed some more cutbacks compared to other Galaxy S10 models. The Galaxy S10e ditches the telephoto camera so you only get the main dual-aperture, 12-megapixel sensor and the 16-megapixel ultra-wide angle one. These are the exact same sensors found in the other two models, though. Another thing that's missing is the heart-rate sensor, which in our books is not a big loss. The Samsung Galaxy S10e is only available in Prism Black and Prism White in India. The bundled accessories include an AKG-tuned headset, USB-OTG Type-C to Type-A adapter, fast charger, data cable, SIM eject tool and warranty information. What's interesting is that you get a much better looking plastic case with this model, compared to a transparent, hard-plastic shell with the other two. Even though this is the most affordable phone in Samsung's flagship lineup, there's nothing low-end about its specifications. In India, the Galaxy S10e ships with the 8nm Exynos 9820 octa-core SoC, but there's only one variant here, with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. Internationally, an option with 256GB storage and 8GB of RAM is also available. Other specifications that are standard across all Galaxy S10 models include a hybrid dual-SIM slot, Gigabit LTE and dual 4G VoLTE support, Wi-Fi 802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6), Bluetooth 5, NFC, support for four satellite navigation systems, and USB Type-C. The Galaxy S10e also features AKG-tuned stereo speakers with Dolby Atmos, an IP68 certification for dust and water resistance, and a whole bunch of sensors. Samsung's new One UI 1.1 is based on Android 9 Pie. The security patch on our review unit was dated February 2019. We've recently reviewed a number of Samsung phones with One UI, so it didn't take long to get accustomed to the interface. The Samsung Galaxy S10e runs on One UI, which is based on Android 9 Pie   There are a whole bunch of optional gestures and shortcuts, and Apps Edge lets you add shortcuts for commonly used apps to a bar that can be accessed from the home screen with a simple swipe gesture. You can get rid of the standard Android navigation buttons in favour of gestures, which are not bad. Google's Digital Wellbeing feature can help you keep tabs on your app usage habits. We've covered the software of the Galaxy S10+ in great detail in our full review and gaming review and it's identical here, so do check those stories out. The Galaxy S10e isn't free from spammy notifications cluttering up your notification shade, but there is a way to minimise disruption by unchecking some of the ‘terms and conditions' boxes when setting up the phone and using Samsung's stock apps and features like Bixby for the first time. Despite all these precautions, we were still getting prompts from the My Galaxy app before we even opened it. The number of notifications wasn't huge, but we wish there was a way to disable it completely. The Galaxy S10e is the ideal size for comfortable single-handed use. Reaching the notification shade is still a bit of a stretch but not by much. Despite the compact body, you don't sacrifice on the size of the display either. The hole-punch for the front camera isn't too distracting after a day of using this phone, and you can have some fun with it with clever wallpapers designed to mask it. You can mask the entire top of the display if you like, but then you lose out on some screen space. The fingerprint sensor works well but since it's capacitive, there are limitations, such as it won't work if your fingers are wet or greasy. You don't have to press the power button as a simple touch is enough to unlock the phone, which is nice. Samsung has gotten rid of the iris scanner that previous Galaxy S flagship models had, due to the lack of space in the hole-punch area. Even though there's face recognition, it's not as good as Apple's Face ID as the phone relies on just the selfie camera for authentication. It works well, and is triggered as soon as you raise the phone towards your face. In low-light, the screen bumps up the brightness briefly to illuminate your face. However, face recognition did not work for us when we had sunglasses on. The Samsung Galaxy S10e features a capacitive fingerprint sensor on the right   General app and UI performance is great, just like with the other two Galaxy S10 models. Despite have 2GB less RAM than the others, we didn't notice any major differences in benchmark numbers. With regular use, we did find that the sides of the phone got warm rather quickly, at times even when we were simply downloading apps from the Play Store. It's not a consistent issue, and if you're using a case you probably won't notice it. Games ran very well, even high-end ones such as PUBG Mobile. Thanks to the powerful SoC and lower screen resolution, the Galaxy S10e easily managed to drive them at the highest settings. Framerates were smooth, and the One UI's Game Launcher lets you enable Dolby Atmos when playing games, which gives you better spatial separation of gunfire and footsteps. The AMOLED display is great for watching content on. Streaming apps such as Netflix and Prime Video will automatically align video to avoid the hole-punch area when you zoom in, but if the camera cutout doesn't bother you, you can force the apps to go full-screen from the Display Settings, which will fill the area around the selfie camera. The stereo speakers get really loud too, with good definition and stereo separation. The Galaxy S10e has the exact same front and rear cameras as the other two Galaxy S10 models, minus the telephoto sensor and the front RGB depth sensor from the Galaxy S10+. Unsurprisingly, the performance is quite similar too. The phone captures detailed landscapes and macros in daylight, with good dynamic range and colours. The scene optimiser automatically recognised objects such as sneakers, t-shirts, etc, and tried its best to enhance our shots. Macros came out looking highly detailed and exposure was handled very well. Colours can seem a little boosted at times, especially for objects like flowers. The camera app is easy to use and has a novice-friendly layout. The toggle to switch between the regular and wide-angle sensors is within reach of your thumb, and you can flip through the shooting modes by simply swiping across the viewfinder. There are plenty of modes, for both stills and videos, which we've covered in detail in our Galaxy S10+ review. The wide-angle sensor is particularly useful since you can capture more elements in a frame, although a bit of barrel distortion is visible at times. Shot using the primary 12-megapixel sensor   Shot using the 16-megapixel ultra wide-angle sensor on the Samsung Galaxy S10e   Tap to see full-sized Samsung Galaxy S10e camera samples   Live focus works well, with good edge detection. You can even add background blur effects. The 10-megapixel selfie camera is also a big improvement over those of the Galaxy Note 9 (Review) and Galaxy S9 series, as we've already highlighted in our recent camera comparison. Despite not having an RGB depth sensor like the Galaxy S10+, the S10e does a pretty decent job with detecting edges in selfies. There were a few occasions when it missed or blurred out things it shouldn't have, but these are minor problems that didn't ruin our shots. Video recording hasn't been compromised on this Galaxy S10 series model either. You can shoot at up to 4K at 60fps just like with the more expensive models, and you get the same Super Slow-mo video mode that lets you shoot at 960fps. Video quality is very good in daylight, especially the captured audio. Stabilisation is handled well, and colours appear punchy. Even in low light, noise is kept under control. Our test clips had good details and colours, and only showed very minor side-effects of electronic stabilisation. The Galaxy S10e has a 3100mAh battery, which is the smallest of the series, and that has a noticeable effect in everyday use. We typically managed to get roughly 17 to 18 hours of actual battery life, which would typically involve a bit of camera use and video viewing but mostly Internet surfing and chat apps. This is still good as you can comfortably get through a full work day, but it isn't enough to go past the 24 hour mark. The good news is that the battery charges really quickly with the bundled charger. With roughly 5 percent remaining, we were able to get to a 95 percent charge in an hour, which is impressive. The phone also supports fast wireless charging with a compatible wireless charger, as well as reverse wireless charging, so you can charge accessories such as the Galaxy Buds on the go. In our HD video battery loop test, the Galaxy S10e ran for 10 hours and 31 minutes, which is decent, but could have been better. VerdictThe Galaxy S10e might not have all the frills of the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+, but at Rs. 55,900 it retains a lot of the features and style of the other two, making it very good value. In India, it's a much better deal than the iPhone XR, not only in terms of features, but also cost. The closest competition to the Galaxy S10e at the moment seems to be the Google Pixel 3 (Review), which can be found for roughly Rs. 58,000 online. The latter is still a good buy if you want the stock Android experience, a compact form-factor and a good set of cameras. Let's not forget the OnePlus 6T (Review), which has been a long time favourite of enthusiasts. The top-end version of this phone is available at Rs. 45,999 which gets you 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. Plus, battery life should be better than the Galaxy S10e too. However, what you'll miss out on is the HDR display, compact size, proper waterproofing, and a more modern SoC. After using the Galaxy S10e for a couple of days, we can see why this phone has garnered so much praise from the media and fans alike. You get most of the guts of the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10+ in a body that's a lot more compact and manageable. Battery life is not as good as it is with the other models, and you lose the telephoto camera and in-display fingerprint sensor, so if these things matter, then it makes sense spending that extra money for either of those two phones. Overall, we think most people will be more than satisfied with the features and performance of the Galaxy S10e, especially at this price. Is Samsung Galaxy S10+ the best Android flagship overall? Are Samsung Galaxy Buds the best truly wireless headphones in India?

2268,21,vivo-nex-review-india-1886024,8,10,2018-07-19,1886024,Shobhit Varma,Vivo Nex Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/vivo-nex-review-india-1886024," Ever since we first saw them, screen notches have been a contentious issue in smartphone design. What cannot be denied is that the notch is a compromise - conceived in order to make the narrow-bordered smartphones of today a reality. The front camera, earpiece and sensors have to go somewhere, and notches have so far been the solution. In order to get rid of the notch, Vivo has made some bold and risky design choices. The fingerprint scanner has found its way beneath the display, and the front camera is housed in a pop-up mechanism. The earpiece has also been replaced with a motor that vibrates the front glass, and the ambient light sensor lives below the display. The Nex is undoubtedly Vivo's most ambitious smartphone to date. It has been priced at Rs. 44,990 in India and is definitely one of the most unique smartphones available right now. Can it compete with flagships such as the Samsung Galaxy S9 (Review), OnePlus 6 (Review), and Asus's recently launched ZenFone 5Z (Review)? Let's find out in our full review.    Let's cut to the chase - the Vivo Nex is the most beautiful smartphone that Vivo has ever released. As with all 2018 flagships, you get a premium blend of glass and metal. The glass back has a grey speckled pattern and strikes the right compromise between bling and subtlety. There are no other colour options. The build quality is top-notch, and this phone feels incredibly solid in the hand. With no notch on the display, the front fascia has a seamless look. There is a slim chin at the bottom, and a faint border around other sides of the display, but it still looks impressive. Weighing in at 199g with dimensions of 162x77x7.98mm, the Vivo Nex is quite a hefty phone, bordering on phablet territory. It's far too wide and tall to be used comfortably with one hand. In fact, we found it slightly cumbersome to use even with both hands. The rear is extremely slippery and we ended up dropping the Nex more than a couple of times during our testing period. It's also a major fingerprint magnet.    The USP of the Vivo Nex is the pop-up module for the 8-megapixel front camera. It takes one second to rise, and is accompanied by a slightly cheesy sci-fi sound, which thankfully can be turned off. It is a novelty to play around with at first. Given the additional moving parts, the question of long-term durability comes in. While the mechanism feels quite solid and does not wobble in the slightest, we cannot know for sure how well it will stand up to regular use and abuse until the phone starts selling and people get to use it for extended periods. We are also worried about how badly this phone could get damaged if it falls with the camera module extended. As stated above, the fingerprint sensor is integrated into the display glass, and it works well enough but is not in the same league as the physical ones we have become used to. The CMOS sensor is located a little above the on-screen home button, and the display shows an icon to guide you where to place your finger. The placement is convenient and we got used to touching the fingerprint icon on the screen very easily. The learning curve is not as steep as expected and touching the screen to unlock the phone became a part of our normal routine in no time. It's quicker than the in-display sensor on the Vivo X21 (Review), which was the first smartphone in the world with this feature, but accuracy is still spotty. It works well 8 out of 10 times on average, and when it doesn't, the novelty turns into an irritant. The setup process is also slow and cumbersome. It takes multiple tries at times for your fingerprint to be recognised, and the angle has to be just right.    Vivo has also done away with a normal earpiece and has instead replaced it with a motor that vibrates the display glass itself. Vivo calls this technology Screen SoundCasting, and it works much the same as bone conduction. The technology is definitely impressive but it needs a lot of work to be a viable solution. We found it hard to hear callers, with their voices coming across as muffled and indistinct. This really impacts day-to-day use and is a major irritant. The power and volume buttons on the right edge are ergonomically placed. On the left is an 'AI' button, which can be be pressed once to invoke Google Lens, or long-pressed to call on Google Assistant. We would have liked it to be re-mappable to perform any other function. The USB Type-C port at the bottom is flanked by a loudspeaker and the SIM tray, which has separate slots for two Nano-SIM cards. There is no microSD slot. The single loudspeaker gets reasonably loud but is very shrill and tinny. At a time when most flagships feature capable stereo speakers, such lacklustre sound just does not cut it. In what is surely a direct result of the pop-up front-facing camera, the Vivo Nex is neither waterproof nor dustproof, so potential buyers should be careful with this smartphone. Vivo includes a high-quality case with a rubber finish on the top, which feels good in the hand. The box also contains a fast charger, a USB Type-C cable, and a pair of earphones that sound surprisingly good. The dual-SIM Vivo Nex is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor, coupled with 8GB of RAM. The 128GB of internal storage should be more than enough for most buyers, but it is sadly not expandable. The Vivo Nex features a 4,000mAh battery that supports Vivo's proprietary fast charging protocol. There's a 6.59-inch full-HD+ (1080x2316 pixels) Super AMOLED display with a 19.3:9 aspect ratio. This phone also runs FuntouchOS 4.0 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo. There is no official news regarding an Android P update yet.    The smartphone has connectivity options including dual 4G VoLTE, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11 ac, Bluetooth 5, GPS/ A-GPS, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. This phone supports dual SIMs (Nano) and both can simultaneously latch onto 4G networks. The 6.59-inch Super AMOLED display is the star of the show here. With a screen-to-body ratio of 93 percent, it dominates the front of the smartphone and looks striking. The viewing angles are superb, colours are vivid, and blacks are inky and deep. The maximum brightness is impressive, and the display also gets dim enough for comfortable use in a dark room. There is a nifty night mode that that can be triggered at set times. A Quad-HD display would have been the icing on the cake, but the lack of pixels is only really noticeable on extremely text-heavy screens. Vivo has moved the ambient light sensor to below the display and it works well enough. We had no problems with it during our review period. Apart from a few software niggles that we'll get to in a moment, performance was pretty much top-notch. With the Snapdragon 845 under the hood, the Vivo Nex handled everything from simple day-to-day tasks to intensive workloads with ease. With 8GB of RAM, our review unit kept most apps running in the background, even those left unused for a full day. Gaming on the phone is also quite a pleasurable experience. Games like Asphalt 8 look gorgeous on the 19.3:9 screen and run flawlessly, with minimal load times and no lag or stutter to speak of. As always, we put the Vivo Nex through benchmark tests and found that it scored 262,553 in AnTuTu 7; just shy of the OnePlus 6's score of 268,385. It also scored 33fps in GFXBench Car Chase, 55fps in GFXBench Manhattan 3.1, and 2,457 and 9,119 in Geekbench 4's single-core and multi-core tests respectively. Vivo's Funtouch OS has taken a lot of inspiration from iOS. There is no app drawer, and there is even a Control Center which houses all the quick toggles that are usually found in the notifications shade. The OS is reasonably fluid and snappy, and is loaded with features. There's a lot going on in terms of gestures and shortcuts, and many of them are inspired by the iPhone X (Review). The navigation gestures are a bit of a mixed bag. While most of them are smooth and easy to use, the gesture to invoke recent apps, which requires holding the screen and then sliding up, is choppy and very slow. The iOS-like Control Center, cluttered settings menu, and pre-installed apps   Then there are other gestures such as turning on the flashlight by shaking the phone, launching apps by tracing alphabets on the screen when it is off, and answering calls by lifting the phone to your ear. The sheer number of these gestures and customisation options will be appreciated by some, but many users could just get overwhelmed. We experienced multiple app crashes throughout our review period, and some applications refused to play well with the Vivo Nex's 19.3:9 screen aspect ratio. The user interface is also in need of simplification. For example, there are 35 submenus in the Settings app and there's no search function. The amount of bloat is also disappointing, especially for a flagship smartphone. Newspoint, UC Browser, Amazon, WPS Office, Amazon Prime Video, PhonePe and Facebook are preinstalled. Thankfully, all of them can be removed. The Vivo Nex does not offer face recognition. The Oppo Find X, which has many similarities to the Vivo Nex, does have this feature despite its sliding camera mechanism. With the fingerprint scanner acting up at times, we missed face recognition as a quick way to unlock our phone. Battery life is quite fantastic, and we never had any anxiety about running out of power. We got through a 12-hour day with about 40 percent left at the end, which is quite impressive. Our usage involved around two hours of navigation using Google Maps, frequent use of social media applications including WhatsApp and Twitter, games such as Asphalt 8, and taking a dozen or so selfies and photos. Our HD video loop test ran for a solid 16 hours and 23 minutes, which is one of the best scores we have seen in this segment. The huge fast charger that Vivo includes in the box takes the phone from zero to about 50 percent in 40-45 minutes, which is handy, but slower than OnePlus's Dash Charge system. On the imaging front, Vivo's flagship smartphone has a dual rear camera setup with a 12-megapixel IMX363 primary sensor and four-axis OIS, along with a 5-megapixel secondary sensor. The front camera has an 8-megapixel resolution. As stated above, its mechanism takes about a second to pop up. We were not really bothered by this, but selfie enthusiasts who love capturing spontaneous moments might find this a bit frustrating. We were quite impressed with the quality of photos taken with the rear camera. The level of detail was impressive, colours were rich and vibrant, and the autofocus was precise and accurate. There was also little to no shutter lag, and the dynamic range was good. Thanks to the four-axis OIS, images taken at night also came out sharp and detailed. As with most flagships these days, the rear camera can recognise objects or scenes being shot and optimise its settings accordingly. Some people might find the colours to be overexaggerated, and might prefer more neutral tones. The portrait mode is also slightly iffy, with sub-standard edge detection around objects. Tap to see full-sized Vivo Nex camera samples   The selfie camera is a disappointment. Not only is it laggy, but it also has a tendency to overexpose shots. It captures a decent amount of detail in well-lit situations but struggles in low-light. Images taken at night look very soft and have a fair bit of noise. There is a beautify mode in the camera app which works pretty much as you would expect. AR stickers are implemented well and are a good way to impress friends. They can be used with both the front and the rear camera. There is a fully featured professional mode in the camera application as well which allows you to alter the ISO, exposure, shutter speed and white balance. Video recording maxes out at 1080p for the front camera, while the rear one is capable of 4K video recording. Videos shot with the rear cameras are detailed and quite stable, thanks to the four axis optical image stabilisation. Slow-motion video is capped at 1080p. The resultant videos are quite good but we did experience flickering in unfavourable light. Vivo Nex in pictures   VerdictThe Vivo Nex is a smartphone from the future which is gorgeous, immensely powerful, and loaded with impressive technologies. The OLED screen is superb, the rear camera is competent, and battery life is impressive. However, the software has niggles, the fingerprint scanner is unreliable, calls are hard to hear, and many flagship features such as waterproofing and wireless charging are conspicuous by their absence. In fact, these issues overshadow the phone's powerful processor. Even though the Nex has a lot going for it, we would advise buyers to hold off until all the technology matures and the day-to-day annoyances are sorted out. Flagship offerings from the likes of Apple, OnePlus, and Samsung are more polished and easier to live with. As of now, the Vivo Nex is best looked upon as a technology showcase, rather than owned as a daily driver. However, if you can live with the compromises, it does deliver a certain excitement. The Vivo Nex is far from perfect, and using it can get quite frustrating at times, but it is undeniably desirable. Are Vivo Nex and Oppo Find X revolutionary phones or overpriced prototypes?

2394,21,vivo-v11-pro-review-performance-battery-life-price-in-india-25990-1913475,8,10,2018-09-12,1913475,Roydon Cerejo,Vivo V11 Pro Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/vivo-v11-pro-review-performance-battery-life-price-in-india-25990-1913475," A couple of years ago, the smartphone industry was struck by the selfie frenzy, and pretty much every manufacturer began selling selfie-focused models. Among the crowd, Oppo’s F series and Vivo’s V series have stood the test of time, as both companies continue to iterate and refresh them. The company's latest offering is the Vivo V11 Pro, an iterative update to the Vivo V9 (Review) which was launched about six months ago. This is the first V series phone to sport an in-display fingerprint sensor, which debuted on the Vivo X21 (Review). In many ways, the Vivo V11 Pro is like a selfie-centric version of the X21, and apart from the fingerprint sensor, it also has similar specifications as its higher-end sibling. Priced at Rs. 25,990, does the V11 Pro have enough to differentiate itself from its rivals? Let’s find out in our Vivo V11 Pro review.    Given the fact that there’s only been a short interval between the launches of the Vivo V9 and V11 Pro, it’s no surprise that the new model looks pretty much identical to its predecessor. The buttons, SIM tray, ports, and even the rear camera module have virtually identical placements. This phone is also very light thanks to its all-plastic body, and is easy to manage with one hand. It's as thick as the V9, at 7.9mm, but is slightly taller, so it might feel more bulky in your pocket. The glossy back also attracts smudges very easily. The larger body makes room for a bigger display, which measures 6.41 inches diagonally. Vivo is calling this a ‘Halo FullView’ display since it has slim borders on all sides and a really tiny notch. The latter is similar to what we just saw on the Oppo F9 Pro (Review). Since there’s only room for the front camera, the sensors have been moved into the edge of the bezel to the right of the camera, while the earpiece is cleverly placed just above it. The V11 Pro comes with a screen protector pre-installed, but it also has Gorilla Glass 3 reinforcement. This is the 'Starry Night' colour option of the Vivo V11 Pro   The display has a healthy full-HD+ resolution which brings the total pixel count to just over 400ppi. Images and text look sharp, and the Super AMOLED panel ensures vivid colours and deep backs. The AMOLED panel is a prerequisite for having an in-display fingerprint sensor. You now get the option to select from three different animation styles for the authentication process. A fingerprint logo lights up when motion is detected so you know where to place your finger, but authentication isn’t very quick. It takes a full second or two before the phone unlocks. In contrast, face recognition was lightning quick, and worked well for us even under low light. It doesn’t work if your eyes are closed, which makes it a little more secure. For added safety, you can opt for a combination of face and fingerprint authentication. The V11 Pro gets some new colour options. Our unit had a dual-tone finish called Starry Night, with a black upper half that transitions into a glittery blue lower half. This phone is also available in Dazzling Gold. In the box, you get a silicone case, a SIM eject tool, a headset, a Micro-USB cable, and a fast-charge capable power adapter. The Vivo V11 Pro is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 mobile platform, and has 6GB of RAM, just like the Vivo X21. Most of this phone's benchmark numbers were a bit lower compared to the X21, and AnTuTu wouldn’t run to completion, so we couldn’t get a score. The phone has 64GB of storage, which is expandable by up to 256GB. You also get dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 5, USB-OTG, GPS, and FM radio, but no NFC. Sensors include an ambient light sensor, virtual gyroscope, proximity sensor, and a compass. To compensate for the lack of a notification LED, you can enable the always-on display, which shows you the time, date, battery level, and app icons for any incoming notifications. However, the notifications are passive, which means you can’t interact with them the way Samsung and many others allow. You also don’t get any controls on the always-on display when music is playing. Funtouch OS on the Vivo V11 Pro offers plenty of customisation options   Vivo’s Funtouch OS is now at version 4.5, and is based on Android 8.1 Oreo. It’s quite different from stock Android so there is a learning curve if this is your first Vivo phone. The leftmost home screen is dedicated to the Smart Launcher, which shows you calendar events, the weather, a step counter, and shortcuts for your favourite apps. You can change the theme using the iTheme app and download apps from Vivo’s own app store. There are plenty of preinstalled apps too, such as NewsPoint, UC Browser, social media apps, and WPS Office. These can be removed if you don’t want them. The Control Centre window, which you access by swiping upwards from the bottom of the display, has a toggle for Bike mode. With this, you can filter out which calls to accept or reject and also respond to them with a custom SMS. Jovi is Vivo’s AI engine, which works across a couple of different usage scenarios. Within the camera app, there's automatic beautification in selfies as well as object and scene detection. It’s also found in the Smart Launcher, where it prompts you with nearby events or weather information based on your location. Finally, there’s Game mode, which gives you toggles within a game for muting notifications, auto-rejecting incoming calls, etc. You also get a whole bunch of motion gestures, a one-handed mode, scrolling screenshots, and the ability to clone certain apps. The Jovi AI engine in the V11 Pro has its use in games, camera app and in the Smart Launcher   The OS is definitely feature-rich but it still has some of the same quirks we've pointed out in the past few versions. There’s a universal search function on the home screen, but we still don’t have one for the Settings app. The fact that the items within the Settings app have been moved around makes it difficult to find what you’re looking for. There's also a mysterious bug in the Settings app that for some reason shows the word 'Hovered' on screen when you try to swipe downwards to scroll.    Vivo hasn’t given users any way to mask the area around the notch. In games, the prominent curves of the edges often obscure content, and if you don’t have a game running fullscreen in landscape mode, it will look flat on one side and rounded on the other, which is quite awkward. We see a new version of Funtouch OS with nearly every new phone that Vivo releases, but the company doesn't seem to be paying attention to these little details. As a result, the software continues to feel a bit unpolished. Finally, the V11 Pro also has something called FunMoji, which can be accessed through the TouchPal keyboard. It’s the closest we’ve see to Apple’s Animoji in terms of the quality of characters, but it doesn’t pick up subtle expressions and the tracking still is a bit jerky. The heavy customisations to Android thankfully haven’t taken a toll on performance. The interface is snappy, and multitasking is handled very well. The display has very good touch response, although it does wash out a little under direct sunlight. We didn’t encounter any heating issues when using the GPS or downloading apps, but this phone does get fairly warm with a lot of camera use and when playing taxing games. Speaking of games, the Snapdragon 660 doesn’t have the best GPU, which is why titles like PUBG and Asphalt 9: Legends run at medium to low settings by default. Bumping up the graphics in PUBG caused a bit of stutter in gameplay, and Asphalt 9 had terrible jagged edges even with the graphics forced to the ‘High’ preset. The Vivo V11 Pro has one of the smallest notches on any phone   The primary rear camera has a 12-megapixel sensor and f/1.8 aperture lens. It supports dual pixel autofocus but doesn't have optical stabilisation. Just like the X21, the V11 Pro locked focus very quickly without any hunting issues. Even when panning or shifting focus between subjects, it locked focus nearly instantaneously. This slowed down a bit in very low light, but not by much. The Auto HDR worked very well too, balancing the exposure of  dark and bright areas well. There was also no perceptible shutter lag under good light, which made shooting challenging subjects like pets a bit easier. The detail level and colours in landscapes were very good, and close-ups had a smooth bokeh effect. Noise was handled very well in low light too, while preserving details even in objects at a great distance. Tap to see full-sized Vivo V11 Pro camera samples   The quality of 4K video recorded under natural light was good, but it got a little grainy in low light. Video resolutions are a bit limited, as your only other choices are 1080p and 720p. There's nothing in between, like a 60fps mode. One feature that we really missed was electronic stabilisation, which we hope is addressed through an update in the future. The second 5-megapixel sensor is used for gauging depth. This kicks in when you switch to bokeh mode. You can vary the effective aperture through software, but edge detection wasn't great. The 25-megapixel selfie camera is still one of the best we’ve seen in this segment. Images are sharp and well exposed, and you get to play around with a couple of lighting modes similar to what the iPhone X offers. The AIFace Beauty shooting mode automatically applies filters, which can be manually tweaked if they are not to your liking. AR stickers are fun to play around with too. The camera app is easy to master but the layout isn’t perfect. It takes a while to get to the shooting mode you want, as you need to swipe through each one and wait for the viewfinder to adapt to that mode before you can move to the next. Secondly, when shooting in landscape mode, the camera settings don’t switch orientation, which is really annoying. AI scene recognition can figure out a bunch of different objects and scenes but it takes a while. We didn’t notice much of a difference in image quality with it on or off. The AI Portrait Framing feature is handy for novice users, as it prompts you to reposition the camera if your subject is not in the centre of the frame. Heavy camera use does drain the battery quickly but otherwise, with regular usage, we easily managed to get through an entire day or a bit more. A single round of PUBG, which typically lasts about 30 minutes, knocked 11 percent off the battery meter. The phone supports Vivo’s Dual Engine fast charging technology which gives you roughly a 42 percent charge in 30 minutes, and around 80 percent in an hour. This seems to be based on Qualcomm’s Quick Charge technology, as the phone charges quickly when connected to a Quick Charge-compatible adapter. VerdictThe Vivo V11 Pro is a solid all-rounder at Rs. 25,990 and offers better value than the Oppo F9 Pro (Review), but for a bit more money. Think of it as a Vivo X21 with a bigger battery and better front camera, but at a much more reasonable price, which is a good recipe. Obviously, it’s hard to ignore the Poco F1 (Review) at this price level, but getting your hands on one is likely to be difficult for a while, whereas the V11 Pro should have better online and offline availability. Then there’s the Nokia 7 Plus (Review) — a phone that has very similar specifications as the V11 Pro, but with the allure of stock Android One and much better construction quality. There are some aspects of the Vivo V11 Pro that we wish were different. A USB Type-C port would have been preferable, the in-display fingerprint sensor still feels a bit sluggish, electronic stabilisation is missing, and the custom OS could use more polish. Overall, though, the V11 Pro offers a good mix of features and performance at a competitive price."
2487,21,vivo-v15-review-india-price-2016157,7,10,2019-04-02,2016157,Nadeem Sarwar,Vivo V15 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/vivo-v15-review-india-price-2016157," Lately, Vivo has been looking to make a mark by bringing innovative features from high-end smartphones to the mid-range segment. The company's latest offering — the Vivo V15 — brings the innovative pop-up selfie camera to an even lower price bracket. On paper, the Vivo V15 appears to be a solid device with an attractive design, three rear cameras, a large battery, fast charging, and a high-resolution 32-megapixel front camera. The Vivo V15 certainly has an uphill task in the face of fierce competition not just from value-for-money champions such as Xiaomi and Asus, but also from Samsung, a behemoth whose new Galaxy M-series and A-series smartphones are making waves in the market right now. Can the Vivo V15 step out of the shadow of its Pro sibling and emerge as a truly capable smartphone in its price bracket? Can it justify its asking price of Rs. 23,990 and wow potential buyers? Let's find out in our in-depth review of the Vivo V15.    The Vivo V15 is ever so slightly larger than the Vivo V15 Pro, but has an identical design. At 161.97×75.93×8.54mm, it isn't the smallest device out there, and it tips the scales at 189.5g. It will require a bit of a stretch to reach touch controls at the top of the screen. Curved edges give this phone a comfortable in-hand feel, but the rear panel can get scuffed easily. Within a few days of usage, we noticed that the rear panel had small scratch marks at the bottom and edges. The finish is also quite glossy and picks up fingerprint marks and smudges easily. There are three colour options — Royal Blue, Frozen Black, and Glamour Red. We have the Glamour Red version for review and its gradient pattern shifts between a punchy shade of magenta and deep maroon, with sparkling silver dots at the bottom. The gradient finish extends all the way to the frame of this phone for a uniform look. The Frozen Black variant does not have this top-to-bottom colour shift effect. Were it not for their different colour schemes, it would be nigh impossible to discern the V15 from the V15 Pro. This similarity is not necessarily a bad thing, because the Vivo V15 inherits the solid build quality of its Pro sibling. Starting with its looks, the Vivo V15 flaunts a gradient finish on the rear panel — Spectrum Ripple Design, in the company's lingo. Though Vivo uses the same description for both models, but the gradient texture on the Vivo V15 lacks the wave-like micro-dot pattern that makes the Vivo V15 Pro stand out. As for build quality, the Vivo V15's rear panel is made out of polycarbonate and so is the curved strip frame running around the edges. The device feels solid, and we did not notice any flex when applying force to the rear panel. The Vivo V15 flaunts a gradient texture and comes in three colour options   The positioning of the fingerprint sensor is convenient. The huge camera bump is an eyesore as it stands out prominently. The pop-up module for the front camera is in line with the rear cameras, similar to how it's placed the Vivo V15 Pro. The motorised selfie camera module pops in and out smoothly within one second. It remains to be seen how the mechanism will hold up after extended use, so we would advise some caution while using it. The right side is where the power button and volume buttons are located. They're positioned conveniently and provide satisfactory tactile feedback, although the volume buttons are a little too stiff. A ‘Smart Button' is located on the left, and it can be customised to activate Google Assistant or trigger a Google search with a single press. Double-press and long-press actions trigger tasks such as launching the image recognition tool and opening the Google Assistant Visual Snapshot page. These shortcuts can be customised as per users' preference. Above it sits a tray for two Nano-SIM cards and a microSD card. Thankfully, it is not a hybrid tray, which means you won't have to sacrifice dual-SIM functionality in favour of more storage. The Micro-USB port, 3.5mm headphone jack, a microphone, and the speaker are positioned at the bottom. On the top is another microphone and the cutout for the pop-up camera module. The front is almost completely occupied by the 6.53-inch Ultra FullView In-cell full-HD+ (1080×2340 pixels) display. According to Vivo, this phone has a 90.95 percent screen-to-body ratio and is covered by Corning Gorilla Glass 5. Except for the chin at the bottom, bezels are pretty much non-existent, for a nearly all-screen design. The earpiece is centrally located at the top. Apart from a Vivo V15 unit, the box includes a Micro-USB cable, an 18W charger, a hard silicone case, a headset, a SIM ejector tool, and some paperwork. The Vivo V15 has an interesting mix of hardware. As mentioned above, it packs a 6.53-inch Ultra FullView In-Cell full-HD+display (1080×2340 pixels). We would have a liked a Super AMOLED panel like the one the Vivo V15 Pro has, especially considering that the Samsung Galaxy A50 (Review) and Galaxy A30 (Review) both have Super AMOLED panels despite being priced significantly lower. The Vivo V15 runs FunTouch OS 9 based on Android 9 Pie   The Vivo V15 is powered by the octa-core MediaTek Helio P70 SoC clocked at 2.1GHz, which has four ARM Cortex-A73 cores for all the heavy lifting and another four power-efficient Cortex-A53 cores. While this is a fairly capable processor, the Vivo V15's price tag warrants something beefier. For reference, the Realme 3 (Review) packs the same MediaTek Helio P70 processor but costs almost one-third of Vivo V15's asking price. Along with this SoC, you get 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, which can be expanded by up to 256GB using a microSD card. The Vivo V15 is available in a single configuration and is priced at Rs. 23,990. Aside from its eye-catching aesthetics, the main attraction of the Vivo V15 Pro is its imaging hardware, especially its 32-megapixel f/2.0 selfie shooter, which is the same as the Vivo V15 Pro's. The rear setup consists of a main 12-megapixel camera with a 1/2.8-inch sensor and f/1.78 aperture. It is accompanied by an 8-megapixel wide-angle camera with an f/2.2 aperture. It's described as having a 120-degree field of view, however, it actually captures 108-degree wide shots after factoring in lens distortion. There's also a 5-megapixel depth sensor with an f/2.4 aperture. For connectivity, you get 4G VoLTE, Bluetooth 4.2, a Micro-USB port with OTG support, GPS/ A-GPS, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The battery is a 4,000mAh unit and this phone supports Vivo's Dual-Engine Fast Charging. The use of a Micro-USB port on the Vivo V15 is surprising as well as disappointing, since even phones that are priced significantly lower have already embraced the USB Type-C standard. The Vivo V15 Pro's in-display fingerprint sensor does not make it to this more affordable model, and so there's a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor on the Vivo V15. On the software side, the Vivo V15 runs FunTouch OS 9 based on Android 9 Pie, and our review unit had the January security patch. There is a steep learning curve if you are coming from stock Android, especially when it comes to finding what you're looking for in the Settings app. There is no app drawer, so you have to swipe across your home screens to see all your apps. A swipe to the right on the first home screen will open the Smart Launcher where you can find task cards for the weather, a to-do list, app shortcuts, and news headlines. There's a universal search bar that can be used to find an app, jump to a system setting, or perform a quick Web search. The Vivo V15 comes with a ton of pre-installed apps, which include both in-house and third-party ones such as Gaana, Facebook, Paytm, Newspoint, UC Browser, and PhonePe. FunTouch OS 9 also has some neat features of its own. For example, the message screen splitting feature shows incoming message notifications as floating bubbles that you can tap to instantly open the message in a split-screen view for multitasking. The Vivo V15 comes equipped with a 32-megapixel pop-up selfie camera   There are a host of other nifty features such as Smart Lock, Smart Mirroring, and Smart Motion. FunTouch OS 9 also offers two power saving modes. The “Low Power Mode” optimises the CPU and GPU speeds, automatically lowers the screen brightness, disables Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and takes other such measures to reduce power usage. The “Extreme Power-Saving Mode” shuts down all activities and apps except Phone, Messages, Contacts, and Clock. You can read about FunTouch OS 9 in more detail in our Vivo V15 Pro review. Before we delve into the performance of the Vivo V15, let's talk about the display. Unlike the Super AMOLED panel on the Vivo V15 Pro, the Vivo V15 packs a 6.53-inch In-Cell LCD display, but resolution remains the same at 1080×2340 pixels. The colour output is good and text looks crisp on it. Viewing angles are also decent with minimal colour shift when seen from different angles. Thanks to the all-screen design of this phone, playing games and watching full-HD 60fps videos was enjoyable. The Vivo V15's default colour profile is slightly on the colder side, but you can tweak the colour temperature to your liking. There is also an option to adjust the colour tone in order to reduce eye fatigue, which can either be activated manually or scheduled. While the full-screen design looks good, the rounded corners tend to hide some screen content, especially in apps that do not support scaling. You can either live with it or disable full-screen scaling on a per-app basis, but doing so will add ugly black bars on each side while playing games and watching videos in landscape mode. The Vivo V15's display also could have been better in terms of brightness. Using the device indoors posed no issues, but sunlight legibility was not as good as we would expect. Videos and photos appeared dim, even with the brightness cranked all the way up to the 100 percent mark. Another disappointment is the lack of Widevine L1 certification, something that was also missing from the Vivo V15 Pro. This means you won't be able to stream HD videos on Netflix or Amazon. This is perplexing for a phone that costs over Rs. 20,000. The Vivo V15 can shoot slo-mo videos, but it is incapable of 4K video capture   We found the MediaTek Helio P70 to be a capable processor. In our day-day-to usage, we did not come across any shortcomings. The usual social media and productivity apps launched quickly, and switching between them was also buttery smooth. The 6GB of RAM certainly helps while running multiple apps in the background. Coming to the Vivo V15's performance in synthetic benchmarks, it scored 1,46,753 in AnTuTu. It also managed 1,511 and 5,767 points in Geekbench's single-core and multi-core tests respectively. As for more graphics-intensive tests, the latest Vivo smartphone managed 35fps in the GFXBench T-Rex test and put up 11fps in the GFXBench Manhattan 3.1 test. These scores are similar to those of the Oppo F11 Pro, which is not surprising as both smartphones are powered by the same processor and have equal amounts of RAM. However, gaming performance was as not as impressive. We tested the Vivo V15's gaming chops with PUBG Mobile, Asphalt 9: Legends, and Modern Combat 5. PUBG Mobile was set to the Medium preset by default, with the Medium frame rate and Balanced graphics. While the experience was mostly smooth, we did have to deal with sporadic lag and stutters. Asphalt 9: Legends ran without any issues, but amping up the visual quality to High resulted in a lot of frame drops and stutters. FunTouch OS 9 offers a feature called Game Cube which claims to enhance the in-game experience, but we did not see any noticeable gameplay improvements before or after adding a title to the Game Cube list. Another gaming-centric feature is Game Assistant, which claims to optimise the CPU and RAM for a better experience, and provides quick access buttons for blocking notifications and controlling call behaviour. There's an Esports Mode that lets users close background apps and block notifications while playing a game and disable touch gestures to prevent accidentally opening the notifications shade. There is also an option called “Smart temperature rising strategy”, which when activated, keeps performance steady even if it results in generating excess heat. One noticeable omission is the lack of face recognition. Both the Vivo V15 and the Vivo V15 Pro feature 32-megapixel selfie cameras housed in motorised pop-up modules, but the latter supports face recognition, while the former inexplicably misses out on it. A Vivo spokesperson confirmed to Gadgets 360 that the Vivo V15 does not support this a security feature, and there is no word on whether it can or will be enabled with a software update in the future. The fingerprint sensor, on the other hand, is impressively quick and unlocks the device in less than a second. As for camera performance, the Vivo V15 proved to be quite competent. The camera UI is virtually the same as on the Vivo V15 Pro. Shortcuts for the document scanning mode, Pro mode, AI beauty, and AR stickers are laid out at the bottom, while controls for wide-angle mode, scene selection, and portrait mode are neatly arranged above the shutter button. At the top, one can find the controls for the settings section, portrait lighting effects, live photos, and HDR mode. The 12-megapixel main camera employs a 1/1.28 inch sensor with 1.28-micron pixels and an aperture value of f/1.78. Vivo claims that the main camera has 24 million photosensitive units and employs Dual Pixel Focusing technology to deliver brighter photos with higher clarity. The images captured by the Vivo V15, indeed, turned out to be quite detailed, exhibiting punchy colours and commendable surface details. Image captured using Vivo V15's primary 12-megapixel rear camera (tap to see full-sized image)   Image captured using Vivo V15's wide-angle camera (tap to see full-sized image)   The Vivo V15 truly shines when it comes to macro shots. Subjects with rich colour profiles were captured with great detail. Shades turned out to be vibrant, gradients were decent, and surface traits such as ridges were also distinguishable when zoomed in. Even though close-up shots captured by the Redmi Note 7 Pro are better, the ones captured by the Vivo V15 can hold their own. Daylight shots also turned out to be crisp with good dynamic range and sharpness. There are a few shortcomings too. We noticed occasional colour bleeding along the edges in macro shots, especially if the object in focus was brightly coloured. Also, some daylight photos turned out to be a little muted and exhibited washed-out colours, especially those captured under harsh lighting. Users might particularly miss having a night mode. The shots we took in low light exhibited grainy textures and had a considerable amount of noise. HDR mode tries to make up for this with higher saturation and contrast, but it ends up softening details. In comparison, the Redmi Note 7 Pro (Review) did a much better job at retaining details and bringing out colours. As for portrait shots, they turned out well, with good depth. We quite liked the ability to adjust the strength of the blur effect both before and after taking a photo. The Vivo V15's cameras do a good job at locking focus and preserving detail, but edge detection could have been a tad better. We often found the extremities of an object in focus blurred mistakenly when the intensity of the effect was increased. The blur effect turned out to be particularly uneven with complex subjects such as vines. A dedicated wide-angle camera is certainly one clear advantage the Vivo V15 has, letting users capture wide panoramas. Thankfully, we did not see any barrel distortion like we did with some of the wide-angle shots captured by the V15 Pro. Instead, we found that objects look slightly flat, as if they are inclined inwards. This was only noticeable with objects that have a sharp outline. The video recording resolution maxes out at full-HD with the frame rate set to 30fps. It is a little disappointing that the Vivo V15 can't shoot 4K or full-HD 60fps video. Recordings turn out to be decent, but the lack of stabilisation on this phone means there is a lot of shaking and trembling in the videos. Slo-mo video recording is also on the table, with the resolution set to 1280 x 720 pixels at 30fps. The 32-megapixel front camera somewhat redeems the shortcomings of the rear cameras. Selfies captured by the front camera had an impressive amount of detail, with good colour reproduction and sharpness. Edge detection was also fairly accurate, and the studio lighting effects help make shots social-media-ready by letting you add filters and colourful effects.    Tap to see full-sized Vivo V15 camera samples   The AI Beauty mode offers a tonne of beautification options such as skin smoothening, skin lightening, jawline slimming, and eye enlargement. There are also full-body beautification tools that do things like reducing waistlines and making legs look thinner and longer. While the face beautification filters do their job as promised, they tend to change the colour profile of the whole image. For example, the skin lightening filter ups the ISO which affects the entire frame. Battery performance is one area where the Vivo V15 rises above its Pro sibling. The 4,000mAh battery easily lasted us through a day of demanding usage. During our regular usage — which involved being connected to a Wi-Fi network all day long, using social media and productivity apps, listening to music with wireless headphones for at least a couple of hours, around an hour of gaming, and a few calls — the Vivo V15 still had around a 30-35 percent charge left at the end of the day. In our HD video loop test, the Vivo V15 lasted for 15 hours and 22 minutes. As for endurance figures, a 30-minute session of PUBG Mobile at peak brightness led to a battery drop of 9 percent. Vivo ships the device with an 18W charger which takes the battery from 0 to 40 percent in 30 minutes, and up to 75 percent in just one hour. Charging this phone to full capacity took around 1 hour, 40 minutes. We noticed a reduction in the charging speed once the battery reaches the three-quarters mark. VerdictThe Vivo V15 impressed us with its long battery life, beautiful design, solid build quality, and a capable front camera. However, it has its fair share of shortcomings too. It is still stuck with a Micro-USB port, can't stream HD videos from services like Netflix, and its UI needs some refinement. Moreover, low-light photography is sub-par for a phone at this price. Unfortunately for Vivo, its competition has more to offer at significantly lower price points. The Redmi Note 7 Pro (Review) has a more powerful processor, better rear cameras, larger battery, USB Type-C port, impressive build quality, and more for Rs. 13,999. Even the Realme 3 (Review), starting at just Rs. 8,999, is powered by the same processor as the Vivo V15, and is a good budget offering. The Vivo V15 also faces stiff competition from the Samsung Galaxy A50 (Review) which flaunts an eye-catching design, a beautiful Super AMOLED display, triple rear cameras, and an in-display fingerprint sensor. Then there is the Oppo F11 Pro (Review), which offers similar specifications including a pop-up front camera, but better camera performance, for a slightly higher asking price. The Poco F1 (Review) and Asus ZenFone 5Z (Review) also offer flagship-level specifications at around the same price point. To round things up, the Vivo V15 has a few things going for it but it goes up against numerous competitors that offer more bang for the buck. Even if you really like the idea of a pop-up camera, you can get much better hardware and overall performance elsewhere."
2056,21,vivo-v5s-review-1691128,7,10,2017-05-09,1691128,Ketan Pratap,Vivo V5s Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/vivo-v5s-review-1691128," Smartphones targeted at selfie-obsessed users aren't a new thing anymore. Brands including Gionee, Oppo, and Vivo have consistently been launching selfie-focused smartphones in India, which sport front camera enhancements. However, it isn't enough to be good at just one thing. Vivo's V5 series has been fairly popular, and the company is extending the series further. The new Vivo V5s is the third smartphone in the range, following the more affordable Vivo V5 and the premium Vivo V5 Plus. The new Vivo V5s looks identical to the Vivo V5 Plus, which isn't bad considering that it sells for less. With a decent set of specifications and a 20-megapixel front camera, the Vivo V5s makes for a capable mid-range handset. But is that enough to make it the best selfie smartphone in its category? We try to find out.    Like we mentioned earlier, the new Vivo V5s closely follows the design cues of the Vivo V5 Plus (Review), and it actually looks quite impressive. The faux-metal finish at the back feels solid, though it isn't anywhere close to the metal of the V5 Plus. There are minor differences like the absence of dual front cameras on the V5s. The rear panel also sports iPhone 7-like antenna lines around the top and bottom edges instead of running across the back. The new Vivo V5s may be seen as an upgrade to the Vivo V5 (Review) in terms of specifications, and it definitely feels better in the hand, making it seem like a ""lite"" variant of the Vivo V5 Plus. At 7.55mm, the Vivo V5s isn't the slimmest phone in its price category, though the 154g weight is manageable. Despite featuring a 5.5-inch screen, the Vivo V5s never seemed hard to use with just one hand, and we noticed that our thumb was able to reach all four corners. The fingerprint scanner is placed on the front and is easy to reach. From the back, this phone looks an exact copy of the Vivo V5 Plus and it can be hard to distinguish the two when they are placed side-by-side. The front has no branding, but there's a Vivo logo in the middle of the back. The Vivo V5s has been launched in Matte Black and Crown Gold options. The physical buttons for power and volume are placed on the right, and we liked their tactile feel. The hybrid dual-SIM slot is located on the left. The bottom has a speaker grille, Micro-USB port, and 3.5mm audio socket. The Vivo V5s features a 5.5-inch HD (720x1280 pixels) IPS display with 2.5D curved-edge Gorilla Glass for protection, and a density of 267ppi. The screen is bright and text appears crisp. Sunlight legibility is decent and there is an eye protection mode to filter out blue light. The screen is good for watching videos and playing games, but we do think that a full-HD resolution would have been more appropriate. One of the biggest dealbreakers about this phone could be the HD screen resolution at this price. The Vivo V5s comes with the standard documentation, earphones, a Micro-USB cable, a power adaptor, a SIM ejector tool, and a transparent case. Additionally, there is a screen protector fitted on it out-of-the-box which some people might like and others might not. Overall, the Vivo V5s managed to impress us in terms of design though it can't match the solid feel of the Vivo V5 Plus.  Under the hood, the Vivo V5s is powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT6750 SoC coupled with 4GB of RAM. To recall, the Vivo V5 is powered the same processor. The V5s has 64GB of storage that's expandable using a microSD card (up to 256GB) in the hybrid dual-SIM slot. The highlight of the specifications is the 20-megapixel front-facing camera that packs Sony's IMX376 sensor and a 5P lens system with an f/2.0 aperture. The front camera also has a 'Moonlight Glow' front flash. There's a 13-megapixel rear camera with PDAF technology. The phone has a dedicated AK4375 audio DAC which improves sound quality, according to the company. Connectivity options on the Vivo V5s include 4G VoLTE, Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi ac, and GPS/ A-GPS. Sensors include an accelerometer, an ambient light sensor, a digital compass, a proximity sensor, and a virtual gyroscope. There is a non-removable 3000mAh battery. The phone runs on Funtouch OS 3.0 which is based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and we were slightly disappointed to see that Nougat isn't being offered. There's no confirmation of an update either. Several other smartphones at around this price level come running Android Nougat out-of-the-box, including the Moto G5 Plus, Tecno i7, and Gionee A1. This phone hasn't even received the Google Assistant feature which many other phones running Marshmallow have. The iOS-styled Funtouch OS takes a lot of inspirations from Apple. We get a quick settings panel that can be pulled up by swiping upwards on the screen. Swiping down opens up a toolbar for searching through apps, files, and folders stored on the device. The Vivo V5s runs the same version of Funtouch OS seen earlier on the Vivo V5 Plus, and there's no visual change in the interface. The app icons and the themes are heavily customised. There are some interesting touches software from Vivo in like the App Clone feature, which lets users create a second instance of any app. Notably, users can use the two app instances to log into different accounts., with Whatsapp, Line, BBM, WeChat, Zalo, and Viber currently supported. Vivo has tried integrating split-screen multitasking with what it calls Smart Split 2.0. The feature basically lets you run two apps simultaneously, and currently supports limited apps including Facebook, the default messages app, WeChat, Whatsapp, YouTube, VLC for Android devices, and MX player. During the review period, we found that this was easy to use. Some of the other software enhancements include a one-handed mode that shrinks the display to one corner of the screen for quick access; Smart Click, which allows turning on the flashlight or launching the camera by just long-pressing a volume button; and Smart Motion, which lets you activate a bunch of gestures to control various functions. As previously seen on the Vivo V5 and V5 Plus, the V5s also comes with tons of preloaded apps which cannot be deleted, including i Manager, i Music, V-Appstore, Vivo Cloud, and i Theme which were all were redundant for us. There are some third-party apps as well including WPS Office, UC Browser, and Amazon.  The Vivo V5s does a decent job when it comes to general operations like multitasking or running apps smoothly. We had no issues in switching from one app to another, and gaming performance was also impressive. Games like Asphalt 8, Subway Surfers, and Dead Trigger 2 ran smoothly. During our review, we found that 4GB RAM was sufficient for most tasks, and there was usually around 2.3GB of RAM free when the phone was idle. Unlike many phones at around the same price such as the Gionee A1, the Vivo V5s doesn't heat up much except while using the camera and when gaming for a long time. Our test videos played without any glitches, and sound quality from the speaker was impressive. Music played through the bundled earphones sounded quite good, but we wish that Vivo shipped in-ear earphones rather than the simple ones in the box, to take advantage of the DAC. In terms of benchmarks, AnTuTu and Quadrant returned scores of 49,912 and 28,109 respectively. Graphics scores were decent as well, with 21fps in GFXBench and 5,160 points in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme. The phone supports 4G on both SIMs though only one at a time. The Vivo V5s can work with VoLTE, and call quality is good. The multimedia experience is satisfactory though a full-HD resolution might have made it better. The Vivo V5s smartphone's biggest highlight is its 20-megapixel front camera, which fares well in all kinds of situations. Selfies taken in broad daylight or with sufficient light manage to show good amount of detail and proper colours. Ones taken in low light have noise at the corners but are still better than what we get from other phones in the same price segment which claim to offer an enhanced selfie camera. You can always touch up your shots with the Face Beauty Mode 6.0. There's a group selfie mode that lets you take panoramic shots. The 13-megapixel rear camera on the Vivo V5s impressed us as well. It's quick with focusing, and manages to capture some good detailed shots. We noticed slight distortion at the edges, which was disappointing. Keeping the HDR mode on prevents images from getting overexposed in harsh lighting conditions. Macro and landscape shots taken with the Vivo V5s are also decent. Tap to see full-sized Vivo V5s camera samples We liked the Vivo V5s camera interface which has all options just a tap away. The V5s can record videos at 1080p and the quality is good. Overall, the rear camera on the Vivo V5s manages to impress even considering that it isn't a feature that's being marketed by the company. The phone packs a non-removable 3000mAh battery which managed to run for 12 hours, 45 minutes in our HD video loop test, which is quite impressive for a battery of this size. In real-world usage, the phone manages to last over a day with heavy usage; with light usage could make it last a day and a half before you need to recharge. We found that the V5s took slightly less than 90 minutes to charge fully from zero, which isn't bad at all, considering fast charging support is not listed as one of the features. VerdictThe Vivo V5s can be seen as an improvement over the Vivo V5. The phone impressed us with its general performance, battery life, and camera quality. The HD display and the fact that it still runs the now-dated Android Marshmallow are our two main complaints. The excessive bloatware was also disappointing. Compared to the Oppo F3 and Gionee A1 (Review) - two of this phone's closest competitors - the Vivo V5s offers better selfies and is also more affordable at its price of Rs. 18,990. If you're not that obsessed with selfies, there are better all-rounders at this price or less."
2396,21,vivo-v9-pro-review-1941486,8,10,2018-11-02,1941486,Aditya Shenoy,Vivo V9 Pro Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/vivo-v9-pro-review-1941486," When the Vivo V9 was launched in India, it was the first Android device to sport a notch. It was powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 626 SoC and had 4GB of RAM, and we felt that it was relatively powerful when we reviewed it. Soon after, we saw far better phones being launched at around the Rs. 20,000 mark, which made the Vivo V9 look overpriced for what it had to offer. The Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review), for instance, offered a powerful Snapdragon 660 processor at just Rs. 16,999 and the Poco F1 (Review) was a powerhouse starting at Rs. 20,999. Vivo felt the heat and dropped the price of the Vivo V9 (Review) to stay relevant. Now, with even more competition in the market, Vivo has dropped the Vivo V9 Pro, which packs in better hardware and is still comparatively affordable at Rs. 17,990. Does the bump in hardware make it a better package? We take a look to find out.    The Vivo V9 Pro could pass off for the V9, because visually, these two are identical. It is slim and the curved sides make it easy to hold. Just like the V9, the Vivo V9 Pro has a notch at the top of the display which houses the earpiece, sensors, notification LED, and selfie camera. The notch is compact and liberates a lot of screen real estate on either side. The 6.3-inch display has thin bezels all around except the bottom where it is comparatively thicker. Vivo has managed to keep the weight under control, and the device weighs just 150g. At the bottom, it has a 3.5mm headphone jack, a Micro-USB port, and a loudspeaker grille. In the time that we spent with the Vivo V9 Pro, we weren't happy with the headphone jack placement as it would come in the way while playing games in landscape mode. The top of the phone is bare. Vivo has positioned the power and the volume buttons on the right of the device, and they are easy to reach. The left side of the device only has the SIM tray which has dual Nano-SIM slots and a dedicated microSD card slot. The 6.3-inch IPS display has thin bezels around the edges   The Vivo V9 Pro has a dual camera setup at the back along with a single-LED flash and a fingerprint scanner. While most other smartphones in this price range use premium materials in their construction, Vivo uses plastic. The V9 Pro is available in Black and Nebula Purple colour options, and we had the Black variant for review. To give it a rich look, the camera module rim, fingerprint scanner, and the Vivo logo have a golden highlight. The phone has a pre-applied screen protector and you get a transparent case in the box. Vivo also ships a 10W charger and a pair of earphones in the box. The main thing differentiating the V9 Pro from the non-Pro model is its octa-core Snapdragon 660 processor. Vivo has opted for a more powerful chip and has paired it with 6GB of RAM. You get 64GB of internal storage which is expandable by up to 256GB. The 6.3-inch IPS display has a full-HD+ resolution. It has good viewing angles and can get bright enough when outdoors. While the more powerful processor is an obvious upgrade, there are a few other changes. Vivo has opted for a 13-megapixel + 2-megapixel camera combination instead of the 16-megapixel + 5-megapixel shooters on the Vivo V9, which is a surprising reduction. Similarly, the selfie camera too has a 16-megapixel sensor instead of the 24-megapixel sensor on the V9. In terms of connectivity, there is support for Bluetooth 5.0, dual-band Wi-Fi, GPS, GLONASS, USB-OTG, and FM radio. There is support for 4G as well as VoLTE on both SIMs. The notch on the V9 Pro houses the earpiece, sensors and the selfie camera   Vivo ships the V9 Pro with Android 8.1 Oreo and its custom Funtouch OS 4 on top. Our review unit was running the September security patch which is fairly recent. Funtouch OS is designed to mimic iOS and uses similar icons to pull off that look. However, there is support for themes that let you completely change the way the UI looks. Vivo has also thrown in gesture navigation so you can swipe to navigate instead of using the three traditional Android UI buttons. A swipe up from the bottom of the screen gives you access to the Control Center which houses all the quick settings shortcuts. For notifications, you still need to swipe down from the top of the screen. Face Unlock uses the selfie camera to scan your face and unlock the smartphone. It is as quick as the fingerprint scanner if not quicker to unlock the smartphone. If you wish, you can also lock down apps and games using either the fingerprint scanner or Face Unlock. There are more customisations, such as Motorbike Mode which automatically rejects incoming calls and sends an SMS to the caller. The App Clone feature is similar to Dual Apps, letting you run two instances of supported apps. It also has a gaming mode which is similar to what we found on the Vivo V9, which you can read all about it in our Vivo V9 review. While there are a lot of features, you also get a fair amount of preinstalled bloatware. You'll find Vivo apps called V-Appstore, i Manager, Weather, and Easyshare, along with NewsPoint, UC Browser, WPS Office, Amazon, Facebook, PhonePe, and Google apps. We found NewsPoint to be a little spammy as it kept sending notifications. You can uninstall most of these apps to stop them from bothering you, and also reclaim some storage space. The Vivo V9 Pro packs in a powerful processor, and it is evident when you use the phone. There is no hint of lag or stutter when going through the menus or while multitasking. Large apps and games are quick to load and you can still multitask with them in the background thanks to the 6GB of RAM. We put the V9 Pro through our usual benchmark tests and it managed to score 129,190 in AnTuTu as well as 1448 and 5486 in Geekbench's single-core and multi-core tests respectively. Graphics benchmark performance was good, and the phone managed to score 41fps and 7.1fps in GFXBench's T-Rex and Car Chase tests respectively. It scored 1855 in 3DMark Slingshot and maxed out in Ice Storm Extreme. The dual camera setup on the Vivo V9 Pro   In our HD video loop battery test, the smartphone managed to go on for 10 hours and 8 minutes. The phone ran PUBG at medium settings and did not get hot when we were playing the game in an air-conditioned room. The battery drain was low while gaming, allowing us to play multiple rounds before needing to plug in the charger. With our usage consisting of an active WhatsApp account, about an hour and a half of navigation using Google Maps, 30 minutes of PUBG Mobile, and a few of our benchmark tests over the course of a day, the phone displayed the power saving pop-up at 9pm. With lighter usage you should be able to go beyond a day. The camera app is similar to what we have seen on other Vivo smartphones. You get toggles for HDR, Portrait, and Live Photo modes. You can switch to Panorama mode or a Professional mode that lets you control the exposure, ISO, shutter speed, white balance, and autofocus. Beautification is available for both the primary and the selfie camera. Tap to see full-sized Vivo V9 Pro camera samples   Vivo has dropped the resolution of the cameras on the V9 Pro, which looks like a move to offset the cost of the processor upgrade. Photos taken with the Vivo V9 Pro were a hit-and-miss. In daylight, it managed to set the exposure right and focus where we wanted it to. Photos appeared good as is, but zooming in revealed a loss in details. Macros had good detail but it did take time to focus where we wanted. While shooting portraits, we found edge detection to be unreliable. In some instances, the V9 Pro didn't blur the gap between a person's arm and body. Low-light camera performance was below average, and while this phone managed to keep noise under control, the output was quite grainy. The V9 Pro takes good selfies and uses a screen flash in unfavourable light. Portrait mode is also available for the selfie camera and has good edge detection. Video recording on the V9 Pro maxes out at 1080p for both the primary and the selfie camera. This is surprising considering that the V9 could record video at 4K. There is no video stabilisation which results in shaky footage. We found that beautification mode can be enabled while recording a video as well as on video calls in compatible apps. Other than the lack of 4K video recording, the drop in camera resolutions has not had a significant impact on the quality of photos and videos compared to the Vivo V9. VerdictVivo has priced the V9 Pro better than some of its other offerings, including the Vivo V9. The Vivo V9 Pro has a more powerful processor and more RAM compared to the previous model. Unfortunately, in order to keep costs low, it opted for different camera sensors, but thankfully this has not had much effect on photo quality. Priced at Rs. 17,990, the Vivo V9 Pro is actually less expensive than the Vivo V9 (Review), which is still listed at Rs. 18,990. That makes it easy to recommend the new model over the older one."
2261,21,vivo-v9-review-price-in-india-22990-specifications-design-notch-1829215,7,10,2018-04-03,1829215,Aditya Shenoy,Vivo V9 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/vivo-v9-review-price-in-india-22990-specifications-design-notch-1829215," There is no denying that some smartphone manufacturers like to take inspiration from Apple’s designs. In the past, we have seen dozens of phones designed to look like the iPhone. Now that Apple has made a big design change with the iPhone X (Review), it was only a matter of time before other manufacturers followed suit. Asus was the first one to showcase the Zenfone 5 (2018) and Zenfone 5Z with a design heavily inspired by the iPhone X. Vivo has also taken the same approach with the Vivo V9, and since Asus hasn't launched its offerings in India yet, Vivo V9 has become the first Android smartphone in the country to launch with a notch. The Vivo V9 is making headlines thanks to its thin screen bezel and the notch that sits right at the top. While the device looks pretty interesting, does it have the hardware to justify its Rs. 22,990 price tag? We put it to the test.    Looking at the tall and narrow display on the Vivo V9, you might assume that its aspect ratio is 18:9 like many others. However, power it on, and the notch at the top is revealed. The notch is a lot smaller (in width) than the one on the iPhone X, and houses an earpiece, a selfie camera, and the proximity and ambient light sensors. It also houses a tiny notification light in the centre, just above the earpiece. The notch is enveloped by the display on either side, which allows Vivo to claim that the screen measures 6.3 inches. The screen-to-body ratio is also said to be 90 percent. Pick the phone up and you will notice that it is quite light, weighing just 150g, primarily thanks to the use of plastic in its construction. While it doesn’t feel as premium as the similarly priced Moto X4 (Review), it doesn’t feel cheap either. The glossy rear panel is made of high-quality plastic and isn’t slippery. However, it picks up fingerprints quite easily and you will need to keep cleaning it to preserve the glossy finish. Vivo has provided a clear case in the box, which you can use to avoid this issue completely.    Vivo has placed the power and the volume buttons on the right, while the SIM tray sits on the left. The Vivo V9 has a Micro-USB port at the bottom along with the loudspeaker, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and a microphone. The top is completely blank. Considering the price of the V9, we would have preferred a USB Type-C port, which is now quite common even on lower-priced phones such as the Xiaomi Mi A1 (Review). Turn the phone around and you will see that it has two cameras positioned vertically, along with a single LED flash. The dual-camera module protrudes slightly but has a metal rim around it which keeps the lenses from getting scratched. Towards the centre of the phone's rear is a fingerprint reader, and a Vivo logo below it. We found that the fingerprint reader was placed a little to high for our liking. Other than that, the phone is comfortable to use, thanks to its rounded corners which don’t dig into your palms when holding it. While the Vivo V9 looks like a high-end smartphone, the internals powering it are modest. Vivo has gone with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 626 SoC which is an octa-core processor clocked at 2.2GHz. The phone has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. It is a dual-SIM device and has two Nano-SIM slots. Storage on the phone is expandable upto 256GB thanks to the dedicated microSD card slot. The Vivo V9 sports a 6.3-inch IPS screen with a resolution of 1080x2280 pixels with a 9:19 aspect ratio. It has decent viewing angles but we found that our unit's display had a reddish tinge. Sadly this phone doesn't have options to tweak the display output, and as a result, you will have to settle with what you see. There is no mention of any type of toughened glass, but Vivo does ship a pre-applied screen protector with the V9. In terms of connectivity, there is support for Bluetooth 4.2, dual-band WiFi, GPS, USB-OTG, and FM Radio. There is support for 4G and VoLTE, but only one SIM can access a 4G network at a time, while the other is restricted to 3G connectivity.    Vivo V9 ships with Android 8.1 Oreo and its custom Funtouch OS 4.0 UI on top. It comes with the February Android security patch, which is fairly recent. Funtouch doesn't implement Notification Dots or Smart Text Selection, but you do get the useful Picture in Picture mode. The company has used the display area around the notch quite well with the right side displaying the battery percentage and other system status icons such as Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and VoLTE. The area to the left of the notch shows the signal strength and the icons of apps with pending notifications. Since the notch is relatively less wide, more information can be displayed than on the iPhone X. Just like older versions of Funtouch OS, this one also looks similar to iOS. As a result, you have a Control Center when you swipe up from the bottom of the screen, and notifications are accessible when sliding down from the top. The on-screen navigation buttons at the bottom of the display can be customised.    Vivo has also gone a step further and enabled gesture-based navigation, à la the iPhone X. You can swipe up from the centre of the bottom to jump to the home screen, or swipe up and hold to show the app switcher. Vivo also gives you the option to hide the navigation buttons, truly mimicking the navigation style of the new iPhone. During our review period, we found that this device could execute these gestures without any hint of lag. Apart from this, Vivo has also rearranged the Settings app, and as a result, we had to spend some time looking for the settings we wanted. You can use the global search feature to find settings but a search function within the Settings app. Other features of the Vivo V9 include Face Unlock which uses the front-facing camera positioned in the notch to unlock the phone after a successful scan. You also have the option to unlock apps using face recognition or a fingerprint. There is a gaming mode which disables heads-up previews and rejects calls automatically, except those from whitelisted contacts which are answered automatically in hands-free mode while gaming. Vivo has also thrown in a Picture in Picture mode for gaming, which lets you run messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Line, and Facebook Messenger - among others - in a floating window. Gesture recognition lets you launch apps by drawing alphabets when the screen is off. Vivo has clubbed some of the other gesture features under a separate Settings tab called Smart Motion. Air Operation uses the proximity sensor to wake the phone up when you wave your hand over the display. If you haven’t set a screen lock, you can also wake the phone from standby using this Air Unlock method. Other gestures include double-tap to wake/ turn off the display, raise to wake, and Smart Stay to keep the display on when you are looking at it.    The Smart Call features let you answer a call by holding the phone close to your ear, or answer directly in hands-free mode by waving a hand over the phone. It also allows calls to be switched to hands-free mode when you move the phone away from your ear. Smart Low Volume automatically lowers the volume of an incoming call when the phone detects a face looking at the screen. One-handed mode shrinks the display, making it easy to use the phone with one hand. App Clone, a feature that lets you run two instances of the same app, is also available. Smart Click lets you toggle the flashlight by long-pressing the volume down button, when the screen is off. This option can be customised so you can set the button to launch any app. This phone is packed with features but that hasn't stopped Vivo when it comes to throwing in pre-installed apps as well. The Vivo V9 comes with Flipkart, Prime Video, UC Browser, Amazon, NewsPoint, WhatsApp, Facebook, and WPS Office preinstalled. Thankfully, you can uninstall all of them to reclaim storage, if you need to. The Vivo V9 runs without any lag or stutter. The UI isn’t very heavy, and with 4GB of RAM, the phone can handle multitasking easily. We put the V9 through our tests where it managed 90,565 in Antutu while scoring 930 and 4546 in Geekbench 4’s single- and multi-core tests respectively. Graphics performance is decent and the phone managed 21fps in GFXBench T-Rex and 6.1fps in GFXBench Manhattan 3.1. Vivo’s Face Unlock feature worked decently in well-lit conditions. However, in low light, the device would fail to recognise a face and ask for the PIN to unlock. Using the fingerprint sensor was quicker in such situations. Not many apps are optimised for the V9’s 19:9 aspect ratio. As a result, we found that the Vivo V9 runs apps letterboxed at either 18:9 or 16:9 based on what the app supports. The 3260mAh battery offers average battery life and we found that the phone needed to be plugged in by late evening. Our usage included WhatsApp, watching a couple of videos on YouTube, and playing PUBG Mobile as well as Space Frontier. If your usage is less demainding, then you might be able to stretch it until the end of the day. You can also enable power saving modes to help you sail through. In our HD video loop test, the Vivo V9 could only manage 8 hours and 49 minutes of continuous playback which is a lot lower than average. The dual camera module on the Vivo V9 consists of a 16-megapixel primary sensor and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. Vivo hasn’t made significant changes to the camera app compared to its previous phones but has added AR stickers to keep up with the times. The V9 has an AI-powered beautify mode which Vivo claims can detect age, gender, texture, skin tone, and lighting conditions, and use that information to enhance the output. This functionality is also available for video calls when using WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and a few other apps. The default photo includes toggles for portrait mode and live photo mode. You can switch to panorama mode or a professional mode that lets you control the exposure, ISO, shutter speed, white balance, and autofocus. Vivo has also added a shot refocus feature that lets you shift focus after taking a shot. Photos taken with the Vivo V9 were a mixed bag. We found that the phone could deliver decent output in good light but the quality would suffer when conditions weren’t favourable. In daylight, the V9 was quick to focus and got the exposure right most of the time. However, the output was slightly grainy and landscape shots lacked detail. Macros turned out better as the phone could distinguish between the subject and the background. Low light is where the camera quality dropped. It took longer to lock focus and save images, resulting in blurry shots on a few occasions. If a scene has decent lighting, you might be able to get a clear image, but in low light, the Vivo V9 camera fails to capture details accurately. Tap to see full-sized Vivo V9 camera samples   The Vivo V9 sports a 24-megapixel selfie camera with an AI-assisted beautify mode. It does enhance shots automatically but you also have the option to manually set the level of beautification. Selfies have good amounts of detail and are good enough to go on social media sites. Video recording on the V9 maxes out at 4K and you can also record in 1080p and 720p resolutions. However, this phone lacks OIS (Optical Image Stabilisation) and EIS (Electronic Image Stabilisation), causing footage to be shaky. Vivo V9 in pictures   VerdictWith the V9, Vivo has managed to ship the first Android phone with a notch in India - for whatever that's worth. It has decent hardware, and the software has lots of customisations. The display helps it stand out from the rest, and those wanting to show off a phone with a notch now have this option at a price that's certainly a lot more affordable than the iPhone X. Face recognition works most of the time but the usage experience isn't as smooth as the rest of this phone's UI. At Rs 22,990, the Vivo V9 misses out on things like a USB Type-C port which has now become common. Battery life is weak, and if you are a heavy user, you will need to find a power outlet by the evening. Camera performance is decent in daylight but suffers in low light. If you are looking for an Android smartphone with a notch, the V9 only has the newly launched Oppo F7 as competition at the moment, but the category is expected to see a lot more launches. As for the V9, its big display, thin borders and small notch help it grab attention. However, if you aren’t interested in looks but are looking for more bang for the buck, the 6GB RAM variant of the Moto X4 might suit you better, or you can look at other top-rated phones in this price bracket. Do Oppo F7 and Vivo V9 show what to expect from OnePlus 6?

2269,21,vivo-x21-review-1861155,8,10,2018-06-05,1861155,Aditya Shenoy,Vivo X21 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/vivo-x21-review-1861155," Smartphones are evolving at a rapid pace and we now have better processors, cameras, and construction materials being used at every price level. Recently, we have also seen a lot of innovation when it comes to device security. Apple introduced FaceID last year with the iPhone X (Review) which replaced a fingerprint sensor with a TrueDepth camera. FaceID involves an infrared camera and a flood illuminator to accurately scan multiple points on the user's face in order to authenticate him or her. Another change that helps with smartphone design is the use of in-display fingerprint sensors. Vivo has already showcased this on its X20 Plus UD, as well as a concept phone called the Vivo Apex. The company has now launched the Vivo X21 in India, making it the first phone with an in-display fingerprint scanner in this country. Priced at Rs 35,990, does the Vivo X21 make a good case for this evolution in fingerprint recognition technology? We put it to the test.    Vivo was the first manufacturer to launch an Android smartphone with a screen notch in India, and unsurprisingly, the X21 also has a notch. In fact, it does look a lot like the last Vivo phone we reviewed, the Vivo V9. The X21 has a big 6.28-inch display at the front with thin borders all around except at the bottom where it is comparatively thicker. The notch houses a metallic earpiece, the selfie camera, and an IR sensor, among other things. At the back, the Vivo X21 has a dual camera setup along with a single-LED flash. It does not have a physical fingerprint sensor in the way that we are now used to. Vivo has managed to integrate it into the display on the front, and we'll have more on that later. Pick the phone up and you will notice that its frame is made out of metal when it gets cold in air-conditioned rooms. The back is made of glass and does not pick up fingerprints. However, it can be a little slippery. Vivo ships a case in the box that might come in handy to keep the X21 safe. All the buttons are placed on the right and you might need to shuffle your hand a bit to reach all of them. The left side of the phone is bare, while the top has the 3.5mm audio socket and a secondary microphone. At the bottom, there's a Micro-USB port, a SIM tray, and a speaker grille. It is shocking to see a Micro-USB port on the phone at this point, considering its price tag. All other models in this price range currently use the Type-C port standard. The in-display fingerprint scanner is being positioned as futuristic, but the Micro-USB port drags the Vivo X21 back into the past.    Vivo ships this phone with an 18W fast charger as well as XE710 headphones in the box. The X21 comes with a pre-applied screen protector, and Vivo warns against using aftermarket ones, because it could affect the in-display fingerprint scanner's performance. The Vivo X21 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 mobile platform and is clocked at 2.2GHz. It is an octa-core processor with eight Kryo 260 CPU cores and an Adreno 512 GPU. The X21 has 6GB of RAM and 128GB of internal storage. It is a dual-SIM smartphone with a hybrid slot letting you use a microSD card to expand storage by up to 256GB instead of a second SIM. One of the best things about the Vivo X21 is its AMOLED display. It has good viewing angles and punchy colours. The 6.28-inch display has a resolution of 1080x2280 pixels and a 19:9 aspect ratio. If you prefer neutral colour output, you might be disappointed that there is no way to tweak the display calibration. The dual camera setup at the back consists of a 12-megapixel primary sensor and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. The 12-megapixel Samsung sensor that Vivo has opted for uses dual-pixel technology and takes advantage of PDAF. The company has also opted for the same 12-megapixel sensor for the front camera, which undertakes face recognition duties as well as taking selfies. The highlight of the X21 is its in-display fingerprint sensor. This is a spot on the screen, positioned a little above where the on-screen home button. You will see a fingerprint icon in that spot, showing you where you need to place your finger. The icon glows brighter as you press down, allowing a CMOS sensor to get a good image of it. The placement is convenient and you'll get used to it in no time. The setup process is similar to what we've seen on smartphones before, but it takes slightly longer.    Unlocking the phone using the in-display fingerprint scanner is easy, but also takes longer than we're used to. Place your enrolled finger on the fingerprint icon and wait for it to light up as the scan is being processed. If your fingerprint isn't recognised, the phone will suggest that you press down harder. There are animations which look cool and you have can choose any of three different options, but you cannot turn them off. They might distract you from realising that it's taking longer than usual to recognise your fingerprint. The delay is unfortunate, but it isn't bad for what's essentially a first-generation product. You also get the option to enable face recognition, dubbed Face Access by Vivo. You can set up both the fingerprint scanner and face recognition to unlock the phone. We had multiple instances when the device recognised our face and unlocked itself before we had even placed our finger on the screen for a scan. The X21 runs Vivo's custom Funtouch OS. We found that it was running Funtouch OS 4.0 on top of Android Oreo, just like the Vivo V9. The display area around the notch is used for status icons, and surprisingly we could not find a setting to hide the notch off like we have seen on most other such phones recently.    Funtouch OS looks a lot like iOS and also has a Control Centre for all the quick toggles that are usually found in the notifications shade. You need to swipe up from the bottom of the display to access the Control Centre. Vivo has ditched a few Android Oreo features such as notification dots, and opted for custom app badges instead. Unfortunately, you miss out on the quick actions feature that stock Android Oreo offers. You can change the order of the on-screen navigation buttons or ditch them altogether and switch to gesture-based navigation. We did this while reviewing the X21 and found that the gestures were quite smooth and easy to get used to. Gesture shortcuts let you launch apps by tracing alphabets on the screen when it is off. There are a lot more gestures that you can enable if you like. The Vivo X21 isn't free form bloatware and you have apps like V-Appstore (an app store managed by Vivo), WPS Office, UC Browser, NewsPoint, PhonePe, Facebook, and WhatsApp among others. Other than Vivo's App Store, you can go ahead and uninstall all of them. The Vivo X21 is also on the list of devices that are eligible for Google’s Android P Beta build. While it is not certain that this phone will be updated to Android P when it is released, it does suggest a better chance of that happening. In our time with the Vivo X21, we did not find any lag or stutter. The Snapdragon 660 SoC is capable of delivering a smooth experience. With 6GB of RAM, this smartphone is capable of multitasking without any issues. We put the X21 through benchmark tests and found that it scored 142,969 in AnTuT 7, as well as 1577 and 5791 in Geekbench4's single-core and multi-core tests respectively. It also clocked 35fps in GFXBench T-Rex, and 13fps in GFXBench Manhattan 3.1. It scored 26,271 in 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited, but failed to run the Slingshot and Slingshot Extreme benchmarks. Like most other phones with 19:9 displays, the Vivo X21 runs compatible apps fullscreen. Those that are not fully compatible either run in the 18:9 aspect ratio or the more traditional 16:9. Vivo hasn't made significant changes to the camera app, and you have the usual camera modes to choose from while shooting, including face beauty, panorama, and pro modes. AR stickers are available, and Vivo says that the camera is AI-powered so that it can detect gender, age, skin colour, and skin tone. When shooting in Auto mode you get quick toggles for portrait mode, live photo, and HDR. The professional mode lets you set the exposure, ISO, shutter speed, white balance, and autofocus. Tap to see full-sized Vivo X21 camera samples   Photos taken with the X21 turned out quite well and we were happy with the output. The Vivo X21 is super-quick to focus and set the right exposure when shooting in Auto mode. Landscape shots turned out quite well and the phone was also quick to enable HDR mode automatically when required. The phone does a good job of separating the subject from the background in macro shots. We tried shooting in Bokeh mode, which lets you simulate a lower aperture. We found that the edge detection was decent but we did see edges getting blurred occasionally. Low light shots were average, and the X21 missed some detail in objects at a distance. If you are taking photos with a light source nearby, you will be able to get better quality. Selfies turned out a little overexposed but we liked them. You can set different levels of beautification before taking a selfie, or set the control to auto and let the phone decide. Video recording maxes out at 4K for the primary camera and the selfie camera. There did not seem to be any time restriction on 4K video recording, and we went beyond 10 minutes in our tests. We found that colours appeared oversaturated in 4K videos, and there is no form of stabilisation beyond 1080p. The Vivo X21 has a 3200mAh battery, and offers good runtime, plus low power drain when at idle. In our HD video loop test, the smartphone managed to clock 14 hours and 11 minutes. With our usage, which included using WhatsApp, watching videos on YouTube, and playing games such as Clash Royale and Breakneck, the phone lasted for one full day and still had some juice left. The included fast charger is capable of charging the phone up to 50 percent in half an hour, but it takes close to an hour and a half to charge the device completely. Vivo X21 in pictures   VerdictThe Vivo X21 is the first smartphone with an in-display fingerprint scanner to launch in India. It has decent hardware coupled with Vivo's software, which you might or might not like. The in-display fingerprint scanner works well but isn't in the same league as the physical ones we now have on most smartphones. It is slightly slower to unlock the phone, but not painfully so. This is acceptable considering that the X21 is a first-generation product. On the other hand, opting for a Micro-USB port instead of USB Type-C on a phone priced at Rs 35,990 is a strange move. Vivo has priced this smartphone in the same league as the OnePlus 6 (Review), even though it isn't as powerful by a long shot. The Nokia 7 Plus (Review) costs a cool Rs 10,000 less and delivers roughly the same level of performance. You can opt for the Vivo X21 if you want to show off the new in-display fingerprint scanning technology. Most people would pick the OnePlus 6 at this price, but you could go with the Vivo X21 if you want to try out (or flaunt) the new in-display fingerprint scanning technology.  Is the Vivo X21 the future of smartphones or an overpriced gimmick?

2405,21,xiaomi-mi-a2-review-camera-performance-benchmark-battery-life-india-price-specifications-1897219,8,10,2018-08-10,1897219,Aditya Shenoy,Xiaomi Mi A2 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/xiaomi-mi-a2-review-camera-performance-benchmark-battery-life-india-price-specifications-1897219," Xiaomi has launched the Mi A2 as its second Android One phone in India. Google originally started the Android One programme to deliver the stock Android experience on entry-level handsets in developing markets. However, there were no new products in India after the initial launches from Karbonn, Micromax and Spice. Google later revived Android One in 2017 to offer users smartphones running stock Android without any manufacturer customisations. The first of these in India was the Xiaomi Mi A1 (Review) which launched last year. More manufacturers have enrolled into the program since then, but very few devices have made it to India. Nokia, an HMD Global brand, was the first to announce that its entire Android lineup would adopt Android One and all the smartphones that it announced at MWC 2018 have now launched in India. The new Mi A2 promises better hardware while still running bone-stock Android. So should the Xiaomi Mi A2 be the first choice for an Android purist on a budget? We put it to the test.    The Mi A2 is a well-designed smartphone. It has a metal unibody that gives it a premium feel in the hand. The first change you will notice compared to the Mi A1 is that it has a big 5.99-inch display with an 18:9 aspect ratio, which makes the phone tall and narrow. The sides are curved which makes it comfortable in the hand. Our Black review unit had a matte finish which resisted fingerprints to some extent. This phone is quite slippery and we would recommend that you put the case supplied in the box to use. The power and volume buttons are on the right and offer good feedback when pressed. We found that the power button is well placed, but the volume buttons are a little too high for our liking. Xiaomi has positioned the selfie camera, earpiece, selfie light and a notification light above the display while the space below it is blank. For those curious, this smartphone has a single-colour notification LED. The USB Type-C port at the bottom has speaker grilles on either side but only the right one houses a loudspeaker. An IR emitter that can be used to control IR-based appliance is at the top along with the secondary microphone. There is no 3.5mm headphone jack so you get a USB Type-C dongle in the box. Xiaomi claims that it has used a high-quality amplifier to improve audio output from the speaker and headphones.    Xiaomi has opted for a dual camera setup at the back, which is now positioned vertically compared to the horizontal setup on the Mi A1. There’s a 12-megapixel primary camera, a 20-megapixel secondary sensor, and an LED flash. This camera module protrudes quite a bit causing the Mi A2 to rock when placed on a flat surface. The fingerprint scanner is next to the camera module, at the natural resting position of either index finger. Xiaomi has opted for a 3000mAh battery to power the Mi A2. The Chinese smartphone maker has chosen the Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor to power the Mi A2. It has eight Kryo 260 CPU cores and an Adreno 512 GPU. The A2 has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. Sadly storage isn’t expandable unlike the Mi A1, and you will need to make do with the storage you get. This is a dual-SIM smartphone and has two Nano-SIM slots. There is support for 4G and VoLTE on both SIMs. The 5.99-inch display sports a full-HD+ resolution, has a pixel density of 403ppi, and uses Corning Gorilla Glass 5 for protection. Viewing angles are decent but the display does not get very bright. You don’t get the option to tweak the output. The Ambient Display feature wakes the phone when you get a notification. At 3000mAh, the battery capacity is lower than what most other smartphones in this segment offer. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 (Review) for example packs in a bigger 4000mAh battery. The Mi A2 supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 4+ but you only get a standard 10W charger in the box. Connectivity options on the Mi A2 include Bluetooth 5.0, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, GPS, A-GPS, GLONASS, and Beidou.    Xiaomi has focused on the cameras of the Mi A2. The 12-megapixel primary rear camera has 1.25-micron pixels and an f/1.75 aperture. The secondary 20-megapixel camera uses 4-in-1 pixel binning with bigger 2-micron pixels and an f/1.75 aperture. Unlike the Mi A1 which had zoom lens for 2X optical zoom with the secondary camera, the one on the Mi A2 should help in low light instead. The Xiaomi Mi A2 runs stock Android 8.1 Oreo, and Xiaomi has added its Feedback, File Manager, and Mi Drop apps on top. While the Feedback app cannot be disabled or uninstalled, you can go ahead and uninstall the other two. The camera app has also been customised by Xiaomi and is different from the default Android app - more on that in a bit. Of course, this phone also has gets Google apps preinstalled. When we started reviewing the phone it was running the June security patch but we got a software update during the course of the review bringing us up to date with the August security patch. If you are an Android purist, you will like the software experience on the Mi A2. It has an app drawer, and you need to swipe up to see all your installed apps. You also get Google Feed by swiping right from the homescreen and summon the Google Assistant by long-pressing the home button. We found that the phone lacks an app to let you use the IR emitter, which means that you cannot start controlling appliances right out of the box. You can download the Mi Remote app from the Play Store, but Xiaomi told Gadgets 360 that it will be rolling out an update after which the app will be preinstalled. The only gesture the Mi A2 supports is that double-clicking the power button will immediately launch the camera app. We have used the Nokia 7 Plus (Review), which has the same processor as the Xiaomi Mi A2, and was also running stock Android. The Xiaomi Mi A2 offers similar performance and we found no lag or stutter when flipping through the phone’s UI and multitasking. With 4GB of RAM, you should be able to multitask easily without the phone automatically killing apps in the background. The fingerprint scanner is quite fast and was quick to unlock the phone. The Xiaomi Mi A2 scored 1,33,467 in AnTuTu, and 1,645 and 4,840 in Geekbench 4’s single-core and multi-core tests respectively. These scores are slightly lower on average than those of the Nokia 7 Plus, which managed 1,37,573, 1,590 and 5,780 respectively. The Mi A2 also got 24,850 in 3DMark Slingshot Unlimited and 14fps in GFXBench Manhattan 3.1.    We played games such as PUBG, Clash Royale, and Asphalt 9. PUBG ran at medium settings by default and we did not have any issues with performance. We played the game for 25 minutes, surviving an entire round, and found that the phone did get warm to the touch without getting uncomfortably hot. Asphalt 9 ran at the default settings without any hiccups either. In our HD video loop test, the smartphone ran for 8 hours and 13 minutes, which is below average. We have seen the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review) and the Redmi Note 5 last for close to 16 hours thanks to their bigger batteries. With our usage comprising of active WhatsApp and Gmail accounts, an hour worth of games, some time with Instagram, and making a few calls, the battery saver mode kicked in after 7 and 30 minutes. If your usage is similar, you will need to keep the charger handy. The supplied charger takes close to 2 hours to charge the Mi A2 completely but so should invest in a Qualcomm Quick Charge certified charger to speed that up. Xiaomi has worked on its camera app and it is different from the stock Android camera. You get Short Video, Portrait, Square, Panorama, and a Manual mode, apart from the usual Photo and Video modes. The Manual mode lets you set white balance, focus, shutter speed and ISO, and also lets you choose between the ‘regular’ and ‘low light’ lenses. Xiaomi claims that it has tweaked the Portrait mode such that it uses the 12-megapixel camera in favourable light conditions but switches to the 20-megapixel camera in low light, but we found that this did not actually happen. While one lens is in use, the other acts as a depth sensor.  The Mi A2 is fairly quick to meter light and lock focus. Photos taken with the Mi A2 outdoors have a good amount of detail and colours are quite accurate. Zoom into an image and you can still see details without much loss. We noticed that the camera app also switched HDR on automatically when the scene required it, bringing out more details from the shadows and delivering slightly sharper results. Autofocusing is quick when taking macros and we found that the Mi A2 could focus on relatively small objects. Macros were sharp and the phone managed good separation between the subject and the background. In low light, the Mi A2 bumps the ISO up and lowers the shutter speed to help the primary camera capture more light, instead of switching to the secondary one. Xiaomi should have taken advantage of the better sensor for low-light shots by switching automatically, but you can do this yourself in Manual mode. These photos also have decent amounts of detail but we noticed aggressive noise reduction being applied in darker areas, leading to a watercolour effect when zooming in. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Mi A2 camera samples   Selfies are detailed and we got sharp results when shooting indoors. The selfie fill light comes in handy when shooting in low-lit conditions. HDR is available for the selfie camera and kicks in automatically when required. You can also select the level of beautification you need, and an Advanced mode which lets you tweak different beautification parameters. Video recording on the Xiaomi Mi A2 maxes out at 4K for the primary camera and 1080p for the selfie camera. You also get the option to shoot in 1080p at 60fps rather than 30fps with the rear camera, but we found that it had difficulty locking focus at the higher frame rate. Video stabilisation is available for the rear camera, and helps you capture steady footage. Xiaomi Mi A2 in pictures   VerdictThe Xiaomi Mi A1 (Review) was an obvious choice for anyone looking for stock Android on a budget. Things however have changed, with HMD Global bringing in Nokia handsets that run pure stock Android as well. Xiaomi will have to compete on pricing, and that’s exactly what it has done with this launch. The Xiaomi Mi A2 gets the cameras right and is amongst the best camera phones at this price point. Also, the powerful Snapdragon 660 processor has so far been restricted to more expensive phones, making this phone a tempting option for someone looking for a performer on a budget. Xiaomi has priced the Mi A2 at Rs. 16,999 which is quite aggressive for the hardware it offers. However, there are a few chinks in the Mi A2’s armour. Its battery capacity is below average, resulting in relatively poor battery life. Xiaomi has also ditched the 3.5mm headphone jack and there’s no microSD card slot, which are both things that buyers look for. If you can't do without stock Android and want good cameras without paying too much, then the Mi A2 should check all your boxes. If you're okay with MIUI, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review) is still a good alternative at a slightly lower price. You might also want to keep an eye on the upcoming Honor Play.

2415,21,xiaomi-redmi-6-pro-review-1920819,7,10,2018-09-25,1920819,Roydon Cerejo,Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-6-pro-review-1920819," The budget segment is usually where smartphone companies move the most volume, and in order to maintain its dominance, Xiaomi recently launched not one but three new budget Redmi smartphones. Today, we’ll be checking out the Redmi 6 Pro, which is supposed to be the most powerful in the new Redmi 6 series, and is the first Redmi phone outside the Redmi Note series to sport the ‘Pro’ moniker. Usually, Xiaomi uses this designation to indicate powerful hardware, and while the Redmi 6 Pro does have the strongest SoC of the new trio, the main differentiating factor for this model seems to be its notched display. This is also a first for a Redmi phone. Other than that, the Redmi 6 Pro seems to share most of its core specifications with existing Xiaomi models such as the Redmi Y2 (Review) and even the Redmi Note 5 (Review), which makes us wonder - other than the notch, does the Redmi 6 Pro bring anything drastically new to the table? We're about to find out.    Being the most premium phone of the new Redmi 6 family, the Redmi 6 Pro has been given somewhat better materials, in the form of a metal backplate. However, the overall design isn’t too different from what we’ve already seen from Xiaomi at around this price point. This is a fairly thick phone, and it's a bit hefty too, but it’s manageable. The buttons have good feedback without being noisy, and on the left side, you get a single tray which can hold two SIM cards and a separate microSD card. Something worth noting is that the Redmi 6 Pro does not support dual 4G VoLTE, which means that only one SIM can connect to a 4G network at a time. The placement of ports is good. The mono speaker is on the bottom right, so chances of blocking it when using the phone in landscape mode are slim. The headphone socket is placed on the top, and you also get an infrared (IR) emitter which can be used to control IR appliances through the Mi Remote app. The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro has a metal backplate and dual rear cameras   Our test unit is the black variant, which has a matte finish so it doesn’t pick up smudges very easily. You can also buy the Redmi 6 Pro in blue, red, or gold. The fingerprint sensor is easy to reach and is responsive. There’s a vertically stacked dual camera setup at the back, which protrudes only slightly, so it’s not much of an inconvenience. The main highlight of the Redmi 6 Pro is of course its 5.84-inch full-HD+ display. The contrast and brightness are adequate. Xiaomi tells Gadgets 360 that the display has a layer of toughened glass, although the company wouldn’t specify the vendor. The notch results in a bit more display area, but it's pretty massive. The other borders around the panel are also still very thick, including a fat chin at the bottom. This is one of the least attractive notch designs we've come across. Also, Xiaomi has for some reason found a really awkward spot for the notification LED - the bottom left portion of the chin - despite there seemingly being plenty of free space in the notch. In the box, the Redmi 6 Pro ships with a clear case, a SIM eject tool, a USB cable, and a 10W power adapter. The phone uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 625 SoC, which is a couple of years old now but is still a capable chip for general tasks. Gaming performance isn’t great, as some popular games like PUBG default to the lowest graphics settings, and even then, gameplay isn’t smooth. Our unit was running on a pre-release version of its MIUI software, which prevented us from running most benchmarks. Xiaomi did confirm with us that other than this, the software is identical to what retail units will ship with. AnTuTu managed to run, and it returned a decent score of 79,025 points. The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is available in two variants — one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and the other with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, which is the one we’re testing. The phone supports Bluetooth 4.2, dual-band 802.11 Wi-Fi a/b/g/n, GPS, USB-OTG, and GLONASS. It also has a gyroscope, ambient light sensor, compass, and an accelerometer. There’s FM radio too, but NFC is not present. MIUI offers plenty of gestures and customisation options   Our unit was running on MIUI 9.6, which is based on Android 8.1 Oreo. It had the slightly old July security patch. The Redmi 6 series will be updated to MIUI 10 soon, according to Xiaomi. MIUI offers gestures and customisable functions that are similar to what we’ve seen before. The leftmost home screen gives you a card-style layout for app shortcuts, stock prices, calendar events, etc. The Mi Store app gives you a curated list of apps and games from the Play Store, but it also sends annoying spammy notifications now and then, which we couldn’t disable. The same goes for the Mi Community app, but at least this can be uninstalled. The phone comes with several preinstalled apps for social networking, banking, video streaming, and browsing the Web. For navigating Android, you can either stick with the default three-button system, or switch to gestures. These work quite well, and we ended up using them a lot, but we did face one issue. The ‘Back’ gesture requires a swipe inwards from the left or right edges of the display. This means that when you try to access the menus in apps like Slack with the same gesture, you end up closing the app or going a step back unintentionally. Although Xiaomi has provided the option to mask the notch, MIUI doesn’t always scale well to the reduced aspect ratio. We saw portions of some menu buttons and even content in some apps getting cut off due to the masking. Face recognition is supported, and it works well under most lighting conditions, except in a pitch darkness. The Redmi 6 Pro is not particularly slim, but it's easy to handle   The Redmi 6 Pro works well with casual usage. The interface feels fluid, face recognition is quick, and it doesn’t heat up. Simpler games such as Alto’s Odyssey ran well, but more graphically demanding ones like Breakneck and even PUBG had to be played at medium to low settings. Despite having 4GB of RAM, we did notice that load times in games were a bit long, and multitasking between apps wasn't always stutter-free. We found that colours were vivid and punchy on the Redmi 6 Pro's screen, which makes this a good device for watching videos. Audio performance is good when using headphones but the speaker doesn’t get too loud for media playback. The stock music player has Hungama Music integration, and lets you stream audio tracks. The default video player, on the other hand, curates trending music videos (mostly Bollywood ones) from YouTube in addition to showing you your local files. The rear 12-megapixel camera has an f/2.2 aperture with PDAF. Autofocus was decently quick in good light. There’s auto-HDR , which did a good job of balancing the exposure in our experience. We observed good detail in landscape shots in daylight, and colours were pleasing too. The main sensor stumbled a bit with macros, as it simply wasn't able to resolve finer detail. The white balance was a bit of a hit or a miss in close-ups, and we often found ourselves having to tap-to-focus to get the white balance back on track. Saving HDR images takes a good couple of seconds in daylight. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro camera samples   In low light, autofocus speed dropped quite a bit, and it took longer to save regular images as well. It’s best to leave HDR off, as the time taken to save images increases even more, which makes it even more challenging to get blur-free shots at night. Details were quite mushy due to the noise reduction process, and colours were a bit dull. The camera app is simple and easy to use, with all the shooting modes just a swipe away. Portrait mode takes advantage of the secondary 5-megapixel camera on the back. However, edge detection was quite average, and we couldn't adjust the level of blur before or after taking a shot. The 5-megapixel front camera took okay selfies under good light, but due to the lack of screen flash, low-light images turned out grainy. Video performance was quite decent, and stabilisation worked well, with no visible jelly effect around the edges of the frame. The maximum resolution you can shoot at is 1080p. Battery life is one of the strong suits of the Redmi 6 Pro. The 4000mAh battery easily lasted us a full day and a bit more on one charge. Playing heavy games didn't drain the battery too much either. In a single round of PUBG (around 30 minutes), in which we survived till the very end, we recorded a drop of around seven percent, which is not bad. In our internal video loop test, we got a runtime of 16 hours and 45 minutes, which is very good. The Redmi 6 Pro doesn’t support fast charging, but the bundled 10W adapter gave us roughly a 55 percent charge in an hour, and it took us roughly 2 hours and 35 minutes to charge it completely from zero. VerdictLooking at Xiaomi’s current Redmi lineup, the Redmi 6 Pro doesn’t make a very strong case for itself. There’s nothing terribly wrong with it, but at the same time, it doesn’t really offer anything new or different compared to the existing Redmi Note 5 (Review), which costs Rs. 1,000 less for the same amount of RAM and storage. You also have the Redmi Y2 (Review) at the exact same price as the Redmi 6 Pro, and that model has a better front camera, but you'd compromise a bit on the display and battery capacity. What Xiaomi has essentially done here is create a bit of confusion in its own lineup. However, notches seem to be in demand these days, so we can see buyers considering this option for that reason alone. If you’re someone who doesn’t care about that, then the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review) or even the Redmi Note 5 (Review) are two models that we’d recommend over the Redmi 6 Pro, especially the variant we reviewed. Can Motorola One Power dethrone the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Redmi 6 Pro?

Also, Xiaomi has for some reason found a really awkward spot for the notification LED - the bottom left portion of the chin - despite there seemingly being plenty of free space in the notch. In the box, the Redmi 6 Pro ships with a clear case, a SIM eject tool, a USB cable, and a 10W power adapter. The phone uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 625 SoC, which is a couple of years old now but is still a capable chip for general tasks. Gaming performance isn’t great, as some popular games like PUBG default to the lowest graphics settings, and even then, gameplay isn’t smooth. Our unit was running on a pre-release version of its MIUI software, which prevented us from running most benchmarks. Xiaomi did confirm with us that other than this, the software is identical to what retail units will ship with. AnTuTu managed to run, and it returned a decent score of 79,025 points. The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is available in two variants — one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and the other with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, which is the one we’re testing. The phone supports Bluetooth 4.2, dual-band 802.11 Wi-Fi a/b/g/n, GPS, USB-OTG, and GLONASS. It also has a gyroscope, ambient light sensor, compass, and an accelerometer. There’s FM radio too, but NFC is not present. MIUI offers plenty of gestures and customisation options   Our unit was running on MIUI 9.6, which is based on Android 8.1 Oreo. It had the slightly old July security patch. The Redmi 6 series will be updated to MIUI 10 soon, according to Xiaomi. MIUI offers gestures and customisable functions that are similar to what we’ve seen before. The leftmost home screen gives you a card-style layout for app shortcuts, stock prices, calendar events, etc. The Mi Store app gives you a curated list of apps and games from the Play Store, but it also sends annoying spammy notifications now and then, which we couldn’t disable. The same goes for the Mi Community app, but at least this can be uninstalled. The phone comes with several preinstalled apps for social networking, banking, video streaming, and browsing the Web. For navigating Android, you can either stick with the default three-button system, or switch to gestures. These work quite well, and we ended up using them a lot, but we did face one issue. The ‘Back’ gesture requires a swipe inwards from the left or right edges of the display. This means that when you try to access the menus in apps like Slack with the same gesture, you end up closing the app or going a step back unintentionally. Although Xiaomi has provided the option to mask the notch, MIUI doesn’t always scale well to the reduced aspect ratio. We saw portions of some menu buttons and even content in some apps getting cut off due to the masking. Face recognition is supported, and it works well under most lighting conditions, except in a pitch darkness. The Redmi 6 Pro is not particularly slim, but it's easy to handle   The Redmi 6 Pro works well with casual usage. The interface feels fluid, face recognition is quick, and it doesn’t heat up. Simpler games such as Alto’s Odyssey ran well, but more graphically demanding ones like Breakneck and even PUBG had to be played at medium to low settings. Despite having 4GB of RAM, we did notice that load times in games were a bit long, and multitasking between apps wasn't always stutter-free. We found that colours were vivid and punchy on the Redmi 6 Pro's screen, which makes this a good device for watching videos. Audio performance is good when using headphones but the speaker doesn’t get too loud for media playback. The stock music player has Hungama Music integration, and lets you stream audio tracks. The default video player, on the other hand, curates trending music videos (mostly Bollywood ones) from YouTube in addition to showing you your local files. The rear 12-megapixel camera has an f/2.2 aperture with PDAF. Autofocus was decently quick in good light. There’s auto-HDR , which did a good job of balancing the exposure in our experience. We observed good detail in landscape shots in daylight, and colours were pleasing too. The main sensor stumbled a bit with macros, as it simply wasn't able to resolve finer detail. The white balance was a bit of a hit or a miss in close-ups, and we often found ourselves having to tap-to-focus to get the white balance back on track. Saving HDR images takes a good couple of seconds in daylight. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro camera samples   In low light, autofocus speed dropped quite a bit, and it took longer to save regular images as well. It’s best to leave HDR off, as the time taken to save images increases even more, which makes it even more challenging to get blur-free shots at night. Details were quite mushy due to the noise reduction process, and colours were a bit dull. The camera app is simple and easy to use, with all the shooting modes just a swipe away. Portrait mode takes advantage of the secondary 5-megapixel camera on the back. However, edge detection was quite average, and we couldn't adjust the level of blur before or after taking a shot. The 5-megapixel front camera took okay selfies under good light, but due to the lack of screen flash, low-light images turned out grainy. Video performance was quite decent, and stabilisation worked well, with no visible jelly effect around the edges of the frame. The maximum resolution you can shoot at is 1080p. Battery life is one of the strong suits of the Redmi 6 Pro. The 4000mAh battery easily lasted us a full day and a bit more on one charge. Playing heavy games didn't drain the battery too much either. In a single round of PUBG (around 30 minutes), in which we survived till the very end, we recorded a drop of around seven percent, which is not bad. In our internal video loop test, we got a runtime of 16 hours and 45 minutes, which is very good. The Redmi 6 Pro doesn’t support fast charging, but the bundled 10W adapter gave us roughly a 55 percent charge in an hour, and it took us roughly 2 hours and 35 minutes to charge it completely from zero. VerdictLooking at Xiaomi’s current Redmi lineup, the Redmi 6 Pro doesn’t make a very strong case for itself. There’s nothing terribly wrong with it, but at the same time, it doesn’t really offer anything new or different compared to the existing Redmi Note 5 (Review), which costs Rs. 1,000 less for the same amount of RAM and storage. You also have the Redmi Y2 (Review) at the exact same price as the Redmi 6 Pro, and that model has a better front camera, but you'd compromise a bit on the display and battery capacity. What Xiaomi has essentially done here is create a bit of confusion in its own lineup. However, notches seem to be in demand these days, so we can see buyers considering this option for that reason alone. If you’re someone who doesn’t care about that, then the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review) or even the Redmi Note 5 (Review) are two models that we’d recommend over the Redmi 6 Pro, especially the variant we reviewed. Can Motorola One Power dethrone the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Redmi 6 Pro?

2415,21,xiaomi-redmi-6-pro-review-1920819,7,10,2018-09-25,1920819,Roydon Cerejo,Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-6-pro-review-1920819," The budget segment is usually where smartphone companies move the most volume, and in order to maintain its dominance, Xiaomi recently launched not one but three new budget Redmi smartphones. Today, we’ll be checking out the Redmi 6 Pro, which is supposed to be the most powerful in the new Redmi 6 series, and is the first Redmi phone outside the Redmi Note series to sport the ‘Pro’ moniker. Usually, Xiaomi uses this designation to indicate powerful hardware, and while the Redmi 6 Pro does have the strongest SoC of the new trio, the main differentiating factor for this model seems to be its notched display. This is also a first for a Redmi phone. Other than that, the Redmi 6 Pro seems to share most of its core specifications with existing Xiaomi models such as the Redmi Y2 (Review) and even the Redmi Note 5 (Review), which makes us wonder - other than the notch, does the Redmi 6 Pro bring anything drastically new to the table? We're about to find out.    Being the most premium phone of the new Redmi 6 family, the Redmi 6 Pro has been given somewhat better materials, in the form of a metal backplate. However, the overall design isn’t too different from what we’ve already seen from Xiaomi at around this price point. This is a fairly thick phone, and it's a bit hefty too, but it’s manageable. The buttons have good feedback without being noisy, and on the left side, you get a single tray which can hold two SIM cards and a separate microSD card. Something worth noting is that the Redmi 6 Pro does not support dual 4G VoLTE, which means that only one SIM can connect to a 4G network at a time. The placement of ports is good. The mono speaker is on the bottom right, so chances of blocking it when using the phone in landscape mode are slim. The headphone socket is placed on the top, and you also get an infrared (IR) emitter which can be used to control IR appliances through the Mi Remote app. The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro has a metal backplate and dual rear cameras   Our test unit is the black variant, which has a matte finish so it doesn’t pick up smudges very easily. You can also buy the Redmi 6 Pro in blue, red, or gold. The fingerprint sensor is easy to reach and is responsive. There’s a vertically stacked dual camera setup at the back, which protrudes only slightly, so it’s not much of an inconvenience. The main highlight of the Redmi 6 Pro is of course its 5.84-inch full-HD+ display. The contrast and brightness are adequate. Xiaomi tells Gadgets 360 that the display has a layer of toughened glass, although the company wouldn’t specify the vendor. The notch results in a bit more display area, but it's pretty massive.

The leftmost home screen gives you a card-style layout for app shortcuts, stock prices, calendar events, etc. The Mi Store app gives you a curated list of apps and games from the Play Store, but it also sends annoying spammy notifications now and then, which we couldn’t disable. The same goes for the Mi Community app, but at least this can be uninstalled. The phone comes with several preinstalled apps for social networking, banking, video streaming, and browsing the Web. For navigating Android, you can either stick with the default three-button system, or switch to gestures. These work quite well, and we ended up using them a lot, but we did face one issue. The ‘Back’ gesture requires a swipe inwards from the left or right edges of the display. This means that when you try to access the menus in apps like Slack with the same gesture, you end up closing the app or going a step back unintentionally. Although Xiaomi has provided the option to mask the notch, MIUI doesn’t always scale well to the reduced aspect ratio. We saw portions of some menu buttons and even content in some apps getting cut off due to the masking. Face recognition is supported, and it works well under most lighting conditions, except in a pitch darkness. The Redmi 6 Pro is not particularly slim, but it's easy to handle   The Redmi 6 Pro works well with casual usage. The interface feels fluid, face recognition is quick, and it doesn’t heat up. Simpler games such as Alto’s Odyssey ran well, but more graphically demanding ones like Breakneck and even PUBG had to be played at medium to low settings. Despite having 4GB of RAM, we did notice that load times in games were a bit long, and multitasking between apps wasn't always stutter-free. We found that colours were vivid and punchy on the Redmi 6 Pro's screen, which makes this a good device for watching videos. Audio performance is good when using headphones but the speaker doesn’t get too loud for media playback. The stock music player has Hungama Music integration, and lets you stream audio tracks. The default video player, on the other hand, curates trending music videos (mostly Bollywood ones) from YouTube in addition to showing you your local files. The rear 12-megapixel camera has an f/2.2 aperture with PDAF. Autofocus was decently quick in good light. There’s auto-HDR , which did a good job of balancing the exposure in our experience. We observed good detail in landscape shots in daylight, and colours were pleasing too. The main sensor stumbled a bit with macros, as it simply wasn't able to resolve finer detail. The white balance was a bit of a hit or a miss in close-ups, and we often found ourselves having to tap-to-focus to get the white balance back on track. Saving HDR images takes a good couple of seconds in daylight.

It’s best to leave HDR off, as the time taken to save images increases even more, which makes it even more challenging to get blur-free shots at night. Details were quite mushy due to the noise reduction process, and colours were a bit dull. The camera app is simple and easy to use, with all the shooting modes just a swipe away. Portrait mode takes advantage of the secondary 5-megapixel camera on the back. However, edge detection was quite average, and we couldn't adjust the level of blur before or after taking a shot. The 5-megapixel front camera took okay selfies under good light, but due to the lack of screen flash, low-light images turned out grainy. Video performance was quite decent, and stabilisation worked well, with no visible jelly effect around the edges of the frame. The maximum resolution you can shoot at is 1080p. Battery life is one of the strong suits of the Redmi 6 Pro. The 4000mAh battery easily lasted us a full day and a bit more on one charge. Playing heavy games didn't drain the battery too much either. In a single round of PUBG (around 30 minutes), in which we survived till the very end, we recorded a drop of around seven percent, which is not bad. In our internal video loop test, we got a runtime of 16 hours and 45 minutes, which is very good. The Redmi 6 Pro doesn’t support fast charging, but the bundled 10W adapter gave us roughly a 55 percent charge in an hour, and it took us roughly 2 hours and 35 minutes to charge it completely from zero. VerdictLooking at Xiaomi’s current Redmi lineup, the Redmi 6 Pro doesn’t make a very strong case for itself. There’s nothing terribly wrong with it, but at the same time, it doesn’t really offer anything new or different compared to the existing Redmi Note 5 (Review), which costs Rs. 1,000 less for the same amount of RAM and storage. You also have the Redmi Y2 (Review) at the exact same price as the Redmi 6 Pro, and that model has a better front camera, but you'd compromise a bit on the display and battery capacity. What Xiaomi has essentially done here is create a bit of confusion in its own lineup. However, notches seem to be in demand these days, so we can see buyers considering this option for that reason alone. If you’re someone who doesn’t care about that, then the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review) or even the Redmi Note 5 (Review) are two models that we’d recommend over the Redmi 6 Pro, especially the variant we reviewed. Can Motorola One Power dethrone the Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Redmi 6 Pro?

2413,21,xiaomi-redmi-6-review-1920449,7,10,2018-09-27,1920449,Aditya Shenoy,Xiaomi Redmi 6 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-6-review-1920449," Xiaomi recently launched the Redmi 6 in India, along with the Redmi 6A (Review) and the Redmi 6 Pro (Review). As its name suggests, it is the successor of the Redmi 5 (Review), which has been fairly popular for offering good hardware at affordable prices. The Redmi 6 gets a new processor, has interesting specifications on paper, and is positioned between the Redmi 6A and the Redmi 6 Pro. We have seen smartphones with good hardware but most of them are concentrated around the Rs. 10,000 mark. The Redmi 6 seems to have good hardware at a starting price in India of Rs. 7,999, but is it the best you can get for the price? We put it to the test.    The Redmi series is the entry-level lineup from Xiaomi, and the company has chosen materials to keep the price down. The Redmi 6 is primarily made out of plastic and is built well. It has a 5.45-inch display with a tall and narrow 18:9 aspect ratio. Also on the front of the phone, you’ll find the selfie camera, earpiece, sensors, and a white notification LED that’s tucked in a corner. The back of the Redmi 6 is made out of plastic and is curved at the sides which makes this phone comfortable to hold. Xiaomi has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right, and they offer good feedback. We found the positioning of the power button to be spot on, but the volume buttons are positioned a little too high for our comfort.    On the left side, the phone has two trays. One has the primary SIM and a dedicated microSD card slots, while the other is for the secondary SIM. The loudspeaker is at the back of the phone, while the Micro-USB port is at the bottom along with the primary microphone. The Redmi 6 has a 3.5mm headphone jack and a secondary microphone at the top, but there is no IR emitter, commonly found on Xiaomi smartphones. At the back, the dual-camera module is positioned towards the left, along with a single-LED flash. The fingerprint scanner is well positioned, and either of your index fingers will rest on it naturally when holding this phone. The Redmi 6 is light, weighing 146gms. It packs in a 3000mAh non-removable battery, and Xiaomi ships a 5W charger in the box to top it up. Like most other Xiaomi smartphones in this price range, the Redmi 6 does not come with headphones in the box. You can take a look at some of the best headphones under Rs. 1,000 in our roundup if you need to buy a pair on a tight budget. When it comes to the internals of the Redmi 6, Xiaomi has taken a slightly different approach than usual. Most of Xiaomi’s lineup so far has been powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors, but the Redmi 6 and the Redmi 6A are powered by MediaTek processors. The Redmi 6 sports a MediaTek Helio P22. This is an octa-core processor based on a 12nm manufacturing process, and it’s clocked at 2GHz. This phone comes in two variants; one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and the other with 3GB RAM and 64GB of storage. You can expand storage as this phone accepts microSD cards of up to 256GB.    The Redmi 6’s screen has an HD+ resolution, which works out to 295 pixels per inch. It has decent viewing angles and you do get the option to tweak the display output. While the display is legible under direct sunlight, we would have preferred slightly better brightness. The dual camera setup at the back consists of a 12-megapixel primary camera and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. There is dual-SIM support on the Redmi 6 with support for both 4G as well as VoLTE. A toggle in the settings app lets the second SIM access data on a 4G network when the primary one is on a call. There is support for Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, GPS, AGPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, and FM Radio. The Redmi 6 also has ambient light and proximity sensors, along with an electronic compass. The software running on the Redmi 6 is pretty much predictable. This phone runs MIUI 9.6 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo. When we unboxed the smartphone, it was running the June security patch, but soon received the July and August updates. If you have used MIUI and like the user interface, you’ll feel at home while using this smartphone. Xiaomi has made lots of customisations that deviate from the stock Android experience, but there are a few useful features. There is support for multiple gestures and you can also use gesture navigation instead of the traditional navigation buttons. The Redmi 6 features face recognition which lets you unlock it. It isn’t the quickest, but it worked in most lighting conditions. Spammy notifications by preinstalled apps, Dual-SIM settings on the Redmi 6   There are useful additions like Dual Apps, which lets you run two instances of supported apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook, among others. Second Space lets you keep files, messages, and other data locked down. MIUI also has an inbuilt App Lock that lets you restrict access to apps using your fingerprint. While MIUI has some interesting features, it does come with a fair amount of bloatware. Microsoft’s suite of apps come preinstalled, along with Amazon, Netflix, Facebook, PhonePe, and UC Browser. Xiaomi’s own apps including Mi Community, Mi Video, Mi Store, Mi Drop, Security, and Cleaner also find spots on the Redmi 6. Apart from the Google Play Store, there’s another store called Apps. We found some of Xiaomi’s apps to be spammy, and annoying notifications kept on popping up. While you can go ahead and uninstall most of these apps, some can only be disabled. The Helio P22 powering the Redmi 6 managed to surprise us with its performance. We could go through the menus and scroll through MIUI without any noticeable lag or stutter. However, like with most low-end processors, it takes some time to load heavy apps. We also saw instances when the Redmi 6 had to reload apps since they were no longer in memory. We ran a couple of benchmarks to gauge the performance of the Redmi 6, and got some interesting results. It scored 75,723 points in AnTuTu, and 820 and 3580 in Geekbench 4’s single-core and multi-core tests respectively. It managed 584 in 3DMark Slingshot, 8051 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme, and 26fps in GFXBench T-Rex. The Redmi 6 is faster than its predecessor, the Redmi 5, in almost every test. The Redmi 6 was capable of running PUBG but switched to the lowest settings by default. The game was playable but we did notice input lag. We were also pleased with the battery performance of this smartphone. In our HD video loop test, it managed to go on for 14 hours and 34 minutes. We took the phone off its charger at 9am and managed to end our day at 10pm with 27 percent still left. During the day, we used Google Maps for navigation for an hour, spent 30 minutes playing PUBG, ran a few benchmarks, and took multiple photos and videos for our camera tests. If you have a similar usage pattern, you should be able to get through one full day of use. When you do plug this phone into the supplied 5W charger, it charges to 18 percent in 30 minutes, and 35 percent in an hour. The camera app on the Redmi 6 is identical to what we have seen on other Xiaomi smartphones. It has Short Video, Portrait, Square, Panorama, and Manual modes apart from the usual Photo and Video modes. In Manual mode, you get control over White Balance, Focus, Shutter Speed, and ISO. The app has quick toggles for HDR and filters. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi 6 camera samples   Photos taken with the Redmi 6 in favourable light were good, but we saw a drop in quality in low light. In daylight, the Redmi 6 managed to get the metering right and was quick to enable HDR automatically when shooting in bright environments. The phone manages to capture decent amount of detail. When shooting macros, the phone struggled to focus on tiny objects and we couldn’t get a sharp photo of tiny flowers. The Redmi 6 uses its secondary 5-megapixel sensor to deliver good portrait shots. It manages good edge detection and it could detect the gap between a person’s arm and body, and blur it properly. Camera performance went down a notch in low light. It failed to capture good details, and the aggressive noise reduction resulted in a watercolour effect. Selfies taken with the Redmi 6 were good when shot outdoors, but appeared dull when shot indoors. Video recording maxes out at 1080p for both the front and the rear cameras. There is stabilisation, but we observed a jelly effect in the recorded video. VerdictThe Redmi 6 is priced starting at Rs. 7,999. It has decent hardware for the price and it offers better performance than the smartphone it replaces. The base variant with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage offers better value and does not have a lot of competition to deal with. However, if you are eyeing the higher variant that is priced at Rs. 9,499, you might want to take a look at the RealMe 1 (Review) and the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review) instead, because both of them offer much better performance for a slightly higher price.

In daylight, the Redmi 6 managed to get the metering right and was quick to enable HDR automatically when shooting in bright environments. The phone manages to capture decent amount of detail. When shooting macros, the phone struggled to focus on tiny objects and we couldn’t get a sharp photo of tiny flowers. The Redmi 6 uses its secondary 5-megapixel sensor to deliver good portrait shots. It manages good edge detection and it could detect the gap between a person’s arm and body, and blur it properly. Camera performance went down a notch in low light. It failed to capture good details, and the aggressive noise reduction resulted in a watercolour effect. Selfies taken with the Redmi 6 were good when shot outdoors, but appeared dull when shot indoors. Video recording maxes out at 1080p for both the front and the rear cameras. There is stabilisation, but we observed a jelly effect in the recorded video. VerdictThe Redmi 6 is priced starting at Rs. 7,999. It has decent hardware for the price and it offers better performance than the smartphone it replaces. The base variant with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage offers better value and does not have a lot of competition to deal with. However, if you are eyeing the higher variant that is priced at Rs. 9,499, you might want to take a look at the RealMe 1 (Review) and the Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review) instead, because both of them offer much better performance for a slightly higher price.

2413,21,xiaomi-redmi-6-review-1920449,7,10,2018-09-27,1920449,Aditya Shenoy,Xiaomi Redmi 6 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-6-review-1920449," Xiaomi recently launched the Redmi 6 in India, along with the Redmi 6A (Review) and the Redmi 6 Pro (Review). As its name suggests, it is the successor of the Redmi 5 (Review), which has been fairly popular for offering good hardware at affordable prices. The Redmi 6 gets a new processor, has interesting specifications on paper, and is positioned between the Redmi 6A and the Redmi 6 Pro. We have seen smartphones with good hardware but most of them are concentrated around the Rs. 10,000 mark. The Redmi 6 seems to have good hardware at a starting price in India of Rs. 7,999, but is it the best you can get for the price? We put it to the test.    The Redmi series is the entry-level lineup from Xiaomi, and the company has chosen materials to keep the price down. The Redmi 6 is primarily made out of plastic and is built well. It has a 5.45-inch display with a tall and narrow 18:9 aspect ratio. Also on the front of the phone, you’ll find the selfie camera, earpiece, sensors, and a white notification LED that’s tucked in a corner. The back of the Redmi 6 is made out of plastic and is curved at the sides which makes this phone comfortable to hold. Xiaomi has positioned the power and volume buttons on the right, and they offer good feedback. We found the positioning of the power button to be spot on, but the volume buttons are positioned a little too high for our comfort.    On the left side, the phone has two trays. One has the primary SIM and a dedicated microSD card slots, while the other is for the secondary SIM. The loudspeaker is at the back of the phone, while the Micro-USB port is at the bottom along with the primary microphone. The Redmi 6 has a 3.5mm headphone jack and a secondary microphone at the top, but there is no IR emitter, commonly found on Xiaomi smartphones. At the back, the dual-camera module is positioned towards the left, along with a single-LED flash. The fingerprint scanner is well positioned, and either of your index fingers will rest on it naturally when holding this phone. The Redmi 6 is light, weighing 146gms. It packs in a 3000mAh non-removable battery, and Xiaomi ships a 5W charger in the box to top it up. Like most other Xiaomi smartphones in this price range, the Redmi 6 does not come with headphones in the box. You can take a look at some of the best headphones under Rs. 1,000 in our roundup if you need to buy a pair on a tight budget. When it comes to the internals of the Redmi 6, Xiaomi has taken a slightly different approach than usual. Most of Xiaomi’s lineup so far has been powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon processors, but the Redmi 6 and the Redmi 6A are powered by MediaTek processors. The Redmi 6 sports a MediaTek Helio P22. This is an octa-core processor based on a 12nm manufacturing process, and it’s clocked at 2GHz. This phone comes in two variants; one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and the other with 3GB RAM and 64GB of storage. You can expand storage as this phone accepts microSD cards of up to 256GB.    The Redmi 6’s screen has an HD+ resolution, which works out to 295 pixels per inch. It has decent viewing angles and you do get the option to tweak the display output. While the display is legible under direct sunlight, we would have preferred slightly better brightness. The dual camera setup at the back consists of a 12-megapixel primary camera and a 5-megapixel depth sensor. There is dual-SIM support on the Redmi 6 with support for both 4G as well as VoLTE. A toggle in the settings app lets the second SIM access data on a 4G network when the primary one is on a call. There is support for Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, GPS, AGPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, and FM Radio. The Redmi 6 also has ambient light and proximity sensors, along with an electronic compass. The software running on the Redmi 6 is pretty much predictable. This phone runs MIUI 9.6 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo. When we unboxed the smartphone, it was running the June security patch, but soon received the July and August updates. If you have used MIUI and like the user interface, you’ll feel at home while using this smartphone. Xiaomi has made lots of customisations that deviate from the stock Android experience, but there are a few useful features. There is support for multiple gestures and you can also use gesture navigation instead of the traditional navigation buttons. The Redmi 6 features face recognition which lets you unlock it. It isn’t the quickest, but it worked in most lighting conditions. Spammy notifications by preinstalled apps, Dual-SIM settings on the Redmi 6   There are useful additions like Dual Apps, which lets you run two instances of supported apps such as WhatsApp and Facebook, among others. Second Space lets you keep files, messages, and other data locked down. MIUI also has an inbuilt App Lock that lets you restrict access to apps using your fingerprint. While MIUI has some interesting features, it does come with a fair amount of bloatware. Microsoft’s suite of apps come preinstalled, along with Amazon, Netflix, Facebook, PhonePe, and UC Browser. Xiaomi’s own apps including Mi Community, Mi Video, Mi Store, Mi Drop, Security, and Cleaner also find spots on the Redmi 6. Apart from the Google Play Store, there’s another store called Apps. We found some of Xiaomi’s apps to be spammy, and annoying notifications kept on popping up. While you can go ahead and uninstall most of these apps, some can only be disabled. The Helio P22 powering the Redmi 6 managed to surprise us with its performance. We could go through the menus and scroll through MIUI without any noticeable lag or stutter. However, like with most low-end processors, it takes some time to load heavy apps. We also saw instances when the Redmi 6 had to reload apps since they were no longer in memory. We ran a couple of benchmarks to gauge the performance of the Redmi 6, and got some interesting results. It scored 75,723 points in AnTuTu, and 820 and 3580 in Geekbench 4’s single-core and multi-core tests respectively. It managed 584 in 3DMark Slingshot, 8051 in 3DMark Ice Storm Extreme, and 26fps in GFXBench T-Rex. The Redmi 6 is faster than its predecessor, the Redmi 5, in almost every test. The Redmi 6 was capable of running PUBG but switched to the lowest settings by default. The game was playable but we did notice input lag. We were also pleased with the battery performance of this smartphone. In our HD video loop test, it managed to go on for 14 hours and 34 minutes. We took the phone off its charger at 9am and managed to end our day at 10pm with 27 percent still left. During the day, we used Google Maps for navigation for an hour, spent 30 minutes playing PUBG, ran a few benchmarks, and took multiple photos and videos for our camera tests. If you have a similar usage pattern, you should be able to get through one full day of use. When you do plug this phone into the supplied 5W charger, it charges to 18 percent in 30 minutes, and 35 percent in an hour. The camera app on the Redmi 6 is identical to what we have seen on other Xiaomi smartphones. It has Short Video, Portrait, Square, Panorama, and Manual modes apart from the usual Photo and Video modes. In Manual mode, you get control over White Balance, Focus, Shutter Speed, and ISO. The app has quick toggles for HDR and filters.

2417,21,xiaomi-redmi-6a-review-1919103,7,10,2018-09-25,1919103,Jamshed Avari,Xiaomi Redmi 6A Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-6a-review-1919103," Xiaomi's Redmi phones have pretty much established themselves as the de-facto choices at nearly every price point in the budget space. The Chinese brand, once considered a tiny upstart, has consistently launched smartphones that deliver tremendous value for money and make their competitors look overpriced. We've repeatedly wondered how far Xiaomi can push this formula, and whether any other company will be able to come in and steal its thunder. That has happened to some extent at the upper end of the low-cost market this year, with players including Asus, Oppo (and now its spin-off Realme), and Infinix launching disruptive models that have earned praise from us. The bottom end, though, is still where Xiaomi dominates. The brand new Redmi 6 models have been launched specifically to reinforce that position, and the Redmi 6A is the very lowest priced model of them all. Starting at just Rs. 5,999 — though this is an ""introductory price"" — the Redmi 6A neatly replaces the Redmi 5A (Review) and brings just enough updates and new features to fend off newer competitors. Let's see what's new, and whether this phone is still the best choice for people on a shoe-string budget.    The first thing you'll notice about this phone is that Xiaomi has brought a fashionable 18:9 screen to the very bottom of its price ladder. The front of this phone is simple and plain, and when it's off, the front camera and earpiece are the only things that will indicate which way is up. The screen has very slightly rounded corners, which is a nice touch. You don't get a bezel-free look at this price and there's quite a bit of space to the top, bottom and sides of the screen, but the overall look is still fairly slick. The body of the Redmi 6A is all plastic, which shouldn't come as any surprise. This phone is available in four colours — black, blue, gold, and rose gold. Our black review unit looked good, though some smudges did become apparent on the rear over the course of multiple days. There's a camera bump, but thankfully it isn't too noticeable. The body's curves and contours somewhat mask its 8.3mm thickness and make it very easy to live with. This phone weighs just 145g, which helps as well. The power and volume buttons are on the right, and both are well within reach. On the left, there are two individual trays - one for a single Nano-SIM, and the other for another Nano-SIM and also a separate microSD card. You'll find a 3.5mm audio socket on the top and a Micro-USB port on the bottom, plus microphone pinholes next to both. The speaker is on the lower rear which means that your ringtone and alerts could be muffled when this phone is lying on a bed or other soft surface. There's no fingerprint reader — while we have seen phones with fingerprint readers at around this price level, Xiaomi has chosen other priorities.  There usually isn't much to get excited about in the budget market, but Xiaomi has found at least one little advantage to give its latest entry-level phone. Rather than the predictable Qualcomm 400-series, Xiaomi has switched to MediaTek's brand new Helio A22 (MT6762) processor. This marks the debut of a new Helio A-series branding scheme for MediaTek's entry-level offerings. The Helio A22 has four ARM Cortex-A53 cores running at up to 2GHz and is manufactured using a power-efficient 12nm process. This could give battery life a significant boost. The Redmi 6A is available with either 16GB or 32GB of storage, and both variants have 2GB of RAM. Our review unit was the 16GB version, and we found that we had just under 10GB of usable space when setting it up. If you aren't planning to carry a lot of music and videos around with you, this much should be fine, but you'll need a microSD card otherwise, with cards of up to 256GB capacity supported. The 18:9 screen measures 5.45 inches diagonally and has a resolution of 720x1440 pixels. Xiaomi has packed in a 3000mAh battery. The rear camera has a 13-megapixel sensor, f/2.2 aperture, and PDAF, while the front one has a 5-megapixel sensor. The Redmi 6A can use 4G data on either SIM. VoLTE HD is supported on only one SIM at a time, regardless of which slot it's in. There's also Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, and GPS. Interestingly, you get the standard ambient light and proximity sensors as well as a digital compass. One of Xiaomi's defining smartphone features is its custom MIUI software, which has a vocal legion of fans. The Redmi 6A runs MIUI 9.6 which is based on Android 8.1. Our unit had already received the August 2018 Android security patch. There's no official word on any release timeframe for an update to Android 9.0 Pie. MIUI hasn't changed much over the years, and with stock Android One gaining popularity, it's beginning to show. We missed common features like the ability to long-press an app icon for quick shortcuts and notifications.    There's a lot of preloaded bloat and redundant apps, for example you have UC Browser, Chrome, and Xiaomi's own default browser. Facebook, Amazon, PhonePe, Netflix, Opera, and a few other third-party apps are preloaded, and several more are ""promoted"" right within the MIUI interface. The default Facemoji keyboard has a lot going on with emojis, stickers, GIFs, themes, and more. Then there are also Microsoft apps and assorted Mi utilities. The one big thing that immediately jumped out at us was the amount of advertising that's now baked into MIUI. We saw a few spammy alerts from the Mi Apps store using peer-pressure tactics to try to make us download specific apps. Moreover, there were full-screen interstitial ads whenever we launched the Themes app or used the Storage Cleaner function within the Settings app, and there were ads in the Security app as well. Very few of these apps can be removed. Mi Music and Mi Video are also full of promotional content. There’s even spam in the Gallery app — sporadically, after playing a video clip we had recorded, we saw a screen of suggestions for Hungama videos. We were extremely disappointed to see how much advertising there was. Much of it only became apparent after a few days of use, so it's possible that there's even more, deeper beneath the surface, waiting to jump out at users. If this is the tradeoff for low-cost phones, we wouldn't be surprised to see even hardcore Xiaomi fans gravitating towards stock Android. That isn't to say that MIUI is all bad. It still has loads of features including Ui customisation options, the ability to clone apps, fine-grained display colour tone adjustment, useful gestures, and the ability to lock apps. There's face recognition, but Xiaomi warns that it might be defeated by a photo of you.  This is an entry-level phone, and we know that it isn't meant to be pushed too hard, but basic usage still needs to be smooth. Thankfully, we can say that the Redmi 6A — for the most part — was not frustrating to use. There was some lag when flipping through the task switcher or exiting from apps back to the home screen, but we could live with that. We also quickly learnt to avoid Xiaomi's Mi apps because the extra steps needed to dismiss ads all the time became too annoying. On rare occasions, it took a second or two for many apps, including the basic Messaging app, to be usable after loading. You can hide the on-screen Android navigation buttons and use gestures instead, but we found that to be extremely slow. The keyboard was also a bit of a problem, but Google's Gboard is preloaded and ready to go as an alternative. MIUI is strained with with only 2GB of RAM, and we noted anywhere between 650MB and 1.2GB free during use. The screen is good enough for watching videos and playing games on, and we had no major complaints in terms of vibrancy, colour reproduction, or viewing angles considering the price of this phone. The speaker on the back isn't very clear and music doesn't sound great, but voices in videos come through well enough. Benchmark tests gave us pretty decent results. We got 61,053 in AnTuTu, and 765 and 2,306 respectively in Geekbench's single-core and multi-core tests. The 20fps score in GFXBench's T-Rex test shows that 3D games won't run all that well, but you should be able to play casual puzzle titles without any trouble. 3DMark's Ice Storm Extreme test gave us a score of 5,451 and the Slingshot test score was 453. Xiaomi's phones have always surprised us with great performance in our HD video loop battery life test. The Redmi 6A ran for 13 hours, 22 minutes, thanks to its 3000mAh battery, the efficient SoC, and MIUI's optimisations. Our everyday usage consisted of a bit of light gaming and video streaming, and we comfortably made it through a 10-hour working day and the rest of the evening. If you don't use your phone for much more than calls, messages and social media, you should be able to stretch to a day and a half between charges. On the downside, a full charge from zero took us nearly three hours. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi 6A camera samples   Camera quality is typically where low-cost phones struggle the most. The Redmi 6A is obviously not going to be ideal if you need great photos, but it should be enough for people who just want to share their lives through social media and messaging apps. Our sample shots came out looking relatively good with acceptable levels of detail and sharp focus. There are a few shots in which we could see that focus had not locked on the ideal spot, and small bright objects or parts of the frame did get blown out quite badly. Colours were generally bright and vibrant too. At night, we definitely had to be careful about standing still and not shaking the phone, but shots were still fairly decent as long as there was a light source nearby. Areas in the shadows just came out looking completely black. One problem we found was that no matter what conditions we were shooting in, the Redmi 6A often took a full second or more to save a shot, leaving us waiting before we could take the next one. Video recording goes up to 1080p but it is shaky and a little jerky with constant minor focus shifts. Video taken in bright sunlight looked a bit artificial and oversharpened. The front camera does a serviceable job but again, this is entry-level quality and nothing beyond that. The camera app has time-lapse and panorama modes. Nice touches include an auto HDR setting, an on-screen level overlay to help you frame shots, a tilt-shift filter, and multiple scene modes. There is a manual mode as well, and buried within the settings panel are a few options for exposure and metering control.  VerdictThe Redmi 6A is a fairly good update to the Redmi 5A, which itself was barely any different compared to the Redmi 4A (Review). You now get a tall screen, better processor, and improved polish overall. However, the price has gone up — Rs. 5,999 is still very good, especially considering the recent slide in the Indian Rupee's exchange rate, but it isn't quite as tempting as the Redmi 5A was at Rs. 4,999. This is also just an ""introductory"" price, and we don't yet know how long it will last or what it will increase to after that. With this generation, you get 2GB of RAM across the board, rather than 3GB with the 32GB storage variant. If you can spend a little more money and want to step up the ladder, chances are you'll find the 3GB/ 32GB Redmi 6, with its fingerprint sensor and better processor, the better choice. As for the competition, the Redmi 6A delivers a superior experience compared to the equally priced Coolpad Mega 5A (Review) and the more expensive Honor 7S (Review), and even if its price rises by Rs. 1,000, we think it will remain the better option. MIUI has so far been very well received, and it is one of the most polished non-stock Android UIs we've seen. However, that goodwill can and will evaporate if Xiaomi continues pushing ads and spam like this. The company isn't competing with the likes of Intex and Micromax anymore, but with Android One and Android Go models. We hope that Xiaomi takes note before it's too late.

2417,21,xiaomi-redmi-6a-review-1919103,7,10,2018-09-25,1919103,Jamshed Avari,Xiaomi Redmi 6A Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-6a-review-1919103," Xiaomi's Redmi phones have pretty much established themselves as the de-facto choices at nearly every price point in the budget space. The Chinese brand, once considered a tiny upstart, has consistently launched smartphones that deliver tremendous value for money and make their competitors look overpriced. We've repeatedly wondered how far Xiaomi can push this formula, and whether any other company will be able to come in and steal its thunder. That has happened to some extent at the upper end of the low-cost market this year, with players including Asus, Oppo (and now its spin-off Realme), and Infinix launching disruptive models that have earned praise from us. The bottom end, though, is still where Xiaomi dominates. The brand new Redmi 6 models have been launched specifically to reinforce that position, and the Redmi 6A is the very lowest priced model of them all. Starting at just Rs. 5,999 — though this is an ""introductory price"" — the Redmi 6A neatly replaces the Redmi 5A (Review) and brings just enough updates and new features to fend off newer competitors. Let's see what's new, and whether this phone is still the best choice for people on a shoe-string budget.    The first thing you'll notice about this phone is that Xiaomi has brought a fashionable 18:9 screen to the very bottom of its price ladder. The front of this phone is simple and plain, and when it's off, the front camera and earpiece are the only things that will indicate which way is up. The screen has very slightly rounded corners, which is a nice touch. You don't get a bezel-free look at this price and there's quite a bit of space to the top, bottom and sides of the screen, but the overall look is still fairly slick. The body of the Redmi 6A is all plastic, which shouldn't come as any surprise. This phone is available in four colours — black, blue, gold, and rose gold. Our black review unit looked good, though some smudges did become apparent on the rear over the course of multiple days. There's a camera bump, but thankfully it isn't too noticeable. The body's curves and contours somewhat mask its 8.3mm thickness and make it very easy to live with. This phone weighs just 145g, which helps as well. The power and volume buttons are on the right, and both are well within reach. On the left, there are two individual trays - one for a single Nano-SIM, and the other for another Nano-SIM and also a separate microSD card. You'll find a 3.5mm audio socket on the top and a Micro-USB port on the bottom, plus microphone pinholes next to both. The speaker is on the lower rear which means that your ringtone and alerts could be muffled when this phone is lying on a bed or other soft surface. There's no fingerprint reader — while we have seen phones with fingerprint readers at around this price level, Xiaomi has chosen other priorities.  There usually isn't much to get excited about in the budget market, but Xiaomi has found at least one little advantage to give its latest entry-level phone. Rather than the predictable Qualcomm 400-series, Xiaomi has switched to MediaTek's brand new Helio A22 (MT6762) processor. This marks the debut of a new Helio A-series branding scheme for MediaTek's entry-level offerings. The Helio A22 has four ARM Cortex-A53 cores running at up to 2GHz and is manufactured using a power-efficient 12nm process. This could give battery life a significant boost.

On the downside, a full charge from zero took us nearly three hours. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi 6A camera samples   Camera quality is typically where low-cost phones struggle the most. The Redmi 6A is obviously not going to be ideal if you need great photos, but it should be enough for people who just want to share their lives through social media and messaging apps. Our sample shots came out looking relatively good with acceptable levels of detail and sharp focus. There are a few shots in which we could see that focus had not locked on the ideal spot, and small bright objects or parts of the frame did get blown out quite badly. Colours were generally bright and vibrant too. At night, we definitely had to be careful about standing still and not shaking the phone, but shots were still fairly decent as long as there was a light source nearby. Areas in the shadows just came out looking completely black. One problem we found was that no matter what conditions we were shooting in, the Redmi 6A often took a full second or more to save a shot, leaving us waiting before we could take the next one. Video recording goes up to 1080p but it is shaky and a little jerky with constant minor focus shifts. Video taken in bright sunlight looked a bit artificial and oversharpened. The front camera does a serviceable job but again, this is entry-level quality and nothing beyond that. The camera app has time-lapse and panorama modes. Nice touches include an auto HDR setting, an on-screen level overlay to help you frame shots, a tilt-shift filter, and multiple scene modes. There is a manual mode as well, and buried within the settings panel are a few options for exposure and metering control.  VerdictThe Redmi 6A is a fairly good update to the Redmi 5A, which itself was barely any different compared to the Redmi 4A (Review). You now get a tall screen, better processor, and improved polish overall. However, the price has gone up — Rs. 5,999 is still very good, especially considering the recent slide in the Indian Rupee's exchange rate, but it isn't quite as tempting as the Redmi 5A was at Rs. 4,999. This is also just an ""introductory"" price, and we don't yet know how long it will last or what it will increase to after that. With this generation, you get 2GB of RAM across the board, rather than 3GB with the 32GB storage variant. If you can spend a little more money and want to step up the ladder, chances are you'll find the 3GB/ 32GB Redmi 6, with its fingerprint sensor and better processor, the better choice. As for the competition, the Redmi 6A delivers a superior experience compared to the equally priced Coolpad Mega 5A (Review) and the more expensive Honor 7S (Review), and even if its price rises by Rs. 1,000, we think it will remain the better option. MIUI has so far been very well received, and it is one of the most polished non-stock Android UIs we've seen. However, that goodwill can and will evaporate if Xiaomi continues pushing ads and spam like this. The company isn't competing with the likes of Intex and Micromax anymore, but with Android One and Android Go models. We hope that Xiaomi takes note before it's too late. Are Redmi 6A and Redmi 6 the best budget smartphones in India?

2417,21,xiaomi-redmi-6a-review-1919103,7,10,2018-09-25,1919103,Jamshed Avari,Xiaomi Redmi 6A Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-6a-review-1919103," Xiaomi's Redmi phones have pretty much established themselves as the de-facto choices at nearly every price point in the budget space. The Chinese brand, once considered a tiny upstart, has consistently launched smartphones that deliver tremendous value for money and make their competitors look overpriced. We've repeatedly wondered how far Xiaomi can push this formula, and whether any other company will be able to come in and steal its thunder. That has happened to some extent at the upper end of the low-cost market this year, with players including Asus, Oppo (and now its spin-off Realme), and Infinix launching disruptive models that have earned praise from us. The bottom end, though, is still where Xiaomi dominates. The brand new Redmi 6 models have been launched specifically to reinforce that position, and the Redmi 6A is the very lowest priced model of them all. Starting at just Rs. 5,999 — though this is an ""introductory price"" — the Redmi 6A neatly replaces the Redmi 5A (Review) and brings just enough updates and new features to fend off newer competitors. Let's see what's new, and whether this phone is still the best choice for people on a shoe-string budget.    The first thing you'll notice about this phone is that Xiaomi has brought a fashionable 18:9 screen to the very bottom of its price ladder. The front of this phone is simple and plain, and when it's off, the front camera and earpiece are the only things that will indicate which way is up. The screen has very slightly rounded corners, which is a nice touch. You don't get a bezel-free look at this price and there's quite a bit of space to the top, bottom and sides of the screen, but the overall look is still fairly slick. The body of the Redmi 6A is all plastic, which shouldn't come as any surprise. This phone is available in four colours — black, blue, gold, and rose gold. Our black review unit looked good, though some smudges did become apparent on the rear over the course of multiple days. There's a camera bump, but thankfully it isn't too noticeable. The body's curves and contours somewhat mask its 8.3mm thickness and make it very easy to live with. This phone weighs just 145g, which helps as well. The power and volume buttons are on the right, and both are well within reach. On the left, there are two individual trays - one for a single Nano-SIM, and the other for another Nano-SIM and also a separate microSD card. You'll find a 3.5mm audio socket on the top and a Micro-USB port on the bottom, plus microphone pinholes next to both. The speaker is on the lower rear which means that your ringtone and alerts could be muffled when this phone is lying on a bed or other soft surface. There's no fingerprint reader — while we have seen phones with fingerprint readers at around this price level, Xiaomi has chosen other priorities.  There usually isn't much to get excited about in the budget market, but Xiaomi has found at least one little advantage to give its latest entry-level phone. Rather than the predictable Qualcomm 400-series, Xiaomi has switched to MediaTek's brand new Helio A22 (MT6762) processor. This marks the debut of a new Helio A-series branding scheme for MediaTek's entry-level offerings. The Helio A22 has four ARM Cortex-A53 cores running at up to 2GHz and is manufactured using a power-efficient 12nm process. This could give battery life a significant boost. The Redmi 6A is available with either 16GB or 32GB of storage, and both variants have 2GB of RAM. Our review unit was the 16GB version, and we found that we had just under 10GB of usable space when setting it up. If you aren't planning to carry a lot of music and videos around with you, this much should be fine, but you'll need a microSD card otherwise, with cards of up to 256GB capacity supported. The 18:9 screen measures 5.45 inches diagonally and has a resolution of 720x1440 pixels. Xiaomi has packed in a 3000mAh battery. The rear camera has a 13-megapixel sensor, f/2.2 aperture, and PDAF, while the front one has a 5-megapixel sensor. The Redmi 6A can use 4G data on either SIM. VoLTE HD is supported on only one SIM at a time, regardless of which slot it's in. There's also Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth 4.2, and GPS. Interestingly, you get the standard ambient light and proximity sensors as well as a digital compass. One of Xiaomi's defining smartphone features is its custom MIUI software, which has a vocal legion of fans. The Redmi 6A runs MIUI 9.6 which is based on Android 8.1. Our unit had already received the August 2018 Android security patch. There's no official word on any release timeframe for an update to Android 9.0 Pie. MIUI hasn't changed much over the years, and with stock Android One gaining popularity, it's beginning to show. We missed common features like the ability to long-press an app icon for quick shortcuts and notifications.    There's a lot of preloaded bloat and redundant apps, for example you have UC Browser, Chrome, and Xiaomi's own default browser. Facebook, Amazon, PhonePe, Netflix, Opera, and a few other third-party apps are preloaded, and several more are ""promoted"" right within the MIUI interface. The default Facemoji keyboard has a lot going on with emojis, stickers, GIFs, themes, and more. Then there are also Microsoft apps and assorted Mi utilities. The one big thing that immediately jumped out at us was the amount of advertising that's now baked into MIUI. We saw a few spammy alerts from the Mi Apps store using peer-pressure tactics to try to make us download specific apps. Moreover, there were full-screen interstitial ads whenever we launched the Themes app or used the Storage Cleaner function within the Settings app, and there were ads in the Security app as well. Very few of these apps can be removed. Mi Music and Mi Video are also full of promotional content. There’s even spam in the Gallery app — sporadically, after playing a video clip we had recorded, we saw a screen of suggestions for Hungama videos. We were extremely disappointed to see how much advertising there was. Much of it only became apparent after a few days of use, so it's possible that there's even more, deeper beneath the surface, waiting to jump out at users. If this is the tradeoff for low-cost phones, we wouldn't be surprised to see even hardcore Xiaomi fans gravitating towards stock Android. That isn't to say that MIUI is all bad. It still has loads of features including Ui customisation options, the ability to clone apps, fine-grained display colour tone adjustment, useful gestures, and the ability to lock apps. There's face recognition, but Xiaomi warns that it might be defeated by a photo of you.  This is an entry-level phone, and we know that it isn't meant to be pushed too hard, but basic usage still needs to be smooth. Thankfully, we can say that the Redmi 6A — for the most part — was not frustrating to use. There was some lag when flipping through the task switcher or exiting from apps back to the home screen, but we could live with that. We also quickly learnt to avoid Xiaomi's Mi apps because the extra steps needed to dismiss ads all the time became too annoying. On rare occasions, it took a second or two for many apps, including the basic Messaging app, to be usable after loading. You can hide the on-screen Android navigation buttons and use gestures instead, but we found that to be extremely slow. The keyboard was also a bit of a problem, but Google's Gboard is preloaded and ready to go as an alternative. MIUI is strained with with only 2GB of RAM, and we noted anywhere between 650MB and 1.2GB free during use. The screen is good enough for watching videos and playing games on, and we had no major complaints in terms of vibrancy, colour reproduction, or viewing angles considering the price of this phone. The speaker on the back isn't very clear and music doesn't sound great, but voices in videos come through well enough. Benchmark tests gave us pretty decent results. We got 61,053 in AnTuTu, and 765 and 2,306 respectively in Geekbench's single-core and multi-core tests. The 20fps score in GFXBench's T-Rex test shows that 3D games won't run all that well, but you should be able to play casual puzzle titles without any trouble. 3DMark's Ice Storm Extreme test gave us a score of 5,451 and the Slingshot test score was 453. Xiaomi's phones have always surprised us with great performance in our HD video loop battery life test. The Redmi 6A ran for 13 hours, 22 minutes, thanks to its 3000mAh battery, the efficient SoC, and MIUI's optimisations. Our everyday usage consisted of a bit of light gaming and video streaming, and we comfortably made it through a 10-hour working day and the rest of the evening. If you don't use your phone for much more than calls, messages and social media, you should be able to stretch to a day and a half between charges.

2414,21,xiaomi-redmi-note-6-pro-review-1951381,8,10,2018-11-22,1951381,Aditya Shenoy,Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-note-6-pro-review-1951381," The Redmi Note 6 Pro is here and it has some big shoes to fill. Xiaomi's success has been built upon a simple formula: offer powerful hardware at aggressive prices to undercut the competition. One recent example of this strategy was the predecessor to the Redmi Note 6 Pro. With the Redmi Note 5 Pro, the Chinese manufacturer has been very hard to beat around the Rs. 15,000 price mark thanks to the use of the Snapdragon 636 SoC. The device has been extremely popular, so naturally, that increases the expectations we have from its successor, the Redmi Note 6 Pro. Xiaomi seems to be playing safe and has retained the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor. What is different now is that the Redmi Note 6 Pro gets a notched display and dual cameras on the front as well as the back. Can the new Redmi Note 6 Pro be as successful as the phone it replaces? We put it to the test to find out.    In terms of size, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro is roughly similar to its predecessor, the Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review). In fact, if you place the Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review), Redmi Note 5 Pro, and Redmi Note 6 Pro next to each other and face down, you won't be able to distinguish between them easily. The vertical dual camera setup protrudes slightly and does not let the phone rest flat when lying on any surface. The camera module also houses an LED flash. A metal backplate sits over the plastic frame of the smartphone. However, from the front, the Redmi Note 6 Pro stands out, primarily because it has a bigger display with a notch at the top. This notch is bigger than the one on the Redmi 6 Pro (Review), Xiaomi's first smartphone with a notch in India. Xiaomi has positioned the power and the volume buttons on the right. The power button is easy to hit, but the volume buttons need a bit of a stretch to reach. All buttons offer solid feedback. On the top, this phone has a 3.5mm headphone jack, a secondary microphone, and an IR emitter which can be used to control appliances . At the bottom, there's a Micro-USB port which is a little disappointing, considering that other phones in this price range such as the Nokia 6.1 Plus (Review) and the Motorola One Power (Review) sport USB Type-C ports. There are grilles on either side of the Micro-USB port but only the one on the right houses a loudspeaker. The left side of the phone is bare and only has the hybrid dual-SIM tray. Xiaomi has curved the back of the phone which make it comfortable to hold. The 182g weight is also masked well, and this phone does not feel uncomfortable to hold. If you are wondering about the weight, the Redmi Note 6 Pro is heavy because it packs in a 4000mAh battery. The notch on the Redmi Note 6 Pro houses the dual selfie cameras    Xiaomi has opted to go for the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor to power the Redmi Note 6 Pro. Why fix something that isn't broken, seems to be the theme here, as this is the same processor that powered the Redmi Note 5 Pro. You'll also find this SoC inside the Nokia 6.1 Plus, Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review), and Motorola One Power. This chip has eight Kryo 260 CPU cores clocked at 1.8GHz, split up as four ‘performance' cores and four ‘efficiency' cores. The Redmi Note 6 Pro comes in two variants, one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, and the other with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Our review unit was the latter. You do get the option to expand storage using the hybrid dual-SIM tray but at the cost of a second SIM. While 64GB of internal storage should suffice for many people, a dedicated microSD card slot would've helped. There is support for dual 4G as well as dual VoLTE. Other connectivity options on the Redmi Note 6 Pro include Bluetooth 5, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, GPS, and FM Radio. It also has a Wi-Fi passthrough feature that lets the phone act as a Wi-Fi repeater. We connected the Redmi Note 6 Pro to our Wi-Fi access point as usual, and then connected a few other devices to the smartphone using its hotspot feature. It worked as advertised, and we could access the Internet through the Redmi Note 6 Pro. This phone also has support for Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 but Xiaomi only ships a 10W charger in the box. You can buy a quick charger separately to enable fast charging. Just like the Xiaomi Poco F1 (Review), the Redmi Note 6 Pro also gets a water-resistant P2i coating. Just like most other Xiaomi smartphones, the Redmi Note 6 Pro runs the company's custom MIUI skin. You get the latest version, i.e. MIUI 10, based on Android 8.1 Oreo. With the competition already pushing out updates to Android Pie, Xiaomi could have launched the Redmi Note 6 Pro with the latest version of the OS. Our review unit was running the October security patch which is fairly recent. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro has a hybrid dual-SIM tray    Xiaomi's custom UI has a few visual tweaks such as a new app switcher layout that looks fresh. You still don't get an app drawer, and all app icons appear on the home screens when installed. Like most other smartphones with notches, you have the option to mask the notch with a black band. You also get theme support so you can customise the look of the smartphone. Xiaomi preinstalls quite a number of apps including Google's entire suite, Mi Drop, Cleaner, UC Browser, Mi Remote, Mi Store, Mi Community, Amazon Shopping, Facebook, NewsPoint, and Dailyhunt plus a few others. During our review period, we had Dailyhunt and Mi Video constantly spamming us with notifications. A swipe to the right from the first homescreen gives you card-style updates, shortcuts for apps, and widgets for things like stock prices, and checking train PNR numbers. There's even a panel for Ola that opens the app if installed or redirects you to the company's webpage to let you call for a cab. You also get calendar reminders here and shortcuts for Swiggy, Redbus, and BigBasket. We found ads in apps including Mi Music and Mi Video, which got really annoying. (Take a look at our tutorial on how to get rid of these ads permanently). There are gesture shortcuts on the Redmi Note 6 Pro which let you take a screenshot or launch the camera app. You also get the option to switch to fullscreen gestures instead of the on-screen Android navigation buttons. We found a new Enterprise mode that, from the looks of it, lets you create a separate enterprise profile. The Redmi Note 6 Pro shows you a list of fullscreen-compatible apps and gives you the option to force non-compatible apps to run in fullscreen mode. Our Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro ran perfectly without any lag or stutter, which might have been helped by the 6GB of RAM in our device. It could multitasking easily without having to kill apps in the background. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 isn't an old processor and is capable of running most apps and new game titles. We played PUBG Mobile which ran at the lowest settings, but managed to deliver a playable experience without any stutter. The phone did get slightly warm to the touch after playing the game for a while. We ran a few benchmarks on the device to gauge performance and the scores were not significantly different than those of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro. In AnTuTu, the Redmi Note 6 Pro managed 115,880, and it also scored 1,326 and 4,866 in Geekbench 4's single-core and multi-core tests. The phone managed 34fps and 9.7fps in the T-Rex and Manhattan 3.1 tests respectively in GFXBench. In 3DMark, it scored 946 in Slingshot Extreme OpenGL. The 12-megapixel + 5-megapixel dual camera setup    The battery capacity has remained unchanged for the Redmi Note 6 Pro as well, and in our HD video loop test, the phone went on for 15 hours and 36 minutes. This is exactly an hour less than the Redmi Note 5 Pro, which could be attributed to the slightly larger and brighter display. With our usage, which consisted of an active WhatsApp account, over 2 hours of navigation using Google Maps, and about 25 minutes of PUBG Mobile, the Redmi Note 6 Pro lasted us for over a day without any issues. If your usage isn't as heavy as ours, the phone should be able to last longer. Xiaomi has retained the 12-megapixel + 5-megapixel rear camera configuration from the Redmi Note 5 Pro. The 12-megapixel sensor, however, is new, and has a 1.4 micron pixel size and dual-pixel autofocus. It has an f/1.9 aperture which should help it pull in more light compared to the Redmi Note 5 Pro, which had an f/2.2 aperture. The secondary 5-megapixel depth sensor is used when taking portrait shots with a depth effect. At the front, this phone also has a 20-megapixel selfie camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. The primary sensor here uses a 4-in-1 pixel binning method to have an effective pixel size of 1.8 microns. AI is the buzzword nowadays, and Xiaomi claims that AI scene detection is built into the camera app on the Redmi Note 6 Pro. As per Xiaomi, the rear cameras are capable of recognizing 32 scenes, while the selfie camera can recognise 12 scenes using AI. The camera app is similar to what we have seen on most Xiaomi phones, with the addition being an AI toggle for both the primary and selfie cameras. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro camera samples   Landscape shots had decent details and the phone managed to get the exposure right. If you zoom in at 100 percent you will see some loss in detail. Auto HDR is available and kicks in automatically when required. The Redmi Note 6 Pro did manage to surprise us when taking macros. It managed good separation between the subject and the background. We also put the AI camera feature to the test, and found that the phone could detect what it was pointed towards. When shooting portraits, the phone managed good edge detection. Once a shot is taken, you get the options to adjust the level of blur, add light trails, and adjust studio lighting. We found that the edge detection while using studio lighting isn't consistent. In low light, the phone lowers the shutter speed to capture more light so you might notice some blurring if your subject is moving. When you don't have a light source nearby, the photos aren't as sharp and lack a lot of detail. Selfies taken with the Redmi Note 6 Pro had good details, and Auto HDR also kicks in if required. You have the option to enable beautification which smoothens the output. An advanced mode that lets you fine-tune different parameters for beautification. We liked the edge detection in portraits taken with the selfie camera. Video recording on the Redmi Note 6 Pro maxes out at 1080p which is disappointing, considering that other smartphones in this price range are capable of 4K video recording. There is EIS to stabilise footage but it causes a shimmering effect in videos. Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro in pictures VerdictThe Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro is the successor to the Redmi Note 5 Pro and has a few upgrades over the model it replaces. The notched display on the Redmi Note 6 Pro is bigger and brighter, and the cameras have also been upgraded, which does result in better output. Xiaomi has improved slightly on a product that was already good, and the refresh was necessary because competition has now caught up with Xiaomi, in the form of the Nokia 6.1 Plus (Review) and Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review). Xiaomi recently dropped the prices of the two Redmi Note 5 Pro variants to Rs. 13,999 and Rs. 15,999, which are exactly the same as the Redmi Note 6 Pro's launch prices. While the older phone is still currently available, the Redmi Note 6 Pro is clearly the better choice. Ads have been an issue with MIUI for a while, but things are now at a stage where they are starting to impact even basic day to day usage. Combine it with the fact that MIUI 10 on the Redmi Note 6 Pro is based on Android 8.1 Oreo, and you have a software experience that lags behind the competition. Xiaomi's aggressive pricing gives the base variant of this new phone a good chance against the current lineup of best phones under Rs. 15,000. However, the higher-specced version of the Redmi Note 6 Pro is priced at Rs 15,999, which is closer to the Xiaomi Mi A2 (which runs stock Android), and squarely against the Realme 2 Pro (Review). Both those models use the more powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 SoC. There's also the Motorola One Power (Review) with its 5000mAh battery to consider. That means that while the base variant of the Redmi Note 6 Pro is a good deal, there are better options available if you are looking at the higher-end variant. Can Redmi Note 6 Pro beat the Nokia 6.1 Plus and Zenfone Max Pro M1?

This chip has eight Kryo 260 CPU cores clocked at 1.8GHz, split up as four ‘performance' cores and four ‘efficiency' cores. The Redmi Note 6 Pro comes in two variants, one with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, and the other with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. Our review unit was the latter. You do get the option to expand storage using the hybrid dual-SIM tray but at the cost of a second SIM. While 64GB of internal storage should suffice for many people, a dedicated microSD card slot would've helped. There is support for dual 4G as well as dual VoLTE. Other connectivity options on the Redmi Note 6 Pro include Bluetooth 5, dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, GPS, and FM Radio. It also has a Wi-Fi passthrough feature that lets the phone act as a Wi-Fi repeater. We connected the Redmi Note 6 Pro to our Wi-Fi access point as usual, and then connected a few other devices to the smartphone using its hotspot feature. It worked as advertised, and we could access the Internet through the Redmi Note 6 Pro. This phone also has support for Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 but Xiaomi only ships a 10W charger in the box. You can buy a quick charger separately to enable fast charging. Just like the Xiaomi Poco F1 (Review), the Redmi Note 6 Pro also gets a water-resistant P2i coating. Just like most other Xiaomi smartphones, the Redmi Note 6 Pro runs the company's custom MIUI skin. You get the latest version, i.e. MIUI 10, based on Android 8.1 Oreo. With the competition already pushing out updates to Android Pie, Xiaomi could have launched the Redmi Note 6 Pro with the latest version of the OS. Our review unit was running the October security patch which is fairly recent. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro has a hybrid dual-SIM tray    Xiaomi's custom UI has a few visual tweaks such as a new app switcher layout that looks fresh. You still don't get an app drawer, and all app icons appear on the home screens when installed. Like most other smartphones with notches, you have the option to mask the notch with a black band. You also get theme support so you can customise the look of the smartphone. Xiaomi preinstalls quite a number of apps including Google's entire suite, Mi Drop, Cleaner, UC Browser, Mi Remote, Mi Store, Mi Community, Amazon Shopping, Facebook, NewsPoint, and Dailyhunt plus a few others. During our review period, we had Dailyhunt and Mi Video constantly spamming us with notifications. A swipe to the right from the first homescreen gives you card-style updates, shortcuts for apps, and widgets for things like stock prices, and checking train PNR numbers. There's even a panel for Ola that opens the app if installed or redirects you to the company's webpage to let you call for a cab. You also get calendar reminders here and shortcuts for Swiggy, Redbus, and BigBasket. We found ads in apps including Mi Music and Mi Video, which got really annoying. (Take a look at our tutorial on how to get rid of these ads permanently). There are gesture shortcuts on the Redmi Note 6 Pro which let you take a screenshot or launch the camera app. You also get the option to switch to fullscreen gestures instead of the on-screen Android navigation buttons. We found a new Enterprise mode that, from the looks of it, lets you create a separate enterprise profile. The Redmi Note 6 Pro shows you a list of fullscreen-compatible apps and gives you the option to force non-compatible apps to run in fullscreen mode. Our Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro ran perfectly without any lag or stutter, which might have been helped by the 6GB of RAM in our device. It could multitasking easily without having to kill apps in the background. The Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 isn't an old processor and is capable of running most apps and new game titles. We played PUBG Mobile which ran at the lowest settings, but managed to deliver a playable experience without any stutter. The phone did get slightly warm to the touch after playing the game for a while. We ran a few benchmarks on the device to gauge performance and the scores were not significantly different than those of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro. In AnTuTu, the Redmi Note 6 Pro managed 115,880, and it also scored 1,326 and 4,866 in Geekbench 4's single-core and multi-core tests. The phone managed 34fps and 9.7fps in the T-Rex and Manhattan 3.1 tests respectively in GFXBench. In 3DMark, it scored 946 in Slingshot Extreme OpenGL. The 12-megapixel + 5-megapixel dual camera setup    The battery capacity has remained unchanged for the Redmi Note 6 Pro as well, and in our HD video loop test, the phone went on for 15 hours and 36 minutes. This is exactly an hour less than the Redmi Note 5 Pro, which could be attributed to the slightly larger and brighter display. With our usage, which consisted of an active WhatsApp account, over 2 hours of navigation using Google Maps, and about 25 minutes of PUBG Mobile, the Redmi Note 6 Pro lasted us for over a day without any issues. If your usage isn't as heavy as ours, the phone should be able to last longer. Xiaomi has retained the 12-megapixel + 5-megapixel rear camera configuration from the Redmi Note 5 Pro. The 12-megapixel sensor, however, is new, and has a 1.4 micron pixel size and dual-pixel autofocus. It has an f/1.9 aperture which should help it pull in more light compared to the Redmi Note 5 Pro, which had an f/2.2 aperture. The secondary 5-megapixel depth sensor is used when taking portrait shots with a depth effect. At the front, this phone also has a 20-megapixel selfie camera and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. The primary sensor here uses a 4-in-1 pixel binning method to have an effective pixel size of 1.8 microns. AI is the buzzword nowadays, and Xiaomi claims that AI scene detection is built into the camera app on the Redmi Note 6 Pro. As per Xiaomi, the rear cameras are capable of recognizing 32 scenes, while the selfie camera can recognise 12 scenes using AI. The camera app is similar to what we have seen on most Xiaomi phones, with the addition being an AI toggle for both the primary and selfie cameras. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro camera samples   Landscape shots had decent details and the phone managed to get the exposure right. If you zoom in at 100 percent you will see some loss in detail. Auto HDR is available and kicks in automatically when required. The Redmi Note 6 Pro did manage to surprise us when taking macros. It managed good separation between the subject and the background. We also put the AI camera feature to the test, and found that the phone could detect what it was pointed towards. When shooting portraits, the phone managed good edge detection. Once a shot is taken, you get the options to adjust the level of blur, add light trails, and adjust studio lighting. We found that the edge detection while using studio lighting isn't consistent. In low light, the phone lowers the shutter speed to capture more light so you might notice some blurring if your subject is moving. When you don't have a light source nearby, the photos aren't as sharp and lack a lot of detail. Selfies taken with the Redmi Note 6 Pro had good details, and Auto HDR also kicks in if required. You have the option to enable beautification which smoothens the output. An advanced mode that lets you fine-tune different parameters for beautification. We liked the edge detection in portraits taken with the selfie camera. Video recording on the Redmi Note 6 Pro maxes out at 1080p which is disappointing, considering that other smartphones in this price range are capable of 4K video recording. There is EIS to stabilise footage but it causes a shimmering effect in videos. Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro in pictures VerdictThe Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro is the successor to the Redmi Note 5 Pro and has a few upgrades over the model it replaces. The notched display on the Redmi Note 6 Pro is bigger and brighter, and the cameras have also been upgraded, which does result in better output. Xiaomi has improved slightly on a product that was already good, and the refresh was necessary because competition has now caught up with Xiaomi, in the form of the Nokia 6.1 Plus (Review) and Asus ZenFone Max Pro M1 (Review). Xiaomi recently dropped the prices of the two Redmi Note 5 Pro variants to Rs. 13,999 and Rs. 15,999, which are exactly the same as the Redmi Note 6 Pro's launch prices. While the older phone is still currently available, the Redmi Note 6 Pro is clearly the better choice. Ads have been an issue with MIUI for a while, but things are now at a stage where they are starting to impact even basic day to day usage. Combine it with the fact that MIUI 10 on the Redmi Note 6 Pro is based on Android 8.1 Oreo, and you have a software experience that lags behind the competition. Xiaomi's aggressive pricing gives the base variant of this new phone a good chance against the current lineup of best phones under Rs. 15,000. However, the higher-specced version of the Redmi Note 6 Pro is priced at Rs 15,999, which is closer to the Xiaomi Mi A2 (which runs stock Android), and squarely against the Realme 2 Pro (Review). Both those models use the more powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 SoC. There's also the Motorola One Power (Review) with its 5000mAh battery to consider. That means that while the base variant of the Redmi Note 6 Pro is a good deal, there are better options available if you are looking at the higher-end variant. Can Redmi Note 6 Pro beat the Nokia 6.1 Plus and Zenfone Max Pro M1?

2419,21,xiaomi-redmi-y2-review-1863505,7,10,2018-06-12,1863505,Aditya Shenoy,Xiaomi Redmi Y2 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-y2-review-1863505," Some people are obsessed with selfies and phone manufacturers have taken notice. The result is smartphones dedicated to selfies. We have seen manufacturers like Oppo claiming to be the ""Selfie Expert"", while others have specific selfie-focused models. One such manufacturer is Xiaomi, which launched the Redmi Y1 (Review) and the Redmi Y1 Lite last year. To keep up with the times, Xiaomi has created a successor to it called the Redmi Y2. With improved internals, is the Redmi Y2 the smartphone to buy for good selfies on a budget? We find out    Take a look at the Redmi Y2 and you will see that the design has evolved. It looks a lot like the Redmi S2, which the company recently launched in the Chinese market. It has a 5.99-inch display and a Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro (Review)-like camera module at the back. The Redmi Y2 is primarily made of plastic, unlike the Redmi Note series which uses metal in its construction. The Redmi Y2 is tall and narrow thanks to the 18:9 aspect ratio. The display has rounded corners, just like other recent Xiaomi phones. Above the display is a recessed metal earpiece, a selfie camera, and a selfie light. This phone is comfortable to hold thanks to its curved sides and rounded edges. However, it isn't easy to reach the top of the display without shuffling the phone in your hand.    Button placement on the Redmi Y2 is good, and it is easy to click the power and the volume buttons that are positioned on the right. The phone has a Micro-USB port at the bottom with grilles on either side, but only the right one houses a loudspeaker. The 3.5mm headphone jack, an IR emitter, and a secondary microphone are on the top. Turn the phone around and you will see a dual camera setup and a fingerprint scanner that is conveniently placed. Xiaomi has also opted for antenna lines that run along the top and the bottom of the phone. The Redmi Y2 weighs 170g and measures 8.1mm in thickness. It has a 3080mAh non-removable battery that Xiaomi claims can deliver all-day battery life. The phone does ship with a 10W charger in the box but there is no mention of quick charging support. Like other Xiaomi smartphones, the retail box for the Redmi Y2 only contains the phone, charger, Micro-USB cable, and a case. Xiaomi is known to offer good hardware with most of its smartphones and the Redmi Y2 isn't an exception. The Redmi Y2 is powered by the Snapdragon 625 SoC, which is an octa-core processor clocked at 2.0GHz. There are two variants of the phone, one with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, and the other with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. It has a dedicated microSD card slot and you can use a card of up to 256GB capacity.    The 5.99-inch display sports an HD+ resolution of 720x1440 pixels and an 18:9 aspect ratio, which is a marginal upgrade over the Redmi Y1. The display has decent viewing angles and a neutral colour output, but you do have the option to tweak that as per your preference. The screen is slightly reflective and isn't clearly legible when outdoors. The Redmi Y2 is a dual-SIM device with two Nano-SIM slots, and has a non-removable 3080mAh battery. There is support for WiFi 802.11b/g/n, Bluetooth, GPS, 4G, and VoLTE. The dual camera setup on the back of Redmi Y2 consists of a 12-megapixel primary camera and a 5-megapixel secondary camera. Xiaomi has gone with a 16-megapixel selfie camera along with a selfie light, which should help it capture better photos in poorly lit environments. MIUI 9.5 is Xiaomi's custom UI running on the Redmi Y2 on top of Android 8.1 Oreo, and our unit had received the May 2018 security patch. It has all of Xiaomi's UI customisations such as Second Space, Dual Apps, and theme support, which we have seen on older devices. You can swipe right from the homescreen to access quick shortcuts and other widgets. The company has made a few tweaks to the navigation buttons and you now have the option to ditch them and use gesture navigation. Once enabled, you can swipe up from the bottom of the screen and release to go to the home screen, or pause to open the app switcher. An inward swipe from the lower left or right edge of the screen is required to go back.    Following the current trend, Xiaomi has added face reognition as one of the methods to unlock the phone. The setup process seems very basic and it did not ask us to look to the right or left in order to capture multiple angles. In fact, a message appeared while setting up Face Unlock, stating that the device can potentially be unlocked by other people using a photo of you. After setting it up, we did use it to unlock the phone and found it to be slower and not as accurate as other manufacturers' implementations. Looking at this performance and the time it takes to unlock the phone, we would recommend that you stick to the fingerprint sensor. Xiaomi has installed a few apps in addition to the usual set of Mi Apps that we are now used to. You get a few Google apps preinstalled, along with Facebook, Amazon, PhonePe, Netflix, and NewsPoint. While storage isn't a major constraint as you get close to 22GB of free space with the 32GB variant, you can still go ahead and uninstall most of these apps. The Snapdragon 625 SoC is a tried and tested processor and has been around for a while, even powering some of Xiaomi's previous models. It is still capable of delivering a good lag-free experience, and we did not notice any stutter during usage. It manages multitasking quite well, and we found that the phone did keep apps in the background, making it easy for us to switch between them. We had the 3GB RAM variant in for review, which delivered decent results when we benchmarked it. In AnTuTu, it managed to score 77,089, and also 823 and 3982 in Geekbench's single-core and multi-core tests respectively. It scored 851 in 3DMark Slingshot, and 35fps in GFXBench T-Rex. These scores are quite similar to those of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5, except for marginally better performance in graphics benchmarks owing to the lower-resolution display. Battery performance depends hugely on what you are doing with the Redmi Y2. With our light usage restricted to social media apps like Facebook and WhatsApp, coupled with a few calls, this phone managed to get through one day without needing to be plugged it. Bump the usage up to include games, and you will see that the battery level drops quicker. While playing games like Clash Royale we saw a high rate of battery drain. On the other hand, our HD video loop test ran for 14 hours and 46 minutes. When you run out of power, the supplied 10W charger takes close to two hours to top the phone up completely. Xiaomi's camera app is fairly straightforward and easy to use. You get a few quick toggles for HDR and the flash, and an option to apply filters to your photos. Other camera modes include Short Video which lets you record 10-second clips, the usual video mode, Portrait mode, and a Manual mode that only lets you control the white balance and ISO. Panorama mode only lets you take photos while holding the phone in portrait. We noticed a slight shutter lag which became more of an issue in low light. When you switch to the selfie camera you do get to choose the level of beautification you like, and there's an advanced mode that gives you control over specific parameters such as the eyes, jawline, skin tone, and skin smoothening. Xiaomi says that it uses AI to apply beautification to photo subjects. Tap to see full-sized Xiaomi Redmi Y2 camera samples Selfies are the highlight of the Redmi Y2, and it does a good job here. It can recognise more than one face and apply the necessary beautification enhancements. We saw that the phone tended to slightly overexpose shots taken outdoors. In dim environments, the selfie light springs into action to let you get a better shot. Since it is diffused, it doesn't hurt the eyes. Photos taken with the rear camera were decent in daylight, and we were satisfied with the output it delivered. Landscape shots had a good amount of detail, and the Y2 managed to capture colours rather well. With macros, you'll need to put in a little work to get the camera to focus where you want. Once it locks focus, this phone does a good job, and shots do appear sharp. We tried the portrait mode which uses the secondary camera to simulate a depth-of-field effect. Switching to portrait mode results in a bit of cropping with the primary sensor. The live view for portrait mode is a little slow to show previews of the effect, and the phone takes some time to process a portrait shot. The results depend on the distance between the subject and background, and any object near the subject will cause issues with edge detection. When the scene is relatively simple, the Y2 does manage to deliver a good usable result. Low-light shots need a steady hand, as the camera reduces its shutter speed to capture more light. We noticed that it also loses out on details in landscape shots resulting in a patchy effect when zooming in on a few of our samples. Video recording maxes out at 1080p for the rear camera, and EIS does help you capture fairly steady footage. Xiaomi Redmi Y2 in pictures   VerdictThe Xiaomi Redmi Y2 is a slightly better attempt at a selfie-focused smartphone than the model it replaces. It has proven hardware that is capable of delivering a smooth user experience, plus MIUI 9.5 which has a lot of added features. The camera performance is good in daylight but goes down a little in low light. Selfies are the highlight of this smartphone and it does deliver on that front, with good shots in various lighting conditions. For its asking price, the Redmi Y2 could be a good choice if you prioritise selfies over everything else. If you want a better all-rounder, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 (Review) has a full HD+ display, a bigger 4000mAh battery, and sells at same price. Another alternative is the Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1 (Review), which costs a little extra but also delivers more in terms of specifications.
