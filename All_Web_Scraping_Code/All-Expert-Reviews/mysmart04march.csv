0,By Rahul Srinivas -  ,NA,NA,"Sep 4, 2018"," I have been writing about technology and reviewing smartphones for over 10 years now. Over the years, I thought I had gotten used to the scary pace at which the mobile phones space evolved. However, what has transpired over the course of the past few months in the Indian smartphones space – especially the rate at which prices seem to fall has been quite astonishing – even for a (self-professed) industry veteran like me. Things started off with ASUS making its intentions clear by undercutting XiaomiÂ in the affordable segment with its impressive Zenfone Max Pro (M1). This was followed by their assault on the affordable flagship segment with the brilliant pricing for the Zenfone 5Z. Not to be left behind, Huawei-owned Honor decided to jump onto the bandwagon and came up with the device we are reviewing today – the Honor Play. Xiaomi, however, had the last laugh after they announced a new phone (and along with it, a new sub-brand), the Poco F1 that I have started reviewing already. Anyway, let us now talk about the Honor Play in detail. I will start off by listing out the stuff you will get inside the retail box of the device.  The Honor Play unit that we received for review was the standard black variant that honestly did not look very striking. In this colour, the handset looked very similar to older Honor devices like the Honor 7X and the Honor 9i. That being said, as far as dimensions and looks go, the Honor Play closely resembles the Nova 3i – minus the dazzling colour options. Anyway, I have talked in detail about the design and build quality aspects of the Nova 3 in another article. Please click the link below to read the same. Honor Play Review: Design and Build Honor Play Review: Display  The Honor Play, like most mid-range and high-end handsets that are on sale today, features a prominent notch at the top. The display used by the handset is identical to the one we saw on the Nova 3 and measured 6.3-inches across and has a resolution of 1080 x 2340 pixels in the 19.5:9 aspect ratio. As you might have already guessed, this happens to be an IPS LCD panel with good viewing angles and near accurate colours. In case you want to read in detail about the display, I have talked about the same in detail in a separate article. You can click the link below to read that article. Honor Play: How Good Is the Notched Display on This Phone?  The Honor Play is powered by Huaweiâs flagship grade Kirin 970 chip that is also found doing duty on devices like the P20 Pro and the Nova 3. The phone is offered in two versions – a base 4GB RAM +64GB version that we had with us, and a pricier 6GB RAM + 64GB version. As for the software, like all Huawei and Honor devices, the phone runs EMUI 8.2 which is based on Android 8.1. Since I have been using Honor devices for a long time now, I am used to the UI and I am pretty sure you will get used to it as well in a couple of days. During my time with the device, I did not notice any major issues with the performance aspects of the device. Thanks to the flagship grade chip, the gaming-centric Honor Play is more than capable of handling any game you throw at it. In fact, we also did a speed test of the Honor Play against the Mi A2 and the Honor Play fared pretty well. The phone also boasts of a much talked about GPU turbo mode that claims to improve gaming performance without adversely affecting battery life. I have written in detail about these and other aspects of the device in a separate article that you can read by clicking the link below. Honor Play Performance, Software: No Compromise Gaming On a Budget  While not targeted as a camera-centric, the Honor Play does tote surprisingly good cameras. The primary camera setup of the phone includes a 16-megapixel shooter mated to a 2-megapixel depth sensor. At the front, there is a 16-megapixel fixed focus shooter capable of decent selfies – albeit under good lighting conditions. The Honor Play also features several AI modes for the camera. These modes detect the ambient lighting and other conditions and fine-tune the image to suit that environment. As far as video capabilities are concerned, the Honor Play is capable of recording 4K videos at 30fps in the highest settings. 1080p 60fps videos are also supported. The front camera, however, is restricted to videos in 720p resolution which I feel is a major drawback. Also, the slow-motion capabilities on the phone lags behind when you look at what the competition has on offer. Read more about the imaging capabilities of the Honor Play in our detailed separate article. Click the link below. Honor Play: Could a Gaming Phone Also Double Up As a Great Cameraphone?  There is no doubt that the Honor Play is currently among the best smartphones you could buy in the Rs. 15,000 – Rs. 20,000 segment. Most users should choose the 4GB version of the device which in my opinion is capable of handling most things you throw at it. The phone offers flagship performance at an unbelievable price and has a well-rounded feature-set that ticks almost all the right boxes. The performance is zippy, the camera is good – except for underwhelming low-light performance. Save for the underwhelming camera, there is hardly anything that I can think of that goes against the Honor Play. In fact, this would have been my recommendation in case you had a Rs. 15-16k budget for a smartphone and could increase it slightly. However, there is a new contender in town that threatens even the highly capable Honor Play. This device is the Poco F1 from Xiaomi that offers better hardware for a slightly higher price tag for its base version. It is up to you, however, to decide if you are willing to pay the marginal Rs. 1,000 premium for this increase in performance. I would say your extra Rs. 1,000 will be totally worth it.

1,By Awad Ballaith -  ,NA,NA,"Sep 25, 2018"," HMD Global has been noticeably vocal regarding its plans to focus on the budget segment of the smartphone market. As a part of this effort, the Finnish company launched the Nokia 6.1 Plus, a device we were first introduced to when it came out as the Nokia X6 in China earlier this year. The phone offers admittedly mid-ranged specifications relative to its price tag of Rs. 15,999 in India. Android purists will also appreciate the fact this is an Android One device that offers a stock build of Android 8.1. With this combination, the Nokia phone happens to compete with the likes of the Xiaomi Mi A2, Redmi Note 5 Pro and Asus Zenfone Max Pro M1. Can the Nokia 6.1 Plus offer better value than its competition? Read ahead to find out. I used the Black variant of the Nokia 6.1 Plus for about two weeks to properly assess how the phone stands on its own. While the device does offer a dual-SIM hybrid slot, I used it in a single SIM setup on a Vodafone network in Hyderabad. My usual setup is comprised of 3 email accounts running alongside the usual collection of social media and messaging apps such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Slack and so on. The device only offers a fingerprint scanner for biometric unlock, which I used as my primary unlocking method for the duration of this review. The 64GB of internal storage was also adequate during this time that I did not feel the need to use a microSD card. Nokia has acquired a reputation for building sturdy handsets. The Nokia 6.1 Plus is no exception and is certainly a marvel to look at. This is partly thanks to its large 5.8-inch screen that covers 81.5% of the front of the device. Then we have the sleek and glossy back that neatly houses the Nokia moniker, fingerprint scanner and vertically mounted rear camera in a straight line. Even with its predominantly glass construction wrapped around a smooth metal frame, the phone was easily able to survive a few drops now and then. However, there were a few scratches by the end of my time with the device. A standard case might be a worthwhile investment. The bottom is where we find a USB Type-C charging port just beside the bottom firing speaker. The right side is comprised of the power button and volume rockers. Both provide adequate tactile feedback while still being recessed enough so as not to cause any discomfort while holding the device. Moving over to the left reveals a hybrid SIM slot. This is said to support up to 400GB of additional storage with a microSD as long as you are willing to sacrifice the second SIM card. Thankfully, we donât have to say goodbye to the 3.5mm headphone jack just yet as the Nokia 6.1 Plus houses one at the top. Overall, the deviceâs relatively short demeanour ends up being a godsend in this day and age of unusually tall phones. I had no issues in holding and using the device with just one hand most of the time. While there are certainly noticeable bezels at the sides along with a sizeable chin at the bottom, these end up helping with the ergonomics and prevent any phantom touches. The only real complaint I had with the overall design of the device is in the placement of the fingerprint scanner as it is located too low. The index finger doesnât naturally fall there and needs to be bent each time the phones needs to be unlocked.  In my time with the Nokia 6.1 Plus, I was pleasantly impressed with the phoneâs display. All in all, we get a 5.8-inch IPS LCD panel that sports a 1080 x 2280 pixels resolution, stretching the aspect ratio up to 19:9. No matter how you feel about the notch, there is no denying how refreshing it is to hold and use a bezel-less handset from Nokia for the first time. Content in full screen is unlikely to be obstructed anyway as the OS ends up adding a black bar on either side of this notch. While standard 16:9 aspect ratio videos do admittedly suffer when zoomed-in by having their tops and bottoms cut off, many movies and YouTube videos now come in wider aspect ratios that fit in very well. When it comes down to the actual quality of the Nokia 6.1 Plusâs screen, the LCD panel used here is one of the best you can find even on pricier offerings. This display is capable of exceptional white and black levels without any discernible noise. Colour reproduction is also surprisingly good across the entire spectrum. All this results in reasonably accurate colour reproduction along with sharp and detailed outputs. Being stock Android, you also get a modest array of customisation options for the display. These include adaptive brightness, night light, and the ability to adjust the font size and display element size. Furthermore, the phone offers âtap to wakeâ along with âambient displayâ. The latter feature especially comes in handy considering this device doesnât have a notification LED. Finally, the display also offers a colour correction option for those who may suffer from one of the three main types of colour blindness (Deuteranomaly, Protanomaly, Tritanomaly).  The primary USP of pretty much all modern Nokia smartphones is the fact that they are part of Googleâs Android One initiative. This results in the Nokia 6.1 Plus offering a clean and bloatware-free Android 8.1 Oreo OS running out-of-the-box. Using stock Android on this device is certainly an enjoyable experience. If you are accustomed to using heavily modified Operating Systems from other manufacturers, then the experience will undeniably feel barebones. But in this scenario, this is meant to be a good thing. The UI on the Nokia 6.1 Plus is similar to that found on Pixel devices. The notification bar and app drawer switch between dark or light themes depending on the type of wallpaper used. You do not get the option to toggle between the two. Furthermore, there arenât any unnecessary apps to deal with, and the standard collection of Google apps should suffice for getting started. Nokia does provide one additional app called ‘Support’ that lets you monitor your deviceâs health, go through a user guide, check warranty related details, and even locate a care centre nearby. The actual experience of using an untampered ecosystem is meant to be liberating in the sense that users get to enjoy applications for what they are without having to contend with OS-related distractions. While the Nokia 6.1 Plus certainly exceeds in this regard, there are still some aspects of the UI that donât exactly contribute to a seamless experience. One such issue, for example, is where applications in full-screen add a black bar on either side of the notch so as not to be obstructed by it, but the edges where the frame cuts off are straight while the base of the display is rounded. Then there is the recent âNotch Gateâ fiasco where during the entirety of this review, I wasnât able to black out the notch. While not a major issue for me personally, I understand the frustration of having the choice taken away.  The Nokia 6.1 Plus is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 SoC which is paired with 4GB of RAM. This chipset is quite capable of handling pretty much all of your daily tasks. Everything from unlocking the display to switching between apps is fairly smooth, with the RAM being sufficient for a good amount of multitasking. The lightweight operating system also ensures optimum utilisation of system resources. This can be felt while using and moving between the standard array of multimedia and social networking applications. Even the gaming performance was acceptable given the mid-range nature of this processor. Games such as PUBG and Modern Combat are certainly playable, as long as you are on lower graphics settings. Asphalt 9 fared a bit better with the graphics turned up, but a loss in frame rate was noticeable. On the other hand, less demanding titles such as Altoâs Odyssey perform marvellously. However, it is worth mentioning that the phone has heating issues which especially manifested while running demanding games. PUBG specifically caused the top half of the rear of the phone to get uncomfortably toasty. While the hardware limitations of the Snapdragon 636 are understandable, there are other performance inconstancies that are likely a result of the aforementioned poor software optimisation. An instance of this can be noticed when swiping down on the notification shade and being greeted with noticeable jittering. It became evident that this was an issue with the software and not the chipset when I turned on the âswipe fingerprint for notificationâ feature, which resulted in near-perfect animation fluidity. Moving on, the fingerprint scanner itself functions very well. Registering a fingerprint on this device is one of the fastest I have experienced, with the detection being just as good. Furthermore, the bottom firing speaker is also one of the better ones I have come across. It gets reasonably loud without any noticeable distortions at max volume. There is a lack of base which doesnât make this speaker ideal for music, but vocals from sources such YouTube videos are surprisingly clear and distinct. The headphone jack at the top of the device also functions as good as one would expect. Other than the âswipe fingerprint for notificationsâ feature mentioned above, other gesture-based actions can be performed on the Nokia 6.1 Plus as well. There is the option to turn the device over to reject calls. Another feature automatically mutes the ringtone when lifting the phone to an upright position. Double pressing the power button from any screen can be assigned to trigger the camera app. Finally, there is the option to trigger ambient display each time the device is picked up.  Getting to the photography aspect of this review, we begin by taking a look at the dual rear camera setup. The primary lens measures 16MP with an f/2.0 aperture, which is paired with a 5MP depth-sensing camera with an f/2.4 aperture. This setup is capable of 4K video recording at a maximum of 30fps. While it does not offer OIS, you do get auto-HDR functionality along with dual-tone LED flash. On the other hand, a 16MP camera is provided at the front for handling selfies. Both cameras offer AI-assisted portrait modes (Bokeh). It isnât entirely certain why Nokia decided to replace Androidâs stock camera app with its own. This isnât to say that its bad, as all the main options you need are right there at the forefront. A bar at the top houses toggles for flash, HDR, timer and beauty mode. There is also the option to enable both cameras and take âBothieâ images in either a ‘Dual’ or ‘PIP’ mode. While I did not find these options particularly useful, I suppose they are nice to have for those who may want to use them. Also, the Panorama, Bokeh and Manual modes are hidden away in a menu at the top left of the viewfinder. I was impressed by the imaging prowess of the phoneâs rear camera setup considering the price bracket this device falls in. Images captured in daylight have surprisingly accurate colours and also seem to have a decent amount of detail. Zooming in on the images on a monitor reveals some loss in fine detail, but this is not going to be an issue for those intending to upload them on social media platforms. The Bokeh mode was also very good with acceptably accurate edge detection. The beauty mode on both cameras can be slightly excessive at its max setting but still does not make the image look overly artificial. Selfies taken from the 16MP rear camera of this phone are also just as good and detailed as the rear camera. The edge detection for Bokeh shots is also equally impressive. While not perfect, it gets surprisingly accurate results most of the time. Auto-HDR does come in handy on the front camera as much as it does on the rear. However, there were some instances where a weird halo effect was cast around the subjects in the frame. These were presumably a result of some issue with the HDR processing. When it comes to the low-light photography, the rear camera was not too bad either. While the images do lose a bit more clarity and detail, the noise reduction algorithm does a surprisingly good job. While I did notice some lens flare in such shots, they weren’t exceedingly bothersome considering the overall image quality. However, the front-facing camera fares much worse in this regard. The noise is noticeably more, and beauty mode fails to work most of the time. The screen flash was also not too impressive here. It is clear that imaging prowess of the Nokia 6.1 Plus is despite its inconsistencies in darker scenarios. However, it was the video capabilities of this camera that left me wanting for more. The device boasts 4K recording at 30FPS with its rear camera. Without the support for any sort of stabilisation at this resolution, videos are jittery and shaky at best. While 1080p video recording loses on the clarity, it offers gyro-assisted EIS that result in much more usable videos. Furthermore, there is the ability to record time-lapse and slow-motion videos. While the former can come in handy with a tripod, the video quality of the latter is abysmal and not worth using at all. Update: It was recently brought to my attention that the Nokia 6.1 Plus’s rear camera images end up with a yellow tinge when the flash is turned on. I hadn’t initially noticed this during my camera tests but I can now confirm that this certainly is a real issue which I was able to reproduce. While I still admire this camera’s overall performance, this issue does affect my final score.  Compared to theÂ Nokia 6.1, the new Nokia 6.1 Plus barely gets an upgrade in terms of its battery size. The older device came with a 3000mAh battery while the new one comes with a 3060mAh cell. With continuous heavy use, I was able to get close to 6 hours and 35 minutes of screen-on-time while only being able to get about 15 hours of standby time. Lighter usage was able to give me up to 35 hours of standby time, with the screen-on time taking a hit down to 5 hours. The latter result was when I had the âambient displayâ feature turned on, and disabling it gave me half an hour of more screen time. You do get the ability to automatically enable a battery saver mode which is meant to push the phones life by reducing the screen brightness and cutting down on the animations. You can set it to auto-enable when the battery reaches either 5% or 15%. There is also the ability to manage which applications take battery resources in the background. Regardless, the most this device can do is offer a 1.5 dayâs worth of use, and I ended up resorting to the practice of thoroughly using the device during the course of a single day and plugging it up every night while going to bed. Since charging is handled over the provided USB Type-C port with support for Quick Charge 3.0, it takes roughly two hours to entirely top up the battery after it has been completely drained.  The Nokia 6.1 Plus will be an excellent offering for those searching for a relatively well-balanced package. I appreciate Nokiaâs care with the build and aesthetics of this phone. The phone’s display is by far one of the best I have seen at this end of the market. It offers surprisingly good camera setups at both the front and the back. While the battery might not be that impressive, it is still manageable for a full dayâs worth of use. Even the overall performance of the device is commendable despite the plaguing software optimisation issues. Hopefully, these grievances can be resolved with the soon to arrive Android Pie update. When it comes to the competition, however, the Nokia 6.1 Plus is only Rs. 1,000 away from the Xiaomi Mi A2Â which also offers an Android One experience while being powered by a significantly faster Snapdragon 660 SoC. Furthermore, you have the option of going with the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 (Review) if you wanted the same Android One experience paired with the Snapdragon 636 performance starting at just Rs. 10,999. Even the 6GB RAM variant of this phone costs Rs. 1,000 less than the Nokia handset, comes with almost similarly performing cameras, and offers significantly better battery life. My advice for potential buyers would be to either wait for Nokia to drop the price of its handset or go for it during some promo campaign where you can grab it at a reasonable discount. At its current price, the above-mentioned offerings from ASUS and Xiaomi offer much better value. Awad handles gadget reviews and high priority stories for MySmartPrice.

2,By Rahul Srinivas -  ,NA,NA,"Sep 23, 2018"," A little over two months ago, when ASUS launched the Zenfone 5ZÂ (Review) in India, it became the first phone in quite a while to bring a flagship-grade Qualcomm processor below the psychologically important sub-Rs. 30K mark. However, competitors were quick enough to react. Huaweiâs sub-brand Honor, for example, responded by launching the competent Honor Play (Review) which had Huaweiâs flagship class chip the Kirin 970 chip on a device that was priced below Rs. 20,000. Just when you thought things couldn’t get any crazier, Xiaomi made its intentions clear by launching the POCO F1. The Poco F1 also marked the entry of a new sub-brand from the company: POCO.Â It wouldnât be erroneous to state that the POCO F1 literally stole the thunder from bothâASUS Zenfone 5Z and Honor Playâwhich, mind you, are also excellent smartphones for their respective prices.  In this review, we take a detailed look at the POCO F1. As was the case with most other reviewers in India, we received the top-of-the-line 256GB storage variant of the smartphone with 8GB of RAM and Kevlar back. The phone is also sold in three other versions; a base variant with 6GB RAM and 64GB of storage, an 8GB RAM variant with 128GB of storage, and the 8GB RAM variant with 256GB of storage (with non-Kevlar back panel).  The retail box of the POCO F1 is very unassuming to look at and prominently displays the POCO branding. One thing I noticed about the Indian retail packaging is that the brand is called âPOCOâ instead of âPOCOPHONEâ as the brand is referred to in international markets.Â Anyway, you get the following things inside the retail box.  Xiaomi seems to have taken a totally different approach to design the POCO F1. While most of the POCO F1âs competitors try hard to look premium, the F1 seems to make no tangible effort to achieve that. Even the most premium version (which we received for the review) features a Kevlar coating and distinct patterns at the rear. It still did not evoke a sense of premium-ness, though. As you might already be aware, there are four variants of the POCO F1 currently on sale. Except for the most expensive ‘Armoured Edition’ that gets a polycarbonate body and a Kevlar covered rear panel, all the other less expensive versions get by with a polycarbonate (read Plastic) body. That is not to say that the handset feels cheap and badly built. The volume rocker keys and the power button, for example, have a solid feel and seem built to last.  The front of the POCO F1 is dominated by the large, 6.3-inch IPS LCD panel. As the norm is with most mid-range and premium handsets, this is a notched display. The notch area is where you will find the 20-megapixel front-facing camera, the IR illuminator for face unlock, the proximity sensor, and the earpiece (that also doubles up as a loudspeaker in the stereo mode). Keeping with the current trend, the display has curved edges. However, the curves on the POCO F1 were too round for my liking. Another thing that seemed to have bothered several reviewers and users alike seems to be the large âchinâ area of the device. I did not find this to be of too much concern, though. The rear panel of the POCO F1 is where you will find the dual camera setup that includes the 12-megapixel primary camera sensor and the 5-megapixel depth sensor. The secondary camera does not capture images or videos of its own and does the job of solely being a depth sensor – an arrangement that is commonly seen on cheaper Huawei and Honor devices. Beneath the twin-camera lenses is where you will find the fingerprint reader. The dual-LED flash module is located right next to the camera array. Towards the bottom of the rear panel, you get the POCO logo. This logo reads âPOCOPHONEâ on the international versions of the device. The USB Type-C port is located at the bottom which is flanked by two grilles. Only one of those grilles, however, contains the loudspeaker and the other most probably hides a microphone inside. This is also where you will find the primary noise-cancelling microphones. The 3.5mm audio jack and the secondary microphone is located at the top. Even though the polycarbonate shell of the POCO F1 might not make the phone look as premium as say, theÂ Honor Play or the ASUS Zenfone 5Z, it certainly scores better in one department. Durability. The POCO F1 can easily take a good amount of punishment and survive the travails of daily usage. The display also gets a Corning Gorilla Glass layer for additional durability. I have been using the POCO F1 without a cover and the phone has coped pretty well with my rough usage pattern. One concern I did have about the build quality, however, was the rather flimsy SIM tray that is made of plastic. In fact, a small part of the SIM tray chipped off and broke off within a week of my review.Â   Apart from the polycarbonate shell, the display is one area where Xiaomi seems to have cut corners to save money. The large 6.3-inch panel is an IPS LCD type display with a resolution of 2246Ã1080 pixels. The panel has an unconventional aspect ratio of 18.7:9. While the display itself isnât bad, when you compare it to what the competition has on offer, I noticed that our review unit did suffer a bad case of backlight bleed. Initially, I assumed this to be a one-off issue with my unit which was a non-retail version. However, soon after the F1 was launched, people started complaining en-masse about this issue. In fact, there were several threads on XDA Developers and even on MIUI Forums. At the time of publishing this review, we do not still know how widespread this screen-bleed issue on the POCO F1 is.  The bleed issue aside, the display on the POCO F1 is capable of displaying fairly accurate colours. Like all LCD panels, however, the F1 struggles with the blacks. POCO users get several options to customise the display. Most users are likely to use the phone in the default ‘Automatic Contrast’ mode. Within this option, users can choose the default colour mode, a warmer setting and a cool setting.Â In case you are not happy with the default calibrated modes, the colour wheel comes in handy. There is also a separate increased contrast mode that bumps up the contrast values several notches up. Then there is the standard mode in which the handset defaults to a slightly warmer tone. The viewing angles on the POCO device’s screen are good, but the backlight bleed issue on my unit did affect the viewing angles on the phone.  The camera setup on the POCO F1 includes a 12-megapixel sensor with f/1.9 aperture and a 5-megapixel sensor with f/2.0 aperture. The secondary camera is restricted to be used as a depth sensor. The front-facing camera sensor is a 20-megapixel unit which I believe is a straight lift from the relatively less expensive Redmi Note 5 ProÂ (Review). Xiaomi also went on to add that the phone supports a ton of AI-based features. The main camera, for example, has excellent face recognition capability and an AI-based beautify mode. This camera also supports dual-pixel autofocus and a single tone flash for more natural looking low light shots. OIS has been given a miss, and understandably so, at this price range. For the price that the POCO F1 retails (and I am talking about the more affordable, base versions here), the phone delivers excellent image quality. The POCO F1âs Achilles heel, as far as the imaging goes, would be its low-light capabilities. Daylight shots, however, turn out excellent, with great colours and dynamic range. Here are a few daylight shots that clearly demonstrate the POCO F1âs imaging prowess in good lighting conditions. The Portrait Mode on the rear camera is one of the best in its price range and even rivals several higher priced phones. The edge detection on the POCO F1 with the rear camera is also among the better ones I have seen. The front camera, thanks to its 20-megapixel sensor, is capable of some excellent selfies. This camera, too, gets a portrait mode of its own that again, works great with excellent edge detection.Â Another feature that I liked on the phone is the excellent panorama capability of the device. Look at this panorama (42MP resolution) shot to know what I am talking about. Like I said earlier, image quality takes a plunge under low light situations. The camera app UI on the POCO F1 is pretty easy to use and self-explanatory. As far as the video capability of the phone is concerned, one of the things that the POCO F1 misses out on is the capability to record 4K and 1080p videos at 60 fps. We still do not know why Xiaomi decided to omit 60fps support since the chipset is more than capable of handling it. One area where the POCO F1 does excel, though, is the slow-motion capability. The phone takes some excellent slow-motion videos at 240fps in Full-HD resolution.  The POCO F1, as you are aware, is the most affordable smartphone in India that houses the Snapdragon 845 SoC from Qualcomm. This is currently one of the fastest chip available for Android smartphones. Prior to the arrival of the Zenfone 5Z two months ago, you had to spend over Rs. 35,000 to own a device that came with this chip. After the POCO F1 happened, that amount has dropped to just Rs. 20,999. Needless to say, the POCO F1 has become one of the most sought-after devices in the sub-Rs. 30K price segment. The powerful Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 chip aside, the POCO F1 also gets LPDDR4X RAM in 8GB and 6GB capacities depending on the version you buy. One of the most talked about features of the F1 is its âLiquidCoolâ technology which is marketing-speak for a copper heatsink that helps cool down the innards of the phone when the F1 performs processor and graphics-intensive tasks. All the versions of the phone get fast UFS 2.1 based flash memory for internal storage.  Connectivity-wise, the phone gets dual-band WiFi support as well as 4G VoLTE support on both the SIM slots. Apart from support for Bluetooth 5.0, with 4G+ support, the phone is capable of latching on to two 4G bands simultaneously for faster data throughput using carrier aggregation. In the two-plus weeks that I used the POCO F1 as my primary phone, I did occasionally face some performance issues with the device. One of the issues I faced was the camera UI freezing after an image was captured. It took the phone a while to display the image after I clicked on the thumbnail to preview the image. This issue, however, was sorted in a subsequent software update. Xiaomi also quickly fixed an issue that resulted in the phone being unable to install and Play Asphalt 9. The performance of the POCO F1 saw a significant improvement after the device was updated to the newest firmware. I was not able to properly assess the call quality of the POCO F1 because both the networks I currently use, Airtel and Jio are extremely poor in the area where I am. I could, however, confirm that in areas with good connectivity, the call quality was on par with the competition. Voice clarity through the speaker, could have been better (read louder), though.  One of the things that I liked about the POCO F1 is the fact that the phone gets a stereo speaker set up. This adds a bit more realism to your video watching experience. However, the earpiece that doubles up as the left speaker in the stereo mode was a bit too low on sound and lacked depth. The sound output, therefore, feels a bit lopsided. Video playback on YouTube is fine – but thanks to the tall display and the notch, you will see two black bands on either side. You can pinch to zoom to mitigate this issue, though.  In case you are an avid Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar or Netflix watcher, you might be disappointed to know that all videos on these platforms would top out at 540p resolution on the POCO F1âs Full-HD display. This is because the phone does not support Widevine L1 – a DRM encryption scheme for playing back protected and licensed video content on Android devices.  The POCO F1 doubles up as a competent music player if you own a good pair of headphones/earphones. MIUI lets you customise the sound output to suit the type of headphones you own – a feature I hitherto saw on the Zenfone 5Z a few months ago. The equaliser is also enabled when you start using the 3.5mm audio jack or a pair of Bluetooth earphones.  While not an avid gamer, I did install a couple of games on the phone for the sake of this review. Thanks to the powerful Snapdragon 845 chip with the Adreno 630 GPU, currently the most powerful GPU available for Android devices, the POCO F1 is more than capable of handling nearly everything you throw at it. The excellent cooling system ensures that the phone does not heat up even after extended periods of gaming.Â As far as benchmarks are concerned we ran the usual set that includes AnTuTu, Geekbench and 3D Mark. Take a look at the benchmark results in the screenshots below. The POCO F1 runs a customised version of MIUI 9.6 atop an Android 8.1 Oreo core. What differentiates the F1 from other Xiaomi devices with MIUI is its brand new launcher – the rather obviously named ‘POCO Launcher for MIUI’. The default theme on the handset is also exclusive for the POCO F1. The major difference between the standard MIUI launcher and the POCO launcher is the fact that the latter now offers users an app drawer. Users can either use gestures for navigation (which might take a while to get used to) or use the traditional virtual navigation buttons to navigate around the UI.  The app drawer by default arranges apps by their type. There are multiple tabs under which apps are âdroppedâ once you install them. I believe there were simply too many categories (I counted ten in all). Thankfully, the first tab lists all the apps together irrespective of their type. The app search bar is now conveniently placed at the bottom area of the screen. This arrangement did take me some time to get used to, though, but it is easier to use. Since the phone runs a customised version of MIUI, you can use themes to change the look and feel of the UI. The rest of the features are the same ones you have seen on other MIUI based phones. Some of the more interesting features include support for dual apps that allows two instances of the same app running at the same time. Then there are the button and gesture shortcuts that allow you to do small things like turning the camera on, taking a screenshot and opening the split screen mode using a gesture of your choice.  The POCO F1 has two biometric methods of unlocking – the good old fingerprint scanner and the newer Face Unlock mechanism. While most of its contemporaries (including the mighty OnePlus 6) use the front facing camera to recognize the user and unlock the phone, the POCO F1 uses the more advanced IR face unlock method. The IR method ensures that the phone is able to âseeâ your face even in pitch dark environments. This is a situation where most other phones with the camera based 2D Face Unlock feature fails to work. One of the reasons I am personally not a fan of MIUI is because of the sheer number of preinstalled apps that it usually comes with. The POCO F1 is no exception to this. The phone comes preloaded with apps that include Xiaomiâs own security app, a cleaner app, Mi Store, and UC Browser among others.    Thanks to the large 4,000 mAh battery, the POCO F1 will easily last you one full day even with relatively heavy usage. I was able to consistently eke out more than 7 hours of screen on time with the device. You just need to ensure that the display brightness is set to slightly above 50 per cent.  At launch, Xiaomi did confirm that the POCO F1 supports Quick Charge 3.0. In our tests, the phone took a little over two hours to fully charge. Even with fast charging support, the POCO F1 takes nearly 40 minutes to charge to 50%. This is notably slower than most other devices with fast charge support. A few weeks after launch, Xiaomi also added that the POCO F1 supports Quick Charge 4.0 as well. I did try charging the phone with a non-certified QC 4.0 charger, but the phone did not fast charge.  For a long time now, it used to be devices from OnePlus devices that held the mantle of the âaffordable flagshipâ. However, with almost all new OnePlus devices now priced above the Rs. 35,000 mark, there was a clear void in the attractive Rs. 20K to Rs. 35K price segment. ASUS was the first one to target this void with its excellent Zenfone 5Z. Not to be left behind, Honor one-upped ASUS by coming up with the Honor Play, which mind you, is the most affordable of the lot with the base version costing just Rs. 19,990.  The Honor Playâs bane, however, is that it uses Huaweiâs Kirin 970 chip instead of the more popular Snapdragon 845 chipset from Qualcomm which means it falls slightly behind the POCO F1 in the benchmarks. In real life situations, however, the difference is hardly noticeable. The Honor Play also falls behind the POCO in some other aspects like the slow-motion video capability and the amount of RAM. Qualcomm clearly does GPU and ISP better than Huawei. The ASUS Zenfone 5Z is a more premium and well-rounded offering for its price and does not make any compromises (save for the lack of splash and water resistance). With the base version of the POCO F1 priced at just Rs. 20,999, the POCO F1 is able to attract two sets of buyers. These include people who had a budget of 16-17k for a smartphone and would not mind waiting for a month, save some more and get a more powerful device. Then there is the crowd that had a budget of over Rs. 25K to Rs. 35K and were considering devices like the Zenfone 5Z, the Honor 10 and the entry-level versions of the OnePlus 6 and they suddenly have an option that is lighter on the pocket. In case you belong to the former category, the POCO F1 would make for an excellent upgrade over the likes of the Redmi Note 5 Pro, the Mi A2 and the Zenfone Max Pro M1Â (Review). However, if you have a budget of over Rs. 25,000, I still believe that the Zenfone 5Z offers the most bang for your bucks. The Zenfone 5Z scores better in the imaging department, it has a much nicer display, the video recording capabilities are excellent, and the audio performance with its dedicated amplifier is unbeatable (at least in its price segment). The only area where it falls behind the POCO F1 is the lower storage capacity on the base version and the lower resolution for slow-motion videos.Â To simplify my conclusion, the POCO F1 is your best bet in case you have a budget of less than Rs. 25,000. If you have more than Rs. 25,000 to spend, the Zenfone 5Z makes for a more sensible choice for most people. All said and done, I have to give full credits to Xiaomi for coming up with something like the POCO F1.

3,By Abid Iqbal -  ,NA,NA,"Sep 24, 2018"," The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro, which was launched recently along with the Redmi 6A and the Redmi 6, comes as a slightly expensive alternative to the ultra-popular Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 (Review). The device brings two significant upgrades over the Redmi Note 5; a notched display for a higher screen-to-body ratio, and a dual-camera setup for better image quality. It retains the same hardware as the Redmi Note 5, though, including a metal body, Snapdragon 625 processor, and a massive 4000mAh battery. At a glance, it looks like a fair deal, spending a thousand bucks more for a compact design and a better camera, right? Well, thereâs a catch. The Redmi 6 Pro misses out on 4K video recording and it has a slightly smaller display. So should you spend the extra money on the Redmi 6 Pro over the Redmi Note 5? Here is what I think after using the device for a couple of weeks now.Â  The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro features an all-new front design, courtesy of the notched, bezel-less display. The device is now more compact than its predecessor, and also looks in-line with the latest trend. The notch itself is tiny, unlike on the few other competitors such as the Nokia 6.1 Plus. The notch houses the earpiece, camera, and a couple of sensors. Switching to the back, it has the same, plain metal design that we are used to seeing with Xiaomi smartphones. The metal body feels robust and premium. The metal body of the device feels robust and premium. The device is slightly thicker than usual. This is mainly due to the limited vertical and horizontal space as a result of bezel cut-down. The thickness actually works in favour of the device; it offers more grip to the user while holding it. This is also the main reason why I managed to get through reviewing the device without even dropping it once. The fingerprint scanner is placed very conveniently on the back, making it easier to reach and unlock the device. Although, not everything is placed conveniently. Take the notification LED for example; it is placed on the bottom bezel, which is very odd. That being said, it does not hinder any functionality. For the price, there are smartphones that look way more attractive than the Redmi 6 Pro. Nonetheless, the Redmi 6 Pro is a beautiful smartphone and one that is very well built.  The Redmi 6 Pro is the first smartphone from Xiaomi in India to come with a notched display. The screen also has a taller, 19:9 aspect ratio. This sure makes the device more compact and gives it a better visual appeal. However, the fact that Android apps are yet to adopt the taller aspect ratio and the notch presents some issues while viewing videos and browsing through social media apps. Fortunately, though, there is an option to hide the notch for those who hate it. One of the best screens among its competitors, and you canât get better than this in its price range. The 5.84-inch IPS LCD screen has a resolution of 2280Ã1080 pixels. The display is sharp and colourful, which makes consuming media on it an absolute joy. The outdoor visibility is good, thanks to the high brightness levels and a low reflective surface, at least for its price. The display, however, poses issue while displaying gradients of black and white, but that is the case with every budget smartphone out there, so Xiaomi isnât to blame here. The Redmi 6 Pro has one of the best screens among its competitors, and I think you canât get better than this in its price range.Â   Even budget smartphones nowadays come with a dual-camera setup, where one camera captures images, while the other acts as the depth-sensor. However, most of the budget smartphones with dual-camera setup use a low-resolution sensor for the depth-sensing camera; mostly a 2MP unit. Unlike them, the Redmi 6 Pro has a 12MP + 5MP dual-camera hardware, which looks promising on paper. Before we jump to the camera performance, letâs talk about the camera UI. In my opinion, the camera UI is neat, and simple to use. You can easily switch between modes by just swiping over the camera viewfinder, which includes your usual photo and video modes along with Square, Short Video, Portrait, and Panorama modes. The setting for each mode is neatly tucked into the modes themselves.Â  The image quality from this camera is excellent in the daylight. The images turn out colourful, bright, and full of details. There is a very minimal amount of noise, which is visible only if zoomed-in at 100%. The phase-detection autofocus does a brilliant job of focusing quickly and accurately. The dynamic range is also pretty good, and the camera manages to capture scenes with tricky lighting conditions very well.Â  The image quality, however, takes a hit during low-light conditions. There is a fair amount of noise in the images. Though the amount of details captured isnât too bad, it could have been better. The colours reproduced are very vivid and thus saves the images from looking too shabby. Having tested enough smartphone cameras, I can firmly say that the lowlight image quality from the Redmi 6 Pro is better than what most of the other smartphones in the same price range offer. Coming to the Portrait mode, the camera produces some brilliant bokeh-effect images, that is if it works. It is kind of hit or miss. If it captures right, the images come out with great depth of field. Although, if it misses, youâll be served with a scruffy background blur. Also, the Portrait mode is totally useless in low-light conditions. The camera just refuses to blur-out the background in such poorly lit conditions. The Redmi 6 Pro offers the best image quality among all its competitors with its rear camera. Jumping to the Panorama mode, which I guess not many people will use, I was surprised to see that the device is capable of capturing 13-megapixels Panorama images. This is quite unusual for smartphones in this price range, as most of them max out at around 5-megapixels. Take the Galaxy J6 for example. These panorama images have excellent stitching and details. The camera also compensates for the change in lighting conditions very well. Coming to the front-facing camera, it is a 5-megapixel unit with Æ/2.0 aperture. This camera performs very well in the daylight. It takes detailed and vivid images. In low light, the images arenât very bright, but not dull either. Xiaomi has also managed to pack the front-facing camera with the portrait mode, which takes help of the software to blur-out the background. This works very well most of the time. Although, just like the Portrait mode in the primary camera, this one too has a hit and miss performance. While the cheaper alternative of the Redmi 6 Pro, which is the Redmi Note 5, can record 4K videos, the former canât in spite of having the same amount of processing power. Iâm not sure if this is a cost-cutting measure, or a deliberate effort to keep the 4K video recording exclusive to the Redmi Note 5. Either way, Iâm disappointed. That being said, the Full HD video recording that the Redmi 6 Pro offers, has a very good quality, including smooth video stabilisation, vivid colours, and a decent amount of details. Overall, I think the Redmi 6 Pro offers the best image quality among all its competitors with its rear camera. The selfie camera isnât the best out there in the price range, but it does an excellent job, and I donât see any reason to complain about it. I just wish that the Redmi 6 Pro had the 4K video recording, which would have made it a complete package.  The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro comes with the same, tried-and-tested, Snapdragon 625 processor that weâve seen from the past two generations of Xiaomi smartphones. You have an option to choose between the 3GB+32GB variant and 4GB+64GB variant. The one we got for the review has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The device runs on Android 8.1 Oreo OS, which, as you can expect, is coated with MIUI 9.6 skin. Snapdragon 625 is showing its age and lacks the processing and graphics power to run a Full HD+ display smoothly. Initially, I found the Redmi 6 Pro to have a fast and smooth performance. However, as I started using it more and more, I realised that it isnât smooth after all. The phone is notably slow at opening apps. It also stutters frequently, may it be while using apps, switching between them, or just surfing through the UI. The Snapdragon 625 is to blame here. It is showing its age and lacks the processing and graphics power to run a Full HD+ display smoothly. Although, this could also be because of poor customisation. Either way, this is not what we have come to expect from Xiaomi smartphones. It is time that Xiaomi opts for a better performing chipset to maintain a fast performance, and also the brandâs image. Coming to the software, the MIUI 9.6 offers immense UI customisation. It packs tons and tons of features including the essentials such as the dual-apps, app-locker, Second Space (for hiding files), and customisable themes. The design of the UI is modern, and it looks very polished. I would prefer the MIUI over the customisations from Honor, Vivo, and Oppo any day. That being said, the MIUI does have its flaws, and the most significant is the lack of application drawer. Although this can be fixed with any third party launcher. MIUI 9.6 offers immense UI customisations. As for the connectivity, the device has a dual-SIM card slot which supports 4G LTE with VoLTE. However, only one SIM card can work on the 4G network at a time. It would have been great to see both the SIM cards supporting 4G network, but no other manufacturer is offering that in this price range yet. The call quality and the network reception were flawless for the period I used the device. There is also dual-band Wi-Fi, which has fast transfer speeds. The only thing I miss in the connectivity department is the lack of USB Type-C port. Well, not many budget smartphones have it, but I think it is time for brands like Xiaomi to bring this change. Coming to the audio, the speaker of the Redmi 6 Pro is quite loud and has a decent quality. The 3.5mm audio jack also puts out a solid performance with high volume levels and decently balanced sound signature. This is one of the best battery back-ups you could get out of a smartphone. The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro packs a hefty 4000mAh battery. The combination of the large battery pack and a power-efficient processor yielded an average usage time of one and a half day with around 7 hours of screen-on time. In non-technical terms, this is one of the best battery back-ups you could get out of a smartphone. The only bummer, however, has to be the lack of fast charging; hence, the device takes almost three hours to fill a totally drained battery.  The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro isnât the fastest smartphone its segment and lacks 4K video recording, which weâve come to expect from smartphones in this price range. Although, those were the only two major drawbacks of the phone. Apart from that, it gets everything else right. All-in-all, the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is a great package, and absolutely worth buying. The Redmi 6 Pro has a solid build quality, and its display is a joy to look at. The cameras do a brilliant job at capturing images, considering the price of the device, and the device has one heck of a battery backup. On top of that, there is the beautiful and feature-packed MIUI skin. All-in-all, the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is a great package, and absolutely worth buying. Now, for those who are confused between Redmi Note 5 and the Redmi 6 Pro, it all comes down to personal preference. If you donât want to lose out on 4K video recording, then get the Redmi Note 5, or else, the Redmi 6 Pro is the way to go. Asif’s younger brother is the newest addition to the Gear team.
