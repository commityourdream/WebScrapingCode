0,Reviewed By Sameer Mitha,"[Not for power users, Not great for graphically heavy gaming, Camera's performance suffers in low light, No fingerprint sensor]","[Strong plastic build, Camera clicks good pics in well-lit situations, Works for basic use]",31 - Aug - 2018,"   The phone has a good build and the performance is average. It has stock Android UI and Amazon’s brand value which is nice. However, for a thousand rupees more you can get the Redmi 5 which has a fingerprint sensor (something the 10.or D2 lacks) and a metal build. The 10.or D2 works if you will use the phone for calling, messaging, social networking and some video consumption. However, start multitasking and heavy gaming and you will be left wanting more!  If you are looking for a smartphone in the sub 10k price bracket, then you have a few options to choose from. The most popular device under the sub 10k segment has to be the Redmi 5. The Redmi 5 priced at Rs 8,999 brings with it 32GB built-in storage coupled with 3GB RAM. It also has the Snapdragon 450 SoC. The 10.or D2 is priced at Rs 7,999 making it a thousand rupees cheaper than the current budget king. Is the worth saving Rs 1000 and picking up the 10.or D2? Read on to find out. Thickness: 7.1cm
Weight: 150 grams
CPU: Snapdragon 425 SoC
OS & UI: Android 8.1
Display: 5.45-inch 18:9 display
Display resolution: 1440 x 720p
Rear Camera: 13MP
Front camera: 5MP
RAM: 3GB (available in 2GB as well)
Built-in storage: 32GB (available in 16GB as well)
Battery: 3200mAh
Dual-SIM: Yes
Price: Rs. 6,999 for the 2GB RAM, 16GB storage variant and Rs 7,999 for the 3GB RAM, 32GB variant.  The first thing that you will notice when you hold the device is that it is made of plastic, but the plastic doesn’t feel cheap. It is well constructed rounding off towards the edges at the back which makes the phone comfortable to grip. The back of the device reminds me of the Nokia Lumia 530 and that is a good thing. At the back you have a single camera accompanied by an LED flash. There is no fingerprint sensor on the phone and that is a bummer considering its predecessor had one. The speaker grill is located at the back of the device. At the bottom you have the microUSB port and the headphones jack rests on top. The right of the device has the power button and the volume rocker. The power button and volume rocker are clicky making them comfortable to use.  The front of the 10.or D2 has an 18:9 display but it doesn’t feel unnaturally tall like some other smartphones. That is because the size of the display is 5.45-inches. The display size along with the rounded plastic back makes the smartphone comfortable and convenient to use with one hand. However, it is tough to reach the top of the smartphone with single handed use and there is no way to swipe down in the middle of the display to bring the drop-down notifications which is a bummer. You will need to resort to your second hand or adjust your grip on the smartphone to reach all possible corners. Sticking with the front of the device it is nice to see that the smartphone doesn’t have a notch and that is something I really like. Overall the build of the device is what you’d expect from a budget smartphone. Its plastic and feels sturdy. The design is simple, uninspiring and the 10.or D2 can easily get lost in a crowd of smartphones. The 10.or D2 has a dedicated microSD card slot so you don’t need to choose between a second SIM or an SD card which is nice.  Speaking of the display, the 10.or D2 has an 18:9 display with a 720 x 1440-pixel count. This means the display is essentially 720p. On a 5.45-inch display, it would have been great to see a 1080p display. Where the display succeeds is with its viewing angles. The display has good viewing angles. Watching content from YouTube, Netflix or Prime Videos is a good experience. However, I wish the display were a little brighter. If you will consume content indoors or in situations where the light isn’t a lot, then you should be fine. However, stand directly under the sun and the display’s performance will diminish. The display has a maximum luminance of 448 lux. Overall, considering the price of the phone, the display gets the job done.  Coming to sound, it is loud but isn’t clear. The on full volume you and your friends will be able to huddle around the smartphone and watch a movie trailer, but the sound feels muddled. Background music and dialogues do not feel sperate and that can lead to an uncomfortable listening experience. The placement of the speaker is at the back making it easy to cover with your hand. I like the placement of the speaker on Samsung’s J6 for example (which is on the side next to the power button). The placement of the speaker on that device is ergonomic. Overall, you’d do better to invest in a pair of headphones to enjoy content on this smartphone.  Coming to the call quality from the earpiece it is good and clear. Whatever problems we faced with the audio during a call was mostly due to bad cellular reception. There are times when the audio leaked from the earpiece at full volume, but that’s also because the person at the other end was talking loudly.  Speaking of the UI on the 10.or D2, the smartphone runs on Android 8.1.0 out of the box. Considering the phone is made by Amazon, it has a bunch of Amazon apps preloaded. Sadly, you can’t uninstall the Amazon apps for space on the smartphone. Apart from the preloaded apps, the UI is stock Android which is good. The UI is fluid until you get into heavy multitasking which is where things wills stutter. Opening social networking apps and video streaming apps keeps the device fluid but throw in some games and you will notice a slowdown. Overall, the UI is simple and basic and will work for those that don’t want a fancy UI to overlay on their smartphone. If you are looking for a stock Android solution at this price point and don’t want to go for Mi UI on the Redmi 5, then you can consider this. It works well for basic use. When it comes to real world performance, the device isn’t meant for heavy use. Social networking and watching movies work fine but play Asphalt 9 for 15 minutes and you will see the device fall apart. Not only did we get an average frame rate of 16 frames per second, but also, the device started to stutter for a good 2 minutes even after shutting down the game. If you are looking for a gaming centric phone, then you will need to look elsewhere. However, games like Threes and other simple games that aren’t graphically heavy will work fine.  In everyday performance I’d say remember to close apps in the background as they will affect performance going forward. We have the 3GB variant of the phone. The 2GB RAM variant may struggle more over time. Watching YouTube, Netflix, and switching to WhatsApp and then making a call and coming back to the video, all worked well. When it comes to the optics, the smartphone ‘s rear camera performs surprisingly well when the lighting situation is favourable. In well lit situations the images have some details (considering the price point of the smartphone) and work well for social media posts. Reduce the light and you will see a lot of noise. Don’t expect to get good images in a dark club or under the moonlight. The same can be said for the front camera.        (Above images resized for web) When it comes to video recording, the smartphone can capture video in 1080p and you have the option of 60fps. However, tapping on the display captures an image and doesn’t shift the point of focus which can be a bummer for some while recording videos. The 10.or D2 has a 3200mAh battery. Starting the day with 100% battery, I was between 15 and 20 percent at the end of the day that involved my standard slew of calls and messages mixed with some YouTubing and some gaming. I kept the brightness of the phone on auto for the most part. In the PC mark battery test, the device lasted for 6 hours and 16 minutes.  The 3GB 32GB variant of the Redmi 5 is priced at Rs 8,999. Considering the device has a fingerprint sensor, and a good build it is hard to recommend the 10.or D2 for a thousand rupees less. If you are one that is looking for a stock Android experience and heavy use isn’t something you are looking for and want the backing of Amazon’s brand value, then yes, you can consider it. The device has a camera that can click good photos in well lit situations, but low light suffers. The display has good viewing angles, but the performance of the device is average at best.    10.or (pronounced Tenor) has launched the 10.or D2 smartphone which is built using insights and feedback from thousands of customer reviews on...

Update: The alleged media...",10.or D2 32GB  Review ,135632,https://www.digit.in/mobile-phones/10-or-d2-32gb-review-135632.html,NA
1,Reviewed By Swapnil Mathur,"[Lack of FullHD display is disappointing, No dual camera setup, No support for HDR10 or Dolby Vision, Very limited portrait mode]","[Runs on A12 Bionic processor, fastest as of now, Impressive battery life, Premium build quality]",31 - Oct - 2018,"   The iPhone XR sports Apple's fastest processor yet, the A12 Bionic chip and comes with a near-bezel-less design. However minor things like the lack of an HD display, no dual camera and a terribly limited portrait mode makes the smartphone feel like an unnecessarily overpriced device.  Apple’s September 12th keynote saw the world be introduced to the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, Apple’s new “standard” for the iPhone. But what the company also announced was the iPhone XR, a third iPhone that’s an amalgamation of all the things, good and bad, that came before it. Apple pegged the $750 iPhone XR as the device through which they will be able to reach out to newer customers. It has a number of tricks up its sleeve and misses the mark on a few things, so let’s see if this Rs 76900-rupee pocket computer is worth your (or your rich parents’) hard earned money. Apple hasn’t deviated much from what they include in the box of the new iPhone. While expectations were high about an included fast charger or a USB-C to Lightning, sadly, no such items are in the box. In fact, Apple has gone ahead and removed the Lightning to 3.5mm headphone jack converter. Here’s everything that Apple includes in the box of the iPhone XR. The minute you lay your eyes on the iPhone XR, you get a flashback to the iPhone 5C. The XR comes in a multitude of colours (6 to be exact), of which all but silver and black are worth your time. Personally, I was partial to the Coral finish, but unfortunately, we were allotted a black unit of the iPhone XR. The colours are a unique aspect of the iPhone XR’s design, in fact, it’s the most prominent aspect of the phone and on that account, we have sadly been shortchanged. Anyhow. The anodized aluminium has a matte finish unlike the glossy one found on the iPhone XS, so that’s good. The back of the iPhone XR is treated with the same colour treatment as the frame, but the colouring is done below the glass back. The glass back still attracts fingerprints like every other phone with a glass back, but the aluminium frame does feel very solid and easy to get a grip on.  Unlike the iPhone XS and XS Max which are IP68 rated, the iPhone XR has an IP67 rating, meaning it can withstand being submerged under water up to a depth of 1 meter for a maximum of 30 minutes. Apple says that even though this isn’t IP68 rated, they have tested the iPhone XR to be resistant to the usual suspects such as beer, juice, soft drinks etc. Looking at the iPhone XR from the front, you will be hard-pressed to distinguish it from the X-series. Apple has unified the design across its entire smartphone range for 2018, which means that you get a premium design found on the super expensive iPhone XS on an iPhone that costs 25 percent less. The iPhone XR’s display is the first sign of where the phone takes a huge step back. The iPhone XR has a 6.1-inch IPS-LCD display which Apple calls “Liquid Retina” and is apparently the best LCD display the company has produced to date. With a resolution of 1792x828, the display has a pixel density of 326ppi. For some reason, Apple thought it was a good idea to increase the display size over the iPhone 8 Plus but reduce the resolution so that the pixel density matches that of the iPhone 8. It is a little bothersome that a phone that costs more than the iPhone 8 Plus at launch doesn’t even have an HD screen. If you’re a “by-the-numbers” kind of person, you may not appreciate this. The iPhone XR has slightly thicker bezels than the iPhone XS, but honestly, it is in no way a detriment. To test the display’s adeptness for daily use, we tested out the quality of video playback across YouTube, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video. YouTube allowed me to select the playback resolution for all the videos all the way up to 4K, but the playback resolution will always be limited to the 720p. If you have anything above the very basic Netflix plan, get ready to be disappointed at the lack of pixels and HDR. It pinched a little to know that someone would spend Rs 76900 on the iPhone XR and not be able to make the most of their Netflix subscription. Despite the shortfall in the number, watching content on the iPhone XR’s display feels satisfactory, with very impressive colour reproduction. Black levels too are fairly good, despite the LCD panel which generally isn’t capable of rendering true blacks.  The display is very legible under bright lights with minimal reflectance. It isn’t as bright as the iPhone XS’s panel, but it’s still bright enough for you to go about your daily activities such as playing games, texting, emailing, browsing social media etc without any problems. While content looks good on the iPhone XR, put it next to an iPhone XS or even the similarly sized Samsung Galaxy S9 and you will start to see the impact of the less-than-HD resolution. Even the LG G7+ ThinQ offers an IPS-LCD display, but with 2K resolution and an HDR10 enabled panel. It’s even brighter than the iPhone XR’s display and costs Rs 40,000. At this point, the iPhone XR is the only flagship of 2018 which doesn’t even sport an HD display and that, frankly, is disappointing. The display is definitely functional, you don’t feel like you’re viewing content on a “poor quality” display, but you do definitely notice the lower resolution, but only if you have regular access to a smartphone with a higher resolution (2K or above) display. For anyone who cares, the iPhone XR’s display doesn’t have Force Touch either. I personally love the feature and it is just weird to not see a feature which was present in the previous generation of the iPhone. ~Performance is one area where the iPhone XR makes significant leaps forward. The XR is powered by the same A12 Bionic processor as the more expensive iPhone XS (Review). The new A12 Bionic is manufactured on the 7nm process, making it not only more powerful than the 10nm counterpart, but also more power-efficient. In that regard, the iPhone XR does not disappoint. Throughout the benchmarks, the iPhone XR maintained its lead over all Android flagships and matched the performance of the far more expensive iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max (Review).   When it comes to real-world performance, you’d be hard pressed to differentiate between the iPhone XR and the far more expensive models. Whether it's editing the RAW files from the camera or playing PubG, you will not find a single reason to be unhappy. There is literally nothing that makes the iPhone XR slow down, although, the phone does tend to heat up under heavy use. I observed that after 15 minutes of playing Asphalt 9, the area just below the camera module did get pretty hot. I repeated the test several times over the last few weeks using Asphalt 9, Fortnite and also Injustice 2 and noticed that heating, in general, is an issue. The phone doesn’t get hot enough to cause alarm, but it did get warm enough for us to take notice since most flagships that have been tested in our test lab in the last few months have not had such an issue. Overall, as a daily driver, the iPhone XR is nothing short of a thoroughbred when it comes to performance. It does not give into any app and cuts through even the most demanding workloads like a hot knife through butter. The camera, in some ways, again feels like a slight step back when considering the iPhone XR. You only get a single camera on the back, a 12-megapixel sensor paired with an optically stabilized f/1.8 lens. The new sensor has more phase detect pixels now for better focusing and a wicked smartHDR algorithm that takes imaging to the next level. Apple has decided to omit the telephoto lens from the XR, as a means of making sure you remember that you bought the “cheaper” iPhone.  When it comes to sensor performance, again, the wide-angle lens delivers results at par with the iPhone XS. The photos from daytime are well lit, with the exposure well balanced to accommodate the highlights and the shadows. For well-lit scenarios, the iPhone XR does exceedingly well. Even in low light, the imaging stack is no slouch, with the results looking properly exposed, but lacking in detail due to aggressive noise reduction. 
The iPhone XR's 26mm wide-angle camera is capable of capturing great photos in good light 
Indoor shots with average (or higher) amount of lighting come out looking good The iPhone XR also happens to offer portrait mode on a single lens, but unlike what we see on the Google Pixel smartphones, this one is purely a machine-learning based solution and not a great one at that. For starters, the field of view in Portrait Mode remains that of the wide-angle lens. While this isn’t a make-or-break by itself, what will be a deal breaker for many is the fact that Portrait Mode only works if there is a person in the frame. Even then, there are distance-based limitations. What this means is that you cannot use Portrait Mode on the iPhone XR to shoot nice photos of objects or anything that’s not a human being. I take a lot of photos of my dog and not being able to shoot him in Portrait Mode was a huge bummer. However, there are some third-party developers who are working on bringing Portrait Mode for pets and objects to the iPhone XR, but there’s no word on when this would actually happen. The iPhone XR does offer three of the five portrait lighting mode, so that’s good. 
Portrait Mode is limited to shooting human faces only Regardless, the iPhone XR does take marvellous images, but the lack of a secondary camera is definitely going to pinch, especially given that the XR is priced the same as last year’s iPhone 8 Plus. If you must have a secondary lens, then you have no choice but to go for the more expensive iPhone XS. The iPhone XR offers the exact same front-facing setup as the more expensive iPhone XS, so that is a step forward. There’s a 7-megapixel camera with a f/2.2 lens which is augmented by a depth sensor for portrait mode. Honestly, the front-facing camera does a far better job at portraits than the rear camera, thanks to hardware that allows for the camera to capture more than just pixels. The result is images worthy of not just Instagram, but also perhaps display photos across whatever platform or even prints. The front facing camera also offers autofocus which is great if you’re taking photos in tricky conditions, such as dense crowds. There’s very little reason to be unhappy with the performance of the iPhone XR’s front-facing camera, seeing how it performs at par with the more expensive iPhone XS and the iPhone XS Max.    The iPhone XR comes toting a 2952mAh battery which lasted 8 hours and 15 minutes on the Geekbench battery test. In real life, the phone’s battery easily lasted a day and a half, despite the LCD display. The lowered resolution of the panel probably stems the battery drain, but the A12 Bionic chipset can also be attributed to the impressive battery life. Basically, despite the bigger display and using an LCD panel at that, the iPhone XR manages to last longer than the iPhone XS, and almost as long as the iPhone XR. The Apple iPhone XR is supposed to be the ""affordable iPhone"" and in the spirit of that, Apple has removed a few features as a means of incentivising people to go for the higher end iPhone XS or the iPhone XS Max. While you don't get the dual-camera setup or even a full HD display, you do get the fastest processor in the smartphone world right now to cut through any demanding task. The 64GB Apple iPhone XR still makes sense for people who may be upgrading from the iPhone 6 or earlier, but the higher storage variants make even less sense. The 256GB variant which we reviewed costs Rs 91,900 just a few thousand short of the iPhone XS which is a no-compromise smartphone. The base variant of the iPhone XR costs Rs 76900 and for the price, there are enough Android counterparts which offer a no-compromise feature-set. If you are someone who's tied into the Apple eco-system and refuse to go outside of it, and if you have one of the older iPhones, then you could consider the iPhone XR. However, even when paying such a premium, you will have to accept the absence of certain essentials features.
