0,LG V40 ThinQ Review: Phone for audiophiles and creative photographers,https://www.gizbot.com//mobile/reviews/lg-v40-thinq-review-phone-audiophiles-creative-photographers-057899.html,PROS  Interesting and capable camera setupExcellent 2K displayDurable design and feels super premium in handsBest-in-class audio experience,CONS  Battery life could have been betterNot the best camera for low-light photographyDated Android OreoMarket now offers smartphones with latest hardware and software," LG V40's 5-lens camera setup is simply one-of-its-kind on a smartphone. The camera assembly comprises of 12MP 2x Zoom Telephoto lens with OIS and PDAF (F/2.4), 16MP Ultrawide-angle lens with no autofocus (F/1.9) , and 12MP Standard lens with dual PDAF and OIS (F/1.5 aperture). The front gets dual-lens setup featuring an 8MP standard lens and a 5MP wide-angle lens. The telephoto lens at the rear offers a 45 deg. Field of view (FOV) and takes you closer to the subjects. It is the lens that you should use while taking close up shots. The standard lens, which you will use most of the time, offers a decent 78 deg. FOV. Then comes the LG's signature Ultrawide-angle lens, which has improved a lot in the last few years and offers 107 deg. FOV on LG V40 ThinQ. I am simply a fan of LG's ultra-wide angle lens. It is undoubtedly the best on a smartphone, better than Samsung's and Huawei's ultra-wide angle lens' implementation and gives your photography a new perspective. The distorting effect is almost negligible in images shot with an ultra-wide angle lens. The 5-lens camera assembly makes LG V40 ThinQ a brilliant phone for photographers who love to explore the world around them. The much improved wide-angle lens makes for a very good add-on for landscape shots to capture scenic views. The wide-angle perspective also makes everyday shots of streets, buildings, etc. quite appealing. If you also like to explore the rush of busy Indian cities, the triple-lens camera system will come really handy. LG has also added a variety of Cinematography effects in â€˜Cine Vide' mode that makes video shooting quite interesting. You also get a Manual mode for Video which is simply a great add-on on a smartphone. If you want to capture one single frame in all three perspectives, simply use the Triple shot mode. When enabled, V40 takes a shot with each of the three cameras and presents you the same image captured in ultra wide, normal, and with the telephoto lens. Besides, the AI composition gives you a better representation of colors and also suggests the right lens to use while framing a shot. LG's AI implementation is a bit smarter than other manufacturers approach of using machine learning to improve the photography experience. The whole package makes LG V40 ThinQ the best camera smartphone for content creators, cinematographers, and videographers. Coming onto image quality, the pictures show excellent contrast, punchy colors and good details in daylight. The V40's camera also captures a great amount of dynamic range on clear days. The blue color of the sky and greens of trees are beautifully captured. The sharpness in images is not at par with Google Pixel devices though. Besides, you will notice a shift in color balance in images shot with the three lenses. And as usual, LG's camera software still creates a posterized effect in order to keep the noise in check when images are shot in unfavorable lighting. If you can make peace with some level of noise, the three lenses perform a good job when the sun sets. However, I must mention that LG V40 ThinQ is still not my first preference for low-light photography. Google Pixel 3 and even Pixel 2/2XL phones are still the most recommended phones for low-light photography and even for portrait shots which is another area where LG V40 ThinQ struggles. LG V40 ThinQ boasts a big 6.4-inches QHD+ OLED panel that offers a resolution of 1,440 x 3,120 pixels. This translates to a pixel density of 538 ppi making videos, pictures, and text super crisp. The new OLED panel by LG is vibrant, produces more accurate colors and is also fairly bright at the same time making it easy to use the handset outdoors. The screen on LG V40 ThinQ is better than Honor View 20's LCD panel and even better than OnePlus 6T's AMOLED display in terms of contrast and sharpness. However, there's one drawback. The display on LG V40 ThinQ has a big notch and slightly thicker bezels on all four sides than the competition. It did not bother me much in everyday use even after considering the fact that I have recently tested the above two mentioned handsets. LG V40 ThinQ looks and feels super premium in hands. It is also one-of-the most durable smartphone out there in the market. The phone is IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. The front and back are protected by Gorilla Glass 5 and the phone also gets MIL-STD-810G military certification for shock resistance. The rear panel has a smooth glossy finish but it picks up far fewer smudges than the other flagships that sport glass backs. As far as usability is concerned, the phone is very light and can be used with one hand for screen navigation, dialer, scrolling FB, Instagram feed and while browsing web pages. I would recommend using both hands while using the camera and controlling volume by physical buttons as V40 ThinQ is extremely slippery and essentially a big phone for users with small hands. LG has put a lot of hard work to make V40 the best sounding smartphone in its respective price-point. Resultant, the sound delivery produced by V40 (with and without headphones) is extremely immersive. The audio is loud and accurate. The smartphone comes equipped with DTS:X Surround sound with Boom-Box speaker. The speaker uses the empty space in V40 ThinQ's body as a sound chamber to produce richer audio experience. While playing games and streaming audio/video files, you can actually feel the phone's body resonating with the audio. The audio output is tuned by the British company- Meridian Audio and creates an immersive sound experience. It comes as s surprise that the flagship V40 ThinQ is still running the old Android 8.1.0 in the year 2019. The smartphone is due to receive the Android Pie update sooner or later. LG needs to rework on its software update cycles as the brand is clearly ignoring this critical part of its mobility division. LG V40 ThinQ is backed by Snapdragon 845 chipset. The phone has 6 GB LPDDR4x RAM and 128 GB internal storage. The V40 ThinQ also has microSD card support to expand the internal memory to up to 512GB. This is no doubt flagship hardware but now when other manufacturers are ready to introduce smartphones with the newest Snapdragon 855 SoC, LG V40 ThinQ might not hold up well in the race of flagships. While there are no performance issues with LG V40 ThinQ, you might not want to spend a sum of 50K on a smartphone with last year's flagship chipset and dated Android Oreo. LG needs to fasten up launch cycles in the Indian market if they really want to sell mobile devices in huge numbers. The V40 ThinQ could have done a lot better if it had been launched in the same or next month in India after the global launch. LG V40 ThinQ is backed by probably the least powerful battery cell on a flagship smartphone. The phone is backed by a 3,300 battery unit which cannot last for a day if you a heavy user. If you stream videos on loop, play graphically intensive games and use the camera on a stretch, you will find the V40 ThinQ struggling to last even for a day with one full charge. The V40 ThinQ is another impressive flagship phone from LG. The brilliant 5-lens camera setup alone gives me enough reasons to recommend this phone to anyone who keeps photography in his/her highest regards. Besides, the vibrant QHD+ OLED screen, super durable design and best-in-class audio setup are some more reasons to invest in this device. However, you just cannot ignore the competition.",By Rohit Arora,"Updated: Tuesday, February 26, 2019, 11:02 [IST]"
1,"Vivo V15 Pro launched at Rs. 28,990: Good, Bad and the X factor",https://www.gizbot.com//mobile/reviews/vivo-v15-pro-launched-at-rs-28-990-good-bad-the-x-factor-057767.html,NA , NA," If you are always clicking selfies and creating stories on Snapchat and Instagram, you will love this phone. The 32MP selfie camera placed on the retractable camera module captures excellent shots. The motorized camera module pops out instantly with a sci-fi sound that itself is enough to turn the heads. Vivo has used a three-lens camera setup which comprises of one 8MP wide-angle lens, 5MP standard lens and the 48MP quad pixel sensor working on a decently sized f/1.8 aperture. The results are pleasing. Images show true to eyes colors and the AI is not very harsh. Unlike Honor's AI mode which is pretty intensive and not always at the point, Vivo is doing a good job in the camera software. The camera takes good portrait shots when light conditions are favorable. The app also offers a dedicated Night mode which can take some well-lit shots if you keep the phone steady. You also get 4K video recording, HDR, Pro mode, and AI beauty even for rear camera mode. Overall, Vivo has offered a feature-rich camera app to please shutterbugs. Vivo V15 Pro sports a big and vibrant AMOLED display with no notch to hamper the viewing experience. The 6.39-inch screen with 19.5:9 aspect ratio offers a screen-to-body ratio of 91.6%. The display is quite vibrant and is surrounded by thin bezels which make gameplay and video playback quite immersive. If you watch a lot of videos and play long game sessions, you will really like this AMOLED panel. Vivo V15 Pro is quite a head-turner. The phone looks and feels premium and can be used with one hand as the buttons are placed at convenient spots. The rear panel of the phone looks rather interesting and sports a gradient pattern. Vivo calls it Spectrum Ripple design and it makes Vivo V15 Pro stand out from the crowd. Vivo V15 Pro is one of the very few smartphones in the year 2019 to offer tow very useful features. The smartphone comes with a dedicated microSD card slot so that you don't need to compromise on storage and connectivity. Moreover, if you still prefer using your old but good wired headphones, you are most welcome as the V15 Pro does not ditch the good old 3.5mm headphone jack. Vivo V15 Pro runs on FunTouch OS which offers a number of useful software features. These features are tucked inside the settings section. These include Game cube which when enabled restricts notifications for a seamless gaming experience. You get DND mode, Motorbike mode which promotes safer riding experience by controlling incoming calls and texts. Besides, you also get Face beauty mode for video call, enable a number of smart motion features, clone applications mirror your phone to other media devices and can even record everything on the screen with Screen capture feature. Vivo V15 Pro is the most technologically advanced smartphone in sub Rs. 30k price-segment; however, the smartphone still lacks the Type-C port. The choice of microUSB 2.0 port seems rather disappointing in the year 2019. As far as fast-charging is concerned, the handset supports Dual-Engine fast charging which is quite effective. The bundled charger can refuel the battery from zero to 25 % in about 15 minutes. While Vivo FunTouch OS is really feature-rich, it is still not the best Android custom skin in the market. If you have been a long-time Stock Android user, this iOS lookalike Android skin will not please you much. However, the choice of Android skin is a matter of personal preference and if you have used a Vivo's smartphone in past, you will not face any issues in the software department on Vivo V15 Pro. Even though Vivo has improved the in-screen fingerprint scanning technology to a good extent, it is still not the most comfortable way to unlock the handset. I found myself struggling with the in-screen fingerprint scanner quite often as the response time and the unlock accuracy is still not at par with the good old physical fingerprint scanners. Vivo V15 Pro seems like the perfect phone for consumers who appreciate new mobile technologies. The phone offers an interesting triple-lens camera setup and a capable 32MP pop up selfie camera that captures excellent selfies. The selfie camera is indeed the X factor of the smartphone.",By Rohit Arora, NA

As it's something the user will interact with the most. And it gets better if you get two screens to play around with. The Vivo NEX 2 certainly feels like a peek into the future and seems like a thoughtful and creative way to do away with the controversial notch. And with features like mirror mode and dual screen gaming, the second display sounds much more useful than being just a gimmick to look different from other smartphones in the much-crowded market.",By Vishal Kawadkar,"Updated: Thursday, February 14, 2019, 17:49 [IST]"
3,OPPO K1 First Impressions: Display and Selfie camera stands out,https://www.gizbot.com//mobile/reviews/oppo-k1-first-impressions-display-selfie-camera-stands-out-057562.html,NA , NA," Let's start with the highlight feature of OPPO K1, which is also the X factor of this handset. OPPO K1 is the most affordable smartphone with an in-screen fingerprint scanner. This can be a feature to flaunt and might give you some attention but the fingerprint scanner is not of the best quality we have seen so far. It was quite easy to setup the in-screen fingerprint scanner but it failed to unlock the handset quite often during our short testing with the device. There's also a noticeable delay in unlocking the handset. OPPO K1 flaunts a 25MP selfie camera, which was able to capture good images during our testing. The camera works on F/2.0 aperture and can also create a software-driven bokeh effect. Images looked crisp and showed good detailing. You also get a variety of filters and modes to improve the selfie output. The camera also uses AI to help you make the most out of massive 25MP selfie shooter. Some images can look animated as AI gets pretty harsh sometimes. Thankfully, you can control the beautification level via on-screen controls. The front camera can record videos in 1080p resolution. While the highlights of OPPO K1 are the in-screen fingerprint scanner and 25mp selfie camera, I found the 6.4-inch Full HD+ AMOLED screen to be the best feature of this handset. OPPO K1 flaunts a Waterdrop notch and offers a very good screen-to-body ratio. The display is slightly reflective but it still makes for a very good panel in this price-point. As it is an AMOLED panel, the videos and games will offer an immersive viewing experience. The screen is also protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5, which is an added bonus. As far as the rear camera is considered, OPPO K1 sports a 16MP + 2 MP dual-lens rear camera setup with AI beautification. The camera can record 4K videos but sadly EIS is not supported. The camera seemed snappy and image output also looked good. The camera supports HDR and the app also offers a number of filters to let you experiment with the shots you capture. The rear camera lets you control the AI Beautification level as per your preference. Besides, you get Portrait mode, Time-lapse, Stockers, Manual mode but sadly there's no built-in Slow-motion mode in OPPO K1. Like most of the smartphones these days, OPPO K1 also comes in a 3D Gradient design. You can choose between two colors- Vivianite Blue and Graphite Black. The smartphone looks appealing and the gradient colors make it quite eye-catchy, but the handset fails to give a premium in-hand feel. The quality of material used to design OPPO K1 feels cheap and the glossy back panel makes OPPO k1 quite slippery. Moreover, due to the big 6.4-inch screen, OPPO K1 is not a perfect fit for one-hand operation. The closest rivals- Redmi Note 6 Pro, Xiaomi Mi A2 and Nokia 7.1 Plus feel far premium than OPPO K1. OPPO K1 is backed by a capable but an underclocked Snapdragon 660 CPU which is combined with 4GB RAM + 64GB internal memory. The handset felt snappy and responsive; however, we are yet to test the handset for its gaming, processing and multitasking performance. The smartphone is powered by a decently sized 3,600 mAh battery unit which in numbers is not as par with the rival devices like Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 and Redmi Note 6 Pro. But the choice of AMOLED screen might work in OPPO K1's favor. There's no Type C port and the handset also does not support fast-charging, which is a big letdown. What's good here is the dedicated microSD card support. You can use two nano SIM cards and a microSD card at the same time. Another disappointment is the dated Android 8.1 Oreo which is accompanied by OPPO's ColorOS 5.2 Operating System. The ColorOS is not our favorite skin as it comes across as highly animated and full of many unwanted apps and software tweaks which might prove as a deal-breaker if you prefer a clean stock Android UI. OPPO K1 has some really good features to offer at Rs. 17k price-point, but the smartphone is not free of disappointments. It boasts a vibrant AMOLED panel which houses an in-screen fingerprint scanner. There's dedicated microSD card support and a capable 25MP selfie shooter. Sadly, there's no Type C port, no fast-charging, dated Android Oreo and the chipset used is an underclocked version of Snapdragon 660. It's too early to give a verdict on the real-life performance of OPPO K1. We will stress test the device to find out its multitasking, battery, gaming and camera performance.

4,"Samsung Galaxy M20 review: A fresh, aggressively priced phone with a massive battery",https://www.gizbot.com//mobile/reviews/samsung-galaxy-m20-review-057397.html,PROS  Sturdy designImpressive displayMassive battery,CONS  Dated softwareUnderwhelming cameraBad fingerprint reader placement," Â  Well, looks aren't the biggest highlight of the Galaxy M20. Samsung has used a hard plastic rear which makes the phone resistant to accidental drops. While the front panel looks beautiful, the rear is the exact opposite. The back panel has a boring design and acts as a fingerprint magnet, thanks to its glossy nature. It also houses a fingerprint sensor which has an awkward placement and we often found ourselves reaching out for the fingerprint sensor. It feels a bit uncomfortable and not suitable for someone with small palms. Samsung has used its Infinity U display for the new Galaxy M20. Although the display doesn't feature a Super AMOLED but do not get fooled by the TFT panel, as it makes for a great viewing experience. You might not get to see the dark blacks on the new panel, but that's forgivable considering the price of the device. The bezels are also pretty slim which makes this display ideal for multimedia consumption. Optics-wise, the Galaxy M20 comes equipped with a dual rear camera setup that packs a 13MP sensor with F1.9 aperture and a 5MP ultra-wide lens. The dual camera setup is complemented by an LED flash. While the 13MP is the primary sensor, the 5MP sensor lets you take ultra-wide shots at 120-angles, compared to the normal 78-angles offered by other devices in this price segment. Under the hood Exynos 7904 1.8Ghz octa-core chipset paired with 4GB of RAM. We were satisfied with the performance of the Galaxy M20. It managed to perform day-to-day tasks without breaking a sweat and the app launch and switching were swift. We hardly noticed any kind of lag and stutter, however, we did feel that the device gets a bit toasty when firing up some graphics-heavy games. But the mild games work like a charm on this device, thanks to the Mali-G71 GPU. With the Galaxy M20, Samsung seems to have introduced a much-needed budget device for its sales. As the company plans to lock horns with the Chinese compatitors, it needs to have a powerful, feature-rich device in the segment, and the Galaxy M20 checks almost all the boxes. It comes with a brilliant display, a long-lasting battery life, and a sturdy build. Starting at Rs 10,990, it is Samsung's most aggressively priced device till date.",By Vishal Kawadkar,"Updated: Wednesday, February 6, 2019, 12:32 [IST]"
5,Samsung Galaxy M10 review: Big on display and battery backup,https://www.gizbot.com//mobile/reviews/samsung-galaxy-m10-review-big-on-display-battery-backup-057385.html,PROS  Big and colorful displayEasy to operate with single handLong battery back up,CONS  Display lacks a bit in clarityAverage camera performance," Samsung Galaxy M10 is a big smartphone which is encased within a shiny polycarbonate body. The rear panel of Galaxy M10 looks pretty basic and houses only the primary camera setup stacked vertically at the top left corner. You get the Samsung branding at the center of the rear panel where the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner is usually mounted. The glossy rear panel does pick up fingerprints over a period of time and you will need to keep on cleaning the surface. Therefore, we would suggest you use a case with it. The display up front is tall and takes up most of the space with minimal bezels around it. There is a teardrop notch at the top center that houses the front camera. Samsung is calling this panel as Infinity-V display and it is a part of the recently introduced Infinity display panels by the company. Let's have a look at the camera specifications at first. The Galaxy M10 sports a dual-lens primary camera setup that has a 13MP primary sensor with an f/1.9 aperture combined with a secondary 5MP Ultra-wide sensor with f/2.2 aperture. There is a 5MP camera at the front that captures selfies and is used for video calls. The Galaxy M10 smartphone comes with an Exynos 7870 chipset under the hood which is a mid-range chipset by the company. The processor is based on 14nm architecture and it clocks at 1.6GHz. You can select the smartphone from two different variants including a 2GB/16GB variant and a 3GB/32GB variant. The storage is expandable up to 512GB via a dedicated microSD card. With Galaxy M10, you don't need to compromise on storage and connectivity. Samsung has used an older Android 8.1 Oreo version to deploy its latest Experience 9.5 UI. While the underlying software is a bit dated, Samsung's UI makes for smooth user experience. The UI is clean and neat with no unwanted clutter at sight. To pull up the app drawer, you just need to swipe up or down on any home screen. Apps open up quickly and the phone doesn't lag while navigating from screen to other. The settings menu is neatly laid out and offers some useful features like One-handed mode, gestures, Smart alert, Dual-Messenger and a lot more. Samsung has really improved the software experience and the new Galaxy M series is not less than any premium smartphone in the software department. The Galaxy M10 is fueled by a small 3,400mAh Li-Ion battery unit which is non-removable. There is no fast charging support with the device and it takes well over 2 hours for the device to charge from zero to 100 percent. As for the backup, the device retains its juice for more than half a day with a single charge. If you are performing basic tasks such as calling, internet surfing, and casual video and audio playback, you might not need to plug in the device twice. However, if you use the device extensively for heavy gaming and continuous high-res. Video/audio playback, you will need to plug the device again or simply keep a power bank handy. The new Galaxy M series by Samsung is a big step up from the company's previous budget smartphones. It is a perfect budget smartphone for consumers who were eagerly waiting for a feature-packed performance driven budget smartphone from a trusted brand like Samsung. This handset will definitely create some big troubles for Xiaomi, Honor, Asus, and Realme in the Indian market.",By Sandeep Sarkar,"Updated: Wednesday, February 6, 2019, 10:25 [IST]"
6,Asus ROG Phone review: More than a flagship smartphone,https://www.gizbot.com//mobile/reviews/asus-rog-phone-review-more-than-flagship-smartphone-057178.html,PROS  Vivid high-refresh rate OLED displaySpeed-binned Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoCDual front-facing stereo speaker setupFast charging,CONS  Expensiveno microSD card slot," Display: 2160 x 1080 pixels FHD+ 90Hz refresh rateSoC: Qualcomm Speed-binned Snapdragon 845 with Adreno 630 GPURAM: 8 GBROM: 128 GBPrimary camera: 12 MP + 8 MP (Super wide-angle)Selfie camera: 8 MPBattery: 4000 mAh with fast charging support (30W)Water resistance: IPX4 splash proofCooling solution: 3D Vapor-Chamber CoolingSound: Dual stereo speaker setupLighting: ASUS Aurasync RGB LightingSIM slot: Dual nano-SIM slot The Asus ROG Phone is one of the unique looking smartphones in the market. The amalgamation of the glass and metal build gives a unique look to the smartphone and also offers better heat dissipation. The Asus ROG Phone, hands down has the best display that I have seen in the recent past. The ROG Phone has a 6.0-inch OLED display with 18:9 aspect ratio, offering 2160 x 1080p resolution, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 6. The Asus ROG Phone has an 8 MP selfie camera on the front and a dual primary camera setup with a 12 MP RGB sensor and an 8 MP Super wide-angle lens. The camera setup on the ROG Phone is identical to the Asus ZenFone 5z, the affordable flagship smartphone from Asus. Coming to the actual camera performance, the ROG Phone can capture good looking images with great details in the daylight condition. What amazed me is the fact that the camera performance on the ROG Phone is identical to the ZenFone 5z, which costs 1/3rd of the price of the ROG Phone. The images taken on low-lighting conditions tend to deteriorate in color and details. In some instance, the camera struggles to capture enough details, again with contrast to other high-end smartphones at this price point. In fact, Poco F1 can take better pictures in low-light situations compared to the ROG Phone. Same goes for the selfie camera as well, which works like a charm in the well-lit environment, and struggles in the low-light condition. Without a doubt, the Asus ROG Phone is one of the most powerful Android smartphones with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC. The smartphone is powered by a speed-binned Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC, where the four high-performance cores are clocked at 2.96 GHz with Adreno 630 GPU. Asus has created a new profile to enhance the gaming performance of the ROG Phone, called X Mode. X Mode is similar to the game-boost mode, which is generally found on other smartphones, which free-up the CPU, GPU, and RAM and channelize everything to the game or app that is opened at the time. Here are the Geekbench results with X Mode and without X Mode. On single core CPU performance, the device scores 2531 on X Mode and 2483 points on normal mode. Here are the AnTuTu results with x Mode and without X Mode. The ROG Phone scores an overall score of 254695 points on X Mode and 252504 points on normal mode. With respect to GPU performance, the devices score 126122 points on X Mode and 126061 points on normal mode. The ROG Phone has a massive 4000 mAh battery. The speed binned Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 does impact the battery performance, where I ended up charging the device at least twice a day with normal usage (surfing web, YouTube, and social media). Keeping aside the gaming-phone concept, the Asus ROG Phone is a perfect flagship smartphone. IPX4 water-resistance certification, super-fast charging, 3.5mm headphone jack with a dedicated DAC, faster chipset with 8 GB RAM and 128 GB internal storage are just some of the highlight features of the smartphone. A gaming smartphone powered by Android OS cannot get better than the ROG Phone at this point. It has the fastest chipset (at the time of launch), one of a kind OLED display with 90Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time. The smartphone ships with AeroActive cooling add-on, which helps to sustain peak performance for an extended period of time.",By Vivek,"Updated: Tuesday, January 29, 2019, 15:09 [IST]"
7,Samsung Galaxy M10 First Impressions: Finally a budget Galaxy to take on Chinese smartphones,https://www.gizbot.com//mobile/reviews/samsung-galaxy-m10-first-impressions-finally-budget-galaxy-smartphone-in-market-057164.html,NA , NA," Samsung Galaxy M10 looks and feels good in hands but offers nothing special in terms of overall design. The device is made out of plastic which appears to be slightly low in quality but it can take a beating and can survive some falls from low height. Samsung Galaxy M10 boasts a tall 6.22-inch Infinity-V display panel that offers HD+ resolution. Just to recall, Samsung has released its new display panels including the Infinity-O, Infinity-V and Infinity U display back in 2018. You get a waterdrop notch on the top of the display that accommodates the front camera of the device to captures selfies and for video calls. Samsung Galaxy M10 runs on an octa-core Exynos 7870 chipset which is a mid-range processor by the South Korean tech giant. The processor onboard is based on 14nm architecture and it clocks at 1.6GHz. There is a 3GB of RAM that takes care of all the multitasking. In terms of storage, the device offers a total internal space of 32GB which you can expand later to up to 512GB via an external microSD card slot. In the software department, the Galaxy M10 ships with Android 8.1.0 Oreo out-of-the-box based on Samsung Experience 9.5 skin on top. The device offers a neat UI which is easy to operate and gives a smooth user experience. The Galaxy M10 might also receive the Android Pie update in August this year. This was reported earlier by the Samsung Members app and the update could be announced in the coming months. The new Experience UI is smooth and works just fine for most of the part. The Galaxy M10 sports a dual-lens rear camera panel that comprises a 13MP primary sensor that has an f/1.9 aperture paired with a 5MP secondary Ultra-wide sensor that has an f/2.2 aperture. To capture selfies and for video calls, the device uses a 5MP selfie camera that has an aperture of f/2.0. Backing up the Galaxy M10 is a decent 3,400mAh non-removable Li-Ion battery unit. With a single charge and moderate usage, the device lasts more than half a day. You get a standard 5V charger in the box which takes around 2 hours to charge the smartphone completely. We will test the battery of the device with extensive tasks and will check how long it lasts. Stay tuned with us to read a detailed review of the latest affordable smartphone by Samsung. Samsung has up the game in the affordable segment with the release of Galaxy M lineup. Both the Galaxy M10 and the Galaxy M20 offers some impressive set of specifications and features which makes them a good rival against the other affordable smartphones such as the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro, Redmi Note 6 Pro, ZenFone Max Pro M2, and others. Both the devices are a sweet deal for the price range they are selling for. Like we mentioned earlier, we will use the smartphone thoroughly so that we can share our comprehensive review with you.",By Sandeep Sarkar,"Updated: Monday, January 28, 2019, 20:49 [IST]"
8,"Samsung Galaxy M20: The Good, The Bad, and The X Factor",https://www.gizbot.com//mobile/reviews/samsung-galaxy-m20-the-good-the-bad-the-x-factor-057163.html,NA , NA," Beautiful yet sturdy Samsung hasn't used its signature Super AMOLED panel on the Galaxy M20 in favor of a normal 6.3-inch LCD panel. Although it might sound downgraded, the display panel comes with a Full HD resolution which makes for an impressive viewing experience. You might miss the dark blacks on the S AMOLED panels, but that's forgivable considering the price of the device. The Samsung Galaxy M20 is fueled by a huge 5000mAh battery. The battery sure lives up to the expectations one would have. We managed to use the device for a whole day, and the phone still managed to save 26 percent of juice. The brilliant battery performance is complemented by the company's fast charging tech. The Galaxy M20 takes a little over one hour to fully charge. You can also get a few hours of talk time by charging it for 15-20 minutes. Bringing the fast charging tech to the Galaxy M20 is something to be appreciated, as not many devices come with this functionality in this price range. Dated software The Galaxy M20 comes equipped with a dual rear camera that comprises a 13MP + 5MP sensors along with an LED flash. The 13MP is the primary lens, while the 5MP sensor allows you to capture ultra-wide shots at 120-degree angles compared to the normal 78-degree angles seen on other smartphones. The Galaxy M20 features a fingerprint sensor housed on the rear panel of the phone. But due to the large form factor of the phone, we often found ourselves reaching out for the fingerprint sensor. It feels a bit uncomfortable and if you are someone who has small palms, you wouldn't want to go through this process to unlock your Galaxy M20. Aggressive pricing Samsung has offered a well-rounded smartphone at an affordable price, making it a great value for money. The user response is yet to be seen, but in our opinion, the company has finally taken the right path with its latest M series of smartphones and should continue to bring more and more products that cost less but don't compromise on the specifications front.",By Vishal Kawadkar,"Updated: Monday, January 28, 2019, 19:47 [IST]"

It is probably the best looking smartphone Micromax has ever produced at this price. It comes in three color variants - Viola, Blue Lagoon, Velvet Red, and we got the blue variant for review. In terms of aesthetics, the Infinity N12 is one of the most good looking devices in this price segment. It is probably the best looking smartphone Micromax has ever produced at this price. It comes in three color variants - Viola, Blue Lagoon, Velvet Red, and we got the blue variant for review. Speaking of the display, the Infinity N12 packs a 6.19-inch HD+ display with a 720 x 1520 pixel resolution and an aspect ratio of 18:9. We wouldn't call this the best display in this price segment, but it still makes for an average viewing experience. The smartphone comes equipped with a dual rear camera setup that comprises 13MP + 5MP sensors backed by an LED flash. The company claims to have integrated the cameras with artificial intelligence. The camera app is really easy to use, and switching between the modes works like a charm. Under the hood, the Micromax Infinity N12 is powered by a 2GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio P22 processor paired with 3GB of RAM. It has 32GB of internal storage capacity, which is expandable using a MIcroSD card. Overall, the Micromax Infinity N12 qualifies as a decent smartphone, however, the company will have to do something extra to lock horns with aggressively priced Chinese smartphone brands.",By Vishal Kawadkar,"Updated: Monday, January 21, 2019, 11:55 [IST]"
10,Asus ZenFone Max M2 Review: Good battery life and stock Android but underwhelming cameras,https://www.gizbot.com//mobile/reviews/asus-zenfone-max-m2-review-good-battery-life-and-stock-android-056892.html,PROS  Robust buildDecent hardwareStock AndroidGood Battery Back up,CONS  Average CameraDisplay Maxes out at 720 pixels," The ZenFone Max M2 looks identical to ZenFone Max Pro M2 smartphone. The device is big and has a notched display up front. Unlike the Max Pro M2, Zenfone Max M2 has a metallic rear panel with matte finish held by a plastic frame. The matte finish gives the device a premium look and it hardly picks up fingerprints which further reduces the need of cases. The Asus ZenFone Max M2 comes with a big IPS LCD display panel that measures 6.3-inches and offers a screen resolution of 720 x 1520 pixels. The display has an aspect ratio of 19:9. The display resolution is pretty standard what we see in the affordable smartphones these days. The IPS LCD screen sports a notch on top, similar to the ZenFone Max Pro M2 that houses the front camera paired with an LED flash along with a bunch of sensors including the notification LED. The Asus ZenFone Max M2 sports a dual-lens rear camera module that comprises a 13MP primary sensor with an f/1.8 aperture accompanied by a 2MP secondary lens used for depth sensing. To capture selfies and for video calls, the device features an 8MP front snapper that has an aperture of f/2.0. The ZenFone Max M2 makes use of an octa-core Snapdragon 632 chipset which is paired with 3/4GB of RAM to take care of the multitasking. This is a significant upgrade from the usual Snapdragon 430 chipset which the predecessor of this device the ZenFone Max M1 packs. The Snapdragon 632 chipset is the recent entry-segment processor which Qualcomm had announced back in June 2018 and it brings over 40 percent improvements over the Snapdragon 626 SoC. The device does not lag while carrying out day-to-day tasks such as web surfing, calling and some light gameplay. Also, we did not experience any noticeable device heating issues with this handset. Just like its sibling, the ZenFone Max M2 also packs a big battery unit. It comes with a 4,000mAh non-removable battery which is bundled with a 10W charging adapter. The battery backup of the device is quite impressive. The device gives a backup of over a day with a single charge and easy-moderate usage such as surfing the internet or watching movies and with some light gameplay which is quite impressive. With extensive usage, you might need to plug the smartphone again towards the end of the day. The ZenFone Max M2 is a good entry-segment smartphone which not only carries a reasonable price tag but also offers some decent specifications. The device carries a price tag of Rs 9,999 for the 3GB RAM with 32GB storage variant and Rs 11,999 for the 4GB RAM and 64GB storage variant. At this price point, the device competes with Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro, Honor 9N, Realme 2 and others. The device is a perfect deal if you are looking for stock Android, good design and a long-lasting battery backup.",By Sandeep Sarkar,"Updated: Friday, January 18, 2019, 10:16 [IST]"
11,Mobiistar X1 Notch: A good offering in the budget segment,https://www.gizbot.com//mobile/reviews/mobiistar-x1-notch-good-offering-the-budget-segment-056870.html,PROS  Beautiful designDecent selfie cameraAverage performance,CONS  Old softwareBit overpriced," Â  Aesthetically, the Mobiistar X1 Notch will surely catch some eyes. It looks premium, thanks to glass finish on the rear panel which is actually plastic. But, the phone actually feels good to hold with rounded edges that make the gripping easy. The smartphone sports a 5.7-inch display with HD+ resolution and 292ppi. We were a bit disappointed by the thick bezels and a big notch, but that's forgivable considering this is a budget smartphone. On the software front, the Mobiistar X1 Notch runs on Android 8.1 Oreo with company's skin atop. The device gives a near-stock experience and works smoothly. The X1 Notch comes equipped with a 13MP rear camera accompanied by an LED flash. The company claims that the camera is powered by artificial intelligence and will set the colors according to the scene in the frame. Under the hood, the device is powered by a 2GHz quad-core MediaTek Helio A22 chipset paired with 3GB of RAM and 16GB/32GB internal storage which is expandable up to 128GB using a microSD card. Overall, the Mobiistar X1 Notch is a good smartphone for the much-crowded budget segment. You might feel that the device is a bit overpriced for the specifications, but since it's targetted to the offline market, it makes for a good value for money.",By Vishal Kawadkar,"Updated: Friday, January 18, 2019, 10:31 [IST]"
12,Honor 10 Lite Review: Good at almost everything,https://www.gizbot.com//mobile/reviews/honor-10-lite-review-good-at-almost-everything-056864.html,PROS  Premium design at a budget priceCrisp edge-to-edge screen with a tiny notchSmooth performanceHandles games pretty wellLatest Android 9.0Best-in-class Night mode in this price segment,"CONS  No Fast chargingFingerprint magnet, gathers scratches easilyBattery life could have been betterUnderwhelming camera and audio performance"," Honor 10 Lite sports a 6.21-inch screen offering Full HD+ (1080p x 2340p) resolution. The handset runs the company's EMUI deployed on latest Android Pie OS. For the camera, Honor 10 Lite features a 24MP selfie camera and a 13MP + 2MP dual-lens rear camera setup. The smartphone is backed by the company's in-house Kirin 710 chipset paired with 4GB and 6GB RAM configuration. For storage and battery, Honor 10 Lite offers 64GB internal memory with microSD card support (up to 512GB) and is powered by a 3,400 mAh battery unit. The first thing that most of us notice while buying a smartphone is the design and how the phone actually feels in hands. Having said that for a smartphone priced at Rs. , Honor 10 Lite is a looker. It is crafted beautifully and doesn't come across as a budget device. Honor 10 Lite can be used with one hand as the handset is very lightweight and ergonomic. Honor has done a wonderful job of packing a massive screen in such a compact form-factor, thanks to Chip-on-Film technology and 1.8mm bezels on sides of the screen. Some key design elements that make Honor 10 Lite the best-looking budget smartphone are; Dewdrop notch, massive all-screen front, gradient color, and the 3D curved edge design. The only design letdown is the glossy back panel that is a fingerprint magnet and also catches scratches easily. The Midnight Black variant I am using has already gathered multiple scratches at the back panel. Make sure you use the handset with the bundled clear case in the package if you want to avoid any damage to your phone. The power button and volume rockers are placed on the right side of the handset and offer satisfactory tactile feedback. The fingerprint scanner is also placed at the sweet spot for a struggle-free unlocking experience. The big 6.21-inch Full HD+ display makes Honor 10 Lite a good device to stream videos and to play games. The 91% screen-to-body ratio makes video streaming and gameplay quite a delight. Honor has used an IPS LCD panel which is bright and crisp; however, it is not as vibrant as the screen on Redmi Note 6 Pro. Therefore, the gameplay and video playback lacks a certain punch which makes the viewing experience more immersive. I also noticed a slight bluish tint while using the screen for everyday purpose. I would recommend using the phone with the vivid mode (Under Display settings) for videos, gameplay and even for regular use. As I have mentioned in my first impressions of the smartphone, Honor 10 Lite is the company's first smartphone to boast AI in both front and rear cameras. There's a massive 24MP selfie camera with Sony IMX 576 sensor and a 13MP + 2MP rear camera setup. Honor has added a lot of AI in the cameras. The front camera can recognize more than 200 scenarios across 8 categories. The rear camera can recognize over 500 scenes in 22 categories and can automatically apply the best settings for a perfect shot. Does this make Honor 10 Lite a great budget camera phone? The answer is No. The camera performance is rather underwhelming. The AI implementation is pretty good but the end results are mostly average. What this means is that the camera is quite smart at understanding different elements in the frame such as Blue Sky, Greenery, Flowers, Beach, Stage performance, Night, Indoor and Snowscapes but the images just don't turn out good. The images shot by the rear camera in daylight are very crisp and show good detailing but the software is too harsh at bringing out sharpness. The end result can be pretty animated. The AI mode helps to some extent but then it has a tendency to saturate the colors. Some shots even show bluish tint. Portrait shots are pretty good for the budget price-point but show some inconsistent blurring at various spots. There's no 4K video recording and 1080p at 30fps videos are very shaky as the phone doesn't support OIS. What's good is the newly added â€˜Night mode'. The shots are vibrant and show impressive detailing. Images show significant noise but clarity is where shots stand out. You can read more about Honor 10 Lite's camera in my detailed comparison of the handset with Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 and Redmi Note 6 Pro. Honor 10 Lite is the first sub 15k handset by Honor to be powered by the in-house Kirin 710 chipset. On papers, the processing unit delivers 75% better speed and 130% boost in graphical performance when compared to company's Kirin 659 CPU. Honor 10 Lite also gets GPU Turbo Tech 2.0 which ideally should improve the gaming performance of the handset. In real life, this budget smartphone feels really snappy. Even the games ran smoothly and there were far fewer jitters during gameplay when compared to the company's previous budget handsets. Game titles like Shadow Fight 3, Guns of Boom ran without any lags. The handset even managed to run graphically intensive game Asphalt 9 pretty smoothly. You will not face any issues with everyday tasks like calling, video streaming, photo-editing and while running multiple applications at a time. Overall, Honor 10 Lite offered slightly better user experience when compared to Redmi Note 6 Pro and Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, the handset's biggest rivals. On the software side, the smartphone runs on EMUI 9 based on the latest Android Pie. While there are not any major differences between EMUI 8 and EMUI 9 in terms of UI and features, the latest iteration of Google OS adds some useful software features like Digital Wellbeing and Gestures navigation. Digital Well-being is a great tool to keep a track of your smartphone usage. It offers important insights like hours spent on individual apps, screen-on time and a lot more. Gestures navigation feels half-baked on Honor 10 Lite but delivers a seamless full-screen user experience. Software, display, and cameras are really important but what truly makes or breaks a phone is battery life, call quality, and connectivity features. For battery backup, Honor 10 Lite draws its power from a 3,400 mAh battery unit which is considerably smaller than the standards set by Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 and Redmi Note series handsets. In my testing, the handset rarely managed to last for one full day. I had to refuel the battery cell twice a day and you would also need to do the same if you stream videos, play games and click a lot of pictures. And sadly, the handset does not support fast charging. If battery life is your number one priority, look for other options. Honor 10 Lite offers a premium in-hand feel and works brilliantly as a multimedia device, thanks to the crisp 6.21-inch edge-to-edge display with a tiny notch at center. At a starting price of Rs. 13,999, the smartphone also offers the latest Android OS and a snappy chipset. However, if the camera and battery life qualify as your major priorities, I would recommend the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro.",By Rohit Arora,"Updated: Wednesday, January 16, 2019, 14:42 [IST]"

The all-screen design and sleek form-factor make this handset look really eye-catchy. The display is fairly bright and vibrant making Honor 10 Lite a good budget smartphone for multimedia lovers. I streamed 1080p videos on this handset and even played some graphically rich game titles. The gameplay and video playback experience were good as the 91% screen-to-body ratio completely fills up the display for an impressive viewing experience. Honor10 Lite is the company's first smartphone to boast AI in both front and rear cameras. The smartphone sports a massive 24MP selfie camera with Sony IMX 576 sensor. The camera can recognize recognizes more than 200 scenarios across 8 categories. What this means is that the camera can quickly customize the basic settings to better capture different elements in the frame such as Blue Sky, Greenery, Flowers, Beach, Stage performance, Night, Indoor and Snowscapes. As far as the rear camera is concerned, Honor 10 Lite sports a dual-lens camera- 13MP + 2MP system working on f/1.8 and f/2.4 aperture lenses respectively. As per Honor, the rear camera can recognize over 500 scenes in 22 categories and can automatically apply the best settings for a perfect shot. The AI works quite well on the camera systems and you can capture some crisp and detailed shots in daylight. I am not entirely blown away with the results in indoor and low-light conditions though. Pictures captured in standard â€˜Photo' mode by front and rear cameras show noise and softer details. Portrait shots show some inconsistent blurring on non-human subjects. Honor 10 Lite offers some solid on-paper specs. The smartphone runs on EMUI 9 based on the latest Android Pie. It is backed by Huawei's in-house Kirin 710 octa-core CPU. The company will unveil 4GB and 6GB RAM variants with 64GB in-built storage that can be expanded to up to 512GB via microSD card. I am currently testing the 4GB RAM variant and it feels really snappy. Even the heavy games ran smoothly as the handset ships with GPU Turbo 2.0 that improves the graphical performance. Android 9 combined with EMUI 9 offers some useful features such as Digital balance, Password Vault, Ride mode, Smart assistance, etc. While everything else seems just top-notch, Honor 10 Lite is backed by a humble 3,400 mAh battery unit which seems less beefy when compared with rival devices like Redmi Note 6 Pro (4,000 mAh) and Asus Zenfone Max pro M2 (5,000 mAh). However, Honor says that the battery on Honor 10 Lite can actually offer the same level of battery backup due to handset's efficient antenna design and hardware-software customization. We will compare the battery life of Honor 10 Lite with that of Redmi and Asus handsets to test such claims. Honor 10 Lite has managed to impress us in a short period of time. It seems like a well-rounded budget smartphone for consumers who don't want to compromise on design, display and software part. We are yet to fully evaluate the handset's camera, battery and multitasking performance.

15,Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 review: Most feature-rich and spec-heavy budget smartphone,https://www.gizbot.com//mobile/reviews/asus-zenfone-max-pro-m2-review-most-feature-rich-spec-heavy-budget-056626.html,PROS  Big display Snappy ProcessorBig on battery,CONS  Rear panel is a fingerprint magnetAverage camera performance," For a smartphone that comes at a starting price of Rs. 12,999, Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 looks quite appealing. It offers a smooth design layout with nothing fancy all around. The device features an all-plastic casing with a glossy rear panel. At first look, the rear panel appears to be made out of glass, however, let the looks not fool you. It is only when you hold the phone in hands that you will realize it is an all-plastic construction. Keep the Redmi Note 6 Pro or Nokia 6.1 Plus side by side and you will instantly feel the difference. Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 feels somewhat less premium in hands. However, the plastic construction doesn't affect the device's ability to resist damage. Instead, Zenfone Max Pro M2 might be one of the most durable budget smartphones in the market. The phone fell from my hands twice on a hard surface and it did not suffer any noticeable damage. The front of the handset features Corning Gorilla Glass 6 making Zenfone Max Pro M2 the most affordable handset with the latest and toughest glass from Corning. Even with a big display panel and a massive battery unit, I didn't find the device bulkier. It is somewhat easy to operate the smartphone with one hand; however, reaching the edges might need some efforts. The curved edges allow for a good grip, though, we would suggest you use a case as the glossy rear panel is slightly slippery. Overall, ZenFone Max Pro M2 features a sturdy design which might not give the most premium feel in hands but somehow looks premium due to its glossy plastic back and minimal looks. Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 sports a tall 6.3-inch full HD+ IPS display panel that has an aspect ratio of 19:9. The screen offers a resolution of 1080 x 2280 pixels and a peak brightness of 450 nits. The display sports a mid-size notch on top which stores the front camera along with an LED flash and a couple of sensors. It also has a notification LED which glows orange when the device is being charged and green for general notifications. Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 packs a dual-lens rear camera setup like most of the affordable smartphones available in the market. The rear camera module comprises of a 12MP primary Sony IMX486 sensor that has an aperture value of f/1.8. The camera is paired with a 5MP depth sensing secondary lens. The camera also fails to capture real-life colors in low-lighting and also show noise. The primary lens delivers warm colors if light sources are placed close and simply fails to differentiate the color difference in light sources placed farther. The images also look washed out in low-light conditions. Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro did a better job in similar conditions. The major highlight besides the big battery of the ZenFone Max Pro M2 is the stock Android UI. The neat UI offers a smooth user experience and is not gimmicky. If Asus manages to offer timely updates, this device can be the best affordable option or stock Android fans. Being a stock Android phone, Zenfone Max Pro M2 only offers some stock Google apps. It runs on Android 8.1 Oreo, though, the company has promised an Android Pie update for the device. As for the hardware, you get a Snapdragon 660 chipset onboard which is combined with Adreno 512 GPU to render all the high-resolution graphics and it does a pretty good job while doing the same. Notably, the processor is powerful than what one of its major rivals the Redmi Note 6 Pro offers. The Redmi Note 6 Pro comes with a Snapdragon 636 chipset and is selling for a similar price point. So, you get a snappier Snapdragon chipset which is clubbed with 3/4/6 GB of RAM for multitasking. The ZenFone Max Pro M2 houses a mammoth 5,000mAh battery unit; sadly, there is no fast charging support. This means you will need to wait a while to get the fuel back up. Speaking of the charging speed, the device takes around 2.5 hours to charge from zero to 100 percent. A lesser charge time would have been really appreciated. ZenFone Max Pro M2 is a worthy successor to the ZenFone Max Pro M1. It is durable, runs stock Android and also offers best-in-class CPU. The smartphone also offers a dedicated microSD card slot and packs in the beefiest battery in the budget price-point. It is only the camera performance, where the smartphone failed to impress us. Competitors like Redmi Note 6 pro and Honor 8X are better camera devices in the overall camera performance. Having said that, if you are looking for a budget smartphone with long-lasting battery life, no-compromise in storage and connectivity, durable design and stock Android, Zenfone Max Pro M2 is the answer. If the camera is your top priority, you should check out the other mid-rangers such as the Redmi Note 6 Pro and Honor 8X.",By Sandeep Sarkar,"Updated: Friday, January 18, 2019, 11:10 [IST]"

The body is entirely made of plastic, unlike the latter which uses metal construction. he left side has the dual-SIM slot which can also accommodate a microSD card, while the right side packs volume rockers and power button. On the top, there's a 3.5mm audio jack and the bottom holds the speakers and MicroUSB port. Speaking of the display, the smartphone comes with a 5.7-inch IPS LCD display that has a resolution of 1440 x 720 pixels, and a pixel density of 282 PPI. The display qualifies as a decent one which can register 10 fingers simultaneously. It is scratch resistant, but there's no mention of a Gorilla Glass from the company. The software on the Meizu m6T is probably its weakest point. It still runs the dated Android 7.0 Nougat which is wrapped under the FlymeOS skin. The UI doesn't offer an app drawer which is fluid most of the times. And, thanks to the FlymeOS, you get a lot of customization options. Though the m6T isn't a flagship device, it still offers a good camera module for its price. The smartphone comes equipped with a dual camera setup that comprises of a 13MP and a 2MP sensors. The Meizu m6T is powered by a MediaTek's MT6750 octa-core processor paired with 3GB/4GB RAM and 32GB/64GB internal storage which is expandable up to 128GB using a microSD card. The processor here is an upgrade of MT6737 which supports 1080p video decoding. But, since there's no Full-HD display here, it doesn't really make a lot of difference. The company could have used a Snapdragon 430 or Helio P23 instead. Overall, the Meizu m6T is a potent smartphone in the budget segment. The company has surely made a good comeback in the Indian market. The features this device offers makes it a good value for money. It comes with a good set of cameras, the UI is well optimized, battery life is impressive, and the overall experience is smooth.",By Vishal Kawadkar,"Updated: Friday, January 18, 2019, 10:45 [IST]"

The smartphone comes with an all-plastic body, which has been given a glossy finish at the rear panel. Despite the plastic body, OPPO A7 does not come across as a cheap looking phone, and in fact looks premium than some of its competitors. The back panel has curved edges and sides to give the big phone some level of ergonomics. OPPO A7 boasts a tall 6.2-inch HD+ display panel. The display offers an aspect ratio of 19:9 and has a resolution of 720 x 1520 pixels with a pixel density of 271 PPI. There is a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top for added screen protection. The display is quite vibrant and responsive; however, it is not as crisp as the 1080p displays offered by competitors such as Redmi Note 6 Pro, Honor 8X and Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2. OPPO A7 sports a dual-lens rear camera setup which comprises of a 13MP primary sensor that has an f/2.2 aperture and a 2MP depth sensor with a darker f/2.4 aperture value. The rear camera is paired with LED flashlight. Coming onto the picture quality captured by the rear camera, the images show acceptable detailing in favorable lighting conditions. Color look natural and the camera also feels snappy. You also get a good range of filters and effects to experiment with the images you capture. OPPO A7 may not be the best camera smartphone out there in this price segment, but it definitely is an impressive snapper. The colors captured by the rear camera are balanced and it doesn't animate the images. The bokeh effect produced by the rear camera is also impressive considering that there is just a 2MP sensor for depth sensing. The rear snapper can record 1080p videos at 30fps. However, when it comes to capturing images in challenging light situations the output produced is not that impressive. The camera struggles while capturing images in low-light situations and the output is not up to the mark. Redmi Note 6 Pro and Honor 8X are clearly better camera handsets in this price-point. OPPO A7 draws its power from Qualcomm's entry-segment Snapdragon 450 processor clocked at 1.8GHz which is a letdown considering the price point it is selling for. OPPO A7 is a mid-tier segment device; therefore, a mid-range Qualcomm processor such as the Snapdragon 610 or Snapdragon 635 would have made more sense. The processor onboard is further paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage. The inbuilt storage on the smartphone is expandable up to 25GB via microSD card slot. The smartphone is fuelled by a big 4,230mAh non-removable Li-Ion battery unit with no fast charging support. The device does give a stellar performance when it comes to the battery backup. The Oppo A7 lasts for an entire day with moderate to heavy usage and you will not need to plug in the device twice in a day to refuel the battery. As it misses on the Quick Charge support, it takes over two hours to charge the smartphone from zero percent to 100 percent, which is a letdown. OPPO A7 is a mid-range smartphone that carries a price tag of Rs. 16,990 but packs entry-level processor and a subpar screen. At this price range, other smartphones such as Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, Nokia 6.1 Plus, Honor 8X, etc. offer better cameras and faster processors. It is very tough to recommend this smartphone as competitors are fat better overall mid-range handsets.",By Sandeep Sarkar, NA

These products usually end up being collectibles and are taken with huge interest and excitement over their standard counterparts. Kudos to OnePlus team here as they have kept the trend going on since last few generations of OnePlus flagship phones. It all started with OnePlus 5T Star Wars edition phone followed by OnePlus 6 Marvel Avengers edition and now McLaren edition for the OnePlus 6T. OnePlus 6T McLaren edition might not be the most unique looking flagship phone out there; however, it is still a one-of-its-kind product that will please McLaren fans around the globe. The special edition phone is an instant conversation starter, something I have experienced personally while using the handset. Smartphone enthusiasts and OnePlus fan-boys just couldn't stop themselves from asking questions and admiring the handset. Everyone wanted to experience the device in their own hands. A person in flight even offered his brand new Google Pixel 2 XL in exchange to the review unit I was carrying. Not kidding! When compared with the standard OnePlus 6T, you will find some elemental design changes in the new McLaren edition. The form-factor, dimensions, and the overall weight are exactly the same but the rear panel on the new McLaren edition OnePlus 6T flaunts reflective orange stripes that give the phone its unique personality. OnePlus has used the signature McLaren color, Papaya Orange. The overall Orange-Black color scheme looks very subtle yet eye-catchy. These vibrant Orange stripes flow from the bottom and fade into Black towards the top, exactly at the point where you see the OnePlus logo. Then you will find the â€˜McLaren logo' positioned at the bottom of the phone. The glass at the back panel houses a pattern underneath, which is fused inside the glass with some complex engineering processes. The striking pattern is based on McLaren's choice of carbon fiber material, which is said to be at the heart of all McLaren cars' manufacturing process since 1981. McLaren fans will instantly recognize it and they are the ones that would not think twice while buying this special edition OnePlus 6T. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with this handset. It is super responsive and I never felt the need to kill a single active application in the background. As I have tested the 6GB and 8GB RAM variants of OnePlus 6T, I must tell you that you will not experience any major difference in regular tasks. The 2GB RAM (over 8GB RAM variant) difference kicks in when you try to do everything extremely power intensive at once. For instance, the phone just doesn't slow down a bit even while playing graphically intensive games, shooting 4K videos at 60fps, editing photos and running more than 20 tabs in Google Chrome at the same time. There's simply no compromise in the hardware and software department. You get the best-in-class Snapdragon 845 CPU, 10GB RAM of course and the company's brilliantly optimized OxygenOS with the latest Android OS. It's a combination that will happily serve you for the next two years. In addition to a new paint job and extra 2GB RAM, OnePlus has also improved the charging speed for this special edition handset. OnePlus calls it Warp 30 and it is company's fastest charging tech ever that offers 50 percent extra power compared to OnePlus' Dash charging technology. There's technically no change in the camera hardware for the special edition OnePlus 6T. The smartphone flaunts the same 20MP+16MP dual-lens camera setup at the rear and a 16MP front-facing shooter. The camera hardware is pretty capable to capture crisp and detailed shots in favorable and low-light conditions. Portrait image output is good outdoors but the bokeh effect and image quality takes a hit when you are shooting inside. I would have loved to see some additional benefits to buyers who would invest in the OnePlus 6T McLaren edition. For instance, the company could have bundled the handset with a pair of headphones/earphones with McLaren branding or have simply added official IP rating for protection against water-dust. While these two things would have added some certain value to the overall package, the price would have increased even further. OnePlus 6T McLaren edition is indeed a powerhouse of multitasking. It is a phone that just doesn't demand any caring and attention to manage RAM and memory. If you are a die-hard McLaren fan and just don't want to compromise on speed and performance (processing, multitasking, and gaming), don't think twice before buying this special edition OnePlus 6T. But if you are looking for the best value for money flagship phone, you must evaluate some important things.",By Rohit Arora,"Updated: Wednesday, January 2, 2019, 17:02 [IST]"
19,Nokia 7.1 review: Impressive design fused with smooth performance,https://www.gizbot.com//mobile/reviews/nokia-7-1-review-impressive-design-fused-with-smooth-performance-056484.html,PROS  Brilliant designImpressive displayHDR 10 support,CONS  Underwhelming gaming designMediocre battery life," Â  Let's kick off with the design of the phone. The Nokia 7.1 has a glass sandwich and metal frame construction that gives it a premium look and feel. While the device isn't heavy, it still has enough mass to make it feel like a quality product. One of the best parts of this device is the software. Nokia going ahead with AndroidOne over Android seems to be working in its favor. The unit we reviewed had Android 9 out-of-the-box installed on it. There's no bloatware, and UI is really smooth and features like the 'Ambient Display' that shows missed calls, messages and app notifications without having to wake up the device, makes life easier. Optics wise, the Nokia 7.1 packs a dual camera setup powered by Zeiss optics and electronic images stabilization. The setup comprises of a 12MP sensor with an aperture of f/1.8 and a 5MP sensor with f/2.4 aperture. For selfie enthusiasts, the company has placed an 8MP sensor up front. Under the hood, the Nokia 7.1 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor paired with 4GB of RAM. While it sounds like a pretty outdated for this price segment, the performance of the device is actually pretty zippy and smooth. The day-to-day tasks work like a charm and we didn't notice any lag or stutter while switching between the apps or navigating through the main menu. However, you wouldn't want to play high-end games on the Nokia 7.1 as it struggles to keep up with the pace the games require. Even mild gaming on the device made it a bit toasty, which is nothing new on devices that fall under this budget. If HMD rolls out some performance enhancing updates, we might be able to play a game or two of PUBG without roasting our palms. Overall, the Nokia 7.1 is an impressive device with a gorgeous design and a beautiful display. It offers a premium look that you won't find on a lot of devices in this price range.",By Vishal Kawadkar,"Updated: Saturday, December 29, 2018, 17:46 [IST]"
