      " LG recently unveiled the company's top-of-the-line flagship smartphone- V40 ThinQ in the Indian market. It is a smartphone that first appeared in October 2018, but is still LG's best mobile device. The V40 ThinQ has been launched at a premium price tag of Rs. 49,990 in India. It fights 2018's flagship devices from Google, Samsung, OnePlus and some value flagship smartphones launched in the year 2019 from Honor, Vivo, and OPPO. These handsets are much popular than LG's premium smartphones, which are usually not taken seriously by consumers in India.    LG V40 ThinQ has the same story. It might not sell in big numbers in India due to bad timing. The V40 ThinQ is essentially like that creative kid in class who can give toppers (Pixels, iPhones and Galaxy phones in this case) a run for their money, provided that the world knows about the kid. It is the first mainstream smartphone to boast 5 cameras; three at the rear and two at the front. You will also find a crisp and super vibrant 2K display, premium audio delivery and durable water-dust resistant body. LG V40 ThinQ is my present daily driver and is super fun to use, mainly because I keep photography in my highest regards. How different is LG V40 ThinQ from Google Pixel phones, OnePlus 6T, Galaxy S series smartphones and Chinese flagship phones from Honor and OnePlus? Let's find out in the following review.  LG V40's 5-lens camera setup is simply one-of-its-kind on a smartphone. The camera assembly comprises of 12MP 2x Zoom Telephoto lens with OIS and PDAF (F/2.4), 16MP Ultrawide-angle lens with no autofocus (F/1.9) , and 12MP Standard lens with dual PDAF and OIS (F/1.5 aperture). The front gets dual-lens setup featuring an 8MP standard lens and a 5MP wide-angle lens. The telephoto lens at the rear offers a 45 deg. Field of view (FOV) and takes you closer to the subjects. It is the lens that you should use while taking close up shots. The standard lens, which you will use most of the time, offers a decent 78 deg. FOV. Then comes the LG's signature Ultrawide-angle lens, which has improved a lot in the last few years and offers 107 deg. FOV on LG V40 ThinQ. I am simply a fan of LG's ultra-wide angle lens. It is undoubtedly the best on a smartphone, better than Samsung's and Huawei's ultra-wide angle lens' implementation and gives your photography a new perspective. The distorting effect is almost negligible in images shot with an ultra-wide angle lens. The 5-lens camera assembly makes LG V40 ThinQ a brilliant phone for photographers who love to explore the world around them. The much improved wide-angle lens makes for a very good add-on for landscape shots to capture scenic views. The wide-angle perspective also makes everyday shots of streets, buildings, etc. quite appealing. If you also like to explore the rush of busy Indian cities, the triple-lens camera system will come really handy. LG has also added a variety of Cinematography effects in â€˜Cine Vide' mode that makes video shooting quite interesting. You also get a Manual mode for Video which is simply a great add-on on a smartphone. The camera on V40 is not the best bet for portrait photography. Results are not always impressive. However, the camera allows you to control the amount of bokeh even after taking a shot which makes it possible to fine-tune the image output. In comparison, Pixel 2 XL which is now selling at a very good price captures brilliant portraits and is also a better handset for low-light photography. If you want to capture one single frame in all three perspectives, simply use the Triple shot mode. When enabled, V40 takes a shot with each of the three cameras and presents you the same image captured in ultra wide, normal, and with the telephoto lens. Besides, the AI composition gives you a better representation of colors and also suggests the right lens to use while framing a shot. LG's AI implementation is a bit smarter than other manufacturers approach of using machine learning to improve the photography experience. The whole package makes LG V40 ThinQ the best camera smartphone for content creators, cinematographers, and videographers. Coming onto image quality, the pictures show excellent contrast, punchy colors and good details in daylight. The V40's camera also captures a great amount of dynamic range on clear days. The blue color of the sky and greens of trees are beautifully captured. The sharpness in images is not at par with Google Pixel devices though. Besides, you will notice a shift in color balance in images shot with the three lenses. And as usual, LG's camera software still creates a posterized effect in order to keep the noise in check when images are shot in unfavorable lighting. If you can make peace with some level of noise, the three lenses perform a good job when the sun sets. However, I must mention that LG V40 ThinQ is still not my first preference for low-light photography. Google Pixel 3 and even Pixel 2/2XL phones are still the most recommended phones for low-light photography and even for portrait shots which is another area where LG V40 ThinQ struggles. LG V40 ThinQ boasts a big 6.4-inches QHD+ OLED panel that offers a resolution of 1,440 x 3,120 pixels. This translates to a pixel density of 538 ppi making videos, pictures, and text super crisp. The new OLED panel by LG is vibrant, produces more accurate colors and is also fairly bright at the same time making it easy to use the handset outdoors. The screen on LG V40 ThinQ is better than Honor View 20's LCD panel and even better than OnePlus 6T's AMOLED display in terms of contrast and sharpness. However, there's one drawback. The display on LG V40 ThinQ has a big notch and slightly thicker bezels on all four sides than the competition. It did not bother me much in everyday use even after considering the fact that I have recently tested the above two mentioned handsets. It is worth mentioning that the contrast levels on LG V40's OLED panel are not at par with Samsung's AMOLED displays. If you keep LG V40 ThinQ side-by-side with a recent Samsung Galaxy phone, you will notice that the blacks on LG's OLED are not as deep as blacks on the Super AMOLED panel on Galaxy phones (S9/S9+). Even after such noticeable issues, the display on LG V40 ThinQ is still one-of-the best I have used in last one year. It ensures an immersive gameplay and video playback experience while playing games like Asphalt 9, PUBG and streaming media content on Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, etc. Set the graphics to highest and see the minutest details unfolding on the vibrant OLED panel. The phone's excellent audio delivery (with and without headphones) also enhances the multimedia experience multifold. LG V40 ThinQ looks and feels super premium in hands. It is also one-of-the most durable smartphone out there in the market. The phone is IP68 certified for dust and water resistance. The front and back are protected by Gorilla Glass 5 and the phone also gets MIL-STD-810G military certification for shock resistance. The rear panel has a smooth glossy finish but it picks up far fewer smudges than the other flagships that sport glass backs. As far as usability is concerned, the phone is very light and can be used with one hand for screen navigation, dialer, scrolling FB, Instagram feed and while browsing web pages. I would recommend using both hands while using the camera and controlling volume by physical buttons as V40 ThinQ is extremely slippery and essentially a big phone for users with small hands. LG has put a lot of hard work to make V40 the best sounding smartphone in its respective price-point. Resultant, the sound delivery produced by V40 (with and without headphones) is extremely immersive. The audio is loud and accurate. The smartphone comes equipped with DTS:X Surround sound with Boom-Box speaker. The speaker uses the empty space in V40 ThinQ's body as a sound chamber to produce richer audio experience. While playing games and streaming audio/video files, you can actually feel the phone's body resonating with the audio. The audio output is tuned by the British company- Meridian Audio and creates an immersive sound experience. The phone also has quad Hi-Fi DACs to drive high-impedance headphones. The audio through the bundled LG earphones is crystal clear as the phone also supports DTS:X Virtual Surround for headphones. This adds more spatial elements to audio you play on V40 ThinQ. The best part, LG V40 ThinQ also has the good old 3.5mm headphone jack so you can use any regular earphones with the phone. While using the earphones, you can also enable Quad-DAC to experience louder and richer audio. You can also choose between various audio profiles and can also create custom ones for the type of audio you like to hear. Overall, LG V40 ThinQ is a great sounding phone that will surely please audiophiles. It comes as s surprise that the flagship V40 ThinQ is still running the old Android 8.1.0 in the year 2019. The smartphone is due to receive the Android Pie update sooner or later. LG needs to rework on its software update cycles as the brand is clearly ignoring this critical part of its mobility division. As far as software performance is concerned, the phone is really snappy, exactly how a flagship should be in today's time, and hardly lags while loading apps, videos and games. A number of useful software features have been tucked inside the settings menu to enhance the user-experience. I have seen over the time that LG's custom UI is not widely preferred by the audience. I find it quite efficient and to the point. You get Always-on display, extensive color calibration options to customize the Quad HD display, HDR video effect to make media content appear vibrant, System-wide search, Comfort mode to reduce strain on eyes, Floating bar to add readily used shortcuts, Smart doctor that works as a phone optimizer and a lot more. You can choose between a standard app drawer UI and iOS-like home-screens UI. The phone's software also allows you to reduce the screen's resolution to save battery life and customize the notch screen with different cutouts styles and color skins. Besides, the typing experience on LG V40 ThinQ is simply brilliant, probably the best I have experienced on an Android smartphone. The haptic engine deployed is really powerful and creates iOS-like (Taptic engine) feedback. You are bound to experience life-like typing and touch feedback on the OLED panel of V40 ThinQ. Overall, LG's custom UI is quite feature-rich and colorful but the slow update cycle is really something LG needs to address for consumers.Â  LG V40 ThinQ is backed by Snapdragon 845 chipset. The phone has 6 GB LPDDR4x RAM and 128 GB internal storage. The V40 ThinQ also has microSD card support to expand the internal memory to up to 512GB. This is no doubt flagship hardware but now when other manufacturers are ready to introduce smartphones with the newest Snapdragon 855 SoC, LG V40 ThinQ might not hold up well in the race of flagships. While there are no performance issues with LG V40 ThinQ, you might not want to spend a sum of 50K on a smartphone with last year's flagship chipset and dated Android Oreo. LG needs to fasten up launch cycles in the Indian market if they really want to sell mobile devices in huge numbers. The V40 ThinQ could have done a lot better if it had been launched in the same or next month in India after the global launch. Nevertheless, if you find a good deal, a price-cut may be, V40 ThinQ is a brilliant phone to have. The phone does now slow down while playing the most graphical intensive games at extreme settings. You can run more than 20 apps at a time without worrying about any performance slowdowns. I only noticed some degree of temperature increase while playing games for a good 20 min on a stretch and while shooting long duration videos in 4K resolution and in â€˜Cine mode'. The phone cools down in no time when you start using it moderately. The V40 ThinQ offers solid on-call quality. There's wireless charging support and the phone has Bluetooth 5.0 with aptX HD Support for immersive wireless audio delivery. LG V40 ThinQ is backed by probably the least powerful battery cell on a flagship smartphone. The phone is backed by a 3,300 battery unit which cannot last for a day if you a heavy user. If you stream videos on loop, play graphically intensive games and use the camera on a stretch, you will find the V40 ThinQ struggling to last even for a day with one full charge. The V40 ThinQ is another impressive flagship phone from LG. The brilliant 5-lens camera setup alone gives me enough reasons to recommend this phone to anyone who keeps photography in his/her highest regards. Besides, the vibrant QHD+ OLED screen, super durable design and best-in-class audio setup are some more reasons to invest in this device. However, you just cannot ignore the competition. Despite the fact that LG has put an amazing camera setup, brilliant display, and best-in-class audio experience, the V40 ThinQ has to overcome a fair share of challenges. It rivals OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition, which packs in whopping 10GB RAM, latest Android OS and super fast Warp Charge technology. However, OnePlus 6T does not hold well in camera, audio, and display department. Then comes the OPPO R17 Pro which you can simply ignore without giving much thought. Honor View 20 is another device which you must check out. It is priced lower much than the LG V40 ThinQ and offers an interesting proposition. And if you do not want to spend a huge sum on last year's technology, the market is almost ready to offer the latest breed of flagship smartphones from Samsung, especially the new Galaxy S10 E, S10, and S10+.Â \n",

      " Vivo today announced a new smartphone in the Indian market. Priced at Rs. 28,990, Vivo V15 Pro packs in some really cool features that were only introduced last year in company's top-of-the-line Vivo Nex (First Gen.) smartphone. Vivo V15 Pro is quite an interesting proposition. The handset sports a triple-lens rear camera setup, 32MP pop up selfie camera and an edge-to-edge AMOLED screen featuring an in-display fingerprint scanner.  And while these are some really attractive features that will please consumers who appreciate new technologies, there are some comprises as well. Vivo V15 Pro is backed by the newly introduced Snapdragon 675 CPU which on papers is not essentially a flagship chipset. The smartphone also does not feature a Type-C port, which rather comes as a surprise in today's time from a handset which is full of multiple mobile innovations. Having said that, I have started using Vivo V15 Pro as my daily driver and here's what I have to say about this handset in my first impressions. Let's start with the X factor of this smartphone, which has to be the 32MP Pop up selfie-camera.  If you are always clicking selfies and creating stories on Snapchat and Instagram, you will love this phone. The 32MP selfie camera placed on the retractable camera module captures excellent shots. The motorized camera module pops out instantly with a sci-fi sound that itself is enough to turn the heads. As the company has used a big camera sensor, the images show very good detailing and fine textures. You will also find a variety of modes and filters which further improves the camera experience. The AI Beautify mode is pretty feature-rich and allows you to change skin tone and reshape almost every element of your face including jawline, eye span, and forehead, the shape of the nose and even shape of lips. I am sure there is a good consumer base who would love to play around with such features while clicking selfies. What's good? Vivo has used a three-lens camera setup which comprises of one 8MP wide-angle lens, 5MP standard lens and the 48MP quad pixel sensor working on a decently sized f/1.8 aperture. The results are pleasing. Images show true to eyes colors and the AI is not very harsh. Unlike Honor's AI mode which is pretty intensive and not always at the point, Vivo is doing a good job in the camera software. The camera takes good portrait shots when light conditions are favorable. The app also offers a dedicated Night mode which can take some well-lit shots if you keep the phone steady. You also get 4K video recording, HDR, Pro mode, and AI beauty even for rear camera mode. Overall, Vivo has offered a feature-rich camera app to please shutterbugs. Vivo V15 Pro sports a big and vibrant AMOLED display with no notch to hamper the viewing experience. The 6.39-inch screen with 19.5:9 aspect ratio offers a screen-to-body ratio of 91.6%. The display is quite vibrant and is surrounded by thin bezels which make gameplay and video playback quite immersive. If you watch a lot of videos and play long game sessions, you will really like this AMOLED panel. Vivo V15 Pro is quite a head-turner. The phone looks and feels premium and can be used with one hand as the buttons are placed at convenient spots. The rear panel of the phone looks rather interesting and sports a gradient pattern. Vivo calls it Spectrum Ripple design and it makes Vivo V15 Pro stand out from the crowd. Vivo V15 Pro is one of the very few smartphones in the year 2019 to offer tow very useful features. The smartphone comes with a dedicated microSD card slot so that you don't need to compromise on storage and connectivity. Moreover, if you still prefer using your old but good wired headphones, you are most welcome as the V15 Pro does not ditch the good old 3.5mm headphone jack. Vivo V15 Pro runs on FunTouch OS which offers a number of useful software features. These features are tucked inside the settings section. These include Game cube which when enabled restricts notifications for a seamless gaming experience. You get DND mode, Motorbike mode which promotes safer riding experience by controlling incoming calls and texts. Besides, you also get Face beauty mode for video call, enable a number of smart motion features, clone applications mirror your phone to other media devices and can even record everything on the screen with Screen capture feature. What's not good? Vivo V15 Pro is the most technologically advanced smartphone in sub Rs. 30k price-segment; however, the smartphone still lacks the Type-C port. The choice of microUSB 2.0 port seems rather disappointing in the year 2019. As far as fast-charging is concerned, the handset supports Dual-Engine fast charging which is quite effective. The bundled charger can refuel the battery from zero to 25 % in about 15 minutes. While Vivo FunTouch OS is really feature-rich, it is still not the best Android custom skin in the market. If you have been a long-time Stock Android user, this iOS lookalike Android skin will not please you much. However, the choice of Android skin is a matter of personal preference and if you have used a Vivo's smartphone in past, you will not face any issues in the software department on Vivo V15 Pro. Even though Vivo has improved the in-screen fingerprint scanning technology to a good extent, it is still not the most comfortable way to unlock the handset. I found myself struggling with the in-screen fingerprint scanner quite often as the response time and the unlock accuracy is still not at par with the good old physical fingerprint scanners. Vivo V15 Pro seems like the perfect phone for consumers who appreciate new mobile technologies. The phone offers an interesting triple-lens camera setup and a capable 32MP pop up selfie camera that captures excellent selfies. The selfie camera is indeed the X factor of the smartphone. Besides, I really liked the multimedia viewing-experience on this handset as the edge-to-edge AMOLED panel really makes video playback and gameplay immersive. The microUSB 2.0 port seems like an odd choice for a smartphone that packs in so many innovative features; however, the Vivo's dual-engine fast-charging speed is quite effective. We are still testing the processing and computing performance of Snapdragon 675 CPU which is a fairly new chipset from Qualcomm. Stay tuned for our comprehensive review of Vivo V15 Pro on Gizbot.com.\n",

      "|Updated: Thursday, February 14, 2019, 17:49 [IST]\n",
      " The definition of innovation in the smartphone industry has changed over time. It no longer means bringing completely new and disruptive tech to the table. Instead, it has become more about bringing new functionality based on the existing techs. Well, the latest example would be Vivo's NEX 2 that offers two screens on either panel making it one of the most unique smartphones launched in recent times.  Vivo, who is also the pioneer of motorized popups, took a different approach with the NEX 2. Although Vivo isn't the first to incorporate a dual display on a phone, it might be the one who managed it to make it more useful and practical. Instead of making the secondary display only a camera viewfinder, the company made sure it could double as the main screen too. The main screen takes up 6.39-inches of the real estate, while the secondary screen is a 5.49-inch size. Both panels are Super AMOLED and make for a quality viewing experience. Other specifications include a Snapdragon 845 chipset, octa-core processor paired with Adreno 630 GPU. The chipset is backed by 10GB of RAMand 128GB of internal storage. It runs Android 9.0 Pie with FunTouch OS 4.5 atop. It has an in-display fingerprint sensor and facial recognition for added security. And, to keep the phone running, Vivo has placed a 3500mAh battery. But is the device worth placing your bets on? Let's break it down for you.  Futuristic design The Vivo NEX 2 is something that will instantly catch your attention, thanks to its unique design and form factor. The company has crammed in two display but that hardly affects the thickness of the phone. It still feels slim and comfortable to hold. You might face some difficulties using it with one hand if you have small palms, but that's why you have a second screen in place. The bezels around the bigger screen are miniscule which complements the overall aesthetics of the device. It has the volume rockers, and two buttons to switch screens on the sides, while the bottom has a SIM card tray, USB-C port, microphone, and speaker grille. Since this is a glass contraption, there's always a fear of dropping the phone and breaking the screen. But, if you accidentally damage one screen, another screen will come for your rescue. Solid performer The NEX 2 is a powerful performer, as one would expect from a flagship. The device works very smoothly in everyday use and handles high-end gaming without breaking a sweat. Under the hood, the smartphone is powered by a Snapdragon 845 octa-core chipset, making it one the most powerful phones around. We fired up some graphics-hungry games and pushed the device to its limits, and boy can it take a beating? Definitely! All the games ran well including PUBG without any sign of lag and stutter. We ran the device through some benchmarks and found out that it performs better than the OnePlus 6T and the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 in some areas. The NEX 2 secured 4,722 in 3DMark which is more than the Galaxy Note 9 that scored 4290. The device scored 296,840 in AnTuTu, compared to the OnePlus 6T's 262,273. The smartphone is backed by a 3500mAh battery. At first it might sound like a small number considering there are two displays, but fortunately, that doesn't seem to affect the battery life. Well, that's because you're unlikely to use both screens simultaneously often. We managed to use the device for a whole day and still managed to save some juice for the second day. Our usage included gaming, video streaming, internet browsing, social media, and voice calling. For moderate users, the battery will last for at least one and a half day before requiring a fast charge. Decent cameras The NEX 2 packs a triple camera setup comprising a 12MP sensor with an f/1.8 aperture lens, 4-axis OIS, and dual pixel PDAF. While the secondary camera is a 2MP depth sensor with an f/1.8 aperture for providing the popular bokeh effect. The third camera is a time-of-flight or TOF sensor with an IR illuminator which comes in handy for both 3D face recognition and selfie beautification. We wouldn't call this the best camera on a smartphone, but it still captures good pictures. In well-lit surroundings, the camera produced some sharp and bright images. We did notice some noise in pictures taken in low-light but are still usable. Boring UI The Vivo NEX 2 runs Android 9.0 wrapped under the Futouch OS 4.5 skin, and honestly, it isn't one of the phone's strongest traits. The UI doesn't offer an app drawer, and there's no way you could add it from the settings. This forces the users to make new folders to store the apps. Although the device has the latest Android on the software front, the tweaks don't work in its favor. The company could have given both options making it more convenient for the users. The software, however, supports some of the best gestures you'll find on Android. Swiping up from the bottom will show the control center while swiping three fingers to either side will switch the screens. While the UI has a striking resemblance with iOS, the smart implementations make up for the shortcomings. No wide-angle, zoom lens As mentioned above, the NEX 2 comes equipped with a triple camera setup comprising a 12MP + 2MP and the third camera with an IR illuminator for 3D face recognition. Although the camera performance is above average, if not great, it does lack some features that one would expect from a smartphone of this stature. We expected the camera to at least feature a wide-angle lens or a zoom lens. Smartphones like the Samsung Galaxy M20 are also offering a wide-angle lens that allows you to capture ultra-wide shots at 120-degree angles compared to the normal 78-degree angles seen on other smartphones. Vivo could have added one of these features to make the cameras even better. Limited availability As of now, the Vivo NEX 2 is only available for the Chinese market at a price of 4,998 yuan (&dollar;727). And, that's a problem if you want to get your hands on one. There's a possibility that the device might not make it to the Indian market anytime soon. This could be one of those devices which are restricted to specific markets to see the user response. If the device makes it to the Indian market, be ready to see a hefty price tag as it offers top-end specifications and a unique design. Let's keep our finger crossed and hope to see an India variant soon. The dual screens are without a doubt the biggest selling point of the Vivo NEX 2. As it's something the user will interact with the most. And it gets better if you get two screens to play around with. The front screen is big, bright, vibrant and most importantly, it's full. This might remind you of the Vivo NEX S and it just as impressive. Unlike the dual screen phones we've seen in the past, Vivo has placed an AMOLED display on both sides. The main screen takes up 6.39-inches of the real estate, while the secondary screen is a 5.49-inch size. Since there aren't any notches, the display looks spotless and makes it a great tool for multimedia consumption. The second screen, on the other hand, features a big chin and forehead. It houses all the cameras, the branding, and an earpiece. It's a 5.49-inch Super AMOLED screen that comes into the act when you feel like clicking a selfie. But, you can also use it as the primary display if high brightness or sharpness isn't what you seek. Switching between the screens is easy, you just need to press the buttons placed on the sides of the phone. Another feature that the back screen is what Vivo likes to call it - the Lunar Ring. It is an LED arc that surrounds the camera setup and lights up to provide an effect for your selfies. Well, all these are just a few used cases of the second screen, but in my opinion, the biggest benefit of having the second display is that users can continue to use the device even after they accidentally break either of the screens. The Vivo NEX 2 certainly feels like a peek into the future and seems like a thoughtful and creative way to do away with the controversial notch. And with features like mirror mode and dual screen gaming, the second display sounds much more useful than being just a gimmick to look different from other smartphones in the much-crowded market. While this design doesn't look like it would be adopted by other OEMs, but it's great to see the comapnies like Vivo poised at offering new designs to the users and keep the mobile devices fun. At &dollar;730, which translates to something around Rs 52,000 in Indian currency, this unique smartphone relatively affordable. It will be interesting to see how the Indian market would respond to the new design and approach. Vivo has received tremendous response in the Indian market with its other offerings and this could be a surprise too. If the company refines the software even further, this could be a well-rounded flagship device.\n",

      " OPPO recently announced a new mid-range smartphone series in the Indian market. The first smartphone under the new K series is OPPO K1, which goes on sale today on Flipkart.com. OPPO K1 is the most affordable smartphone with an in-screen fingerprint scanner. Priced at Rs. 16,990, OPPO K1 also offers a 25MP selfie camera, a dedicated microSD card slot and features a dual-lens rear camera setup. It fights the highly popular Xiaomi Redmi Note series handsets, even Xiaomi Mi A1, Honor 10 Lite and Nokia's sub 20K smartphones. Let's find out what's good and what's not good about this new smartphone from the Chinese smartphone manufacturer.  Let's start with the highlight feature of OPPO K1, which is also the X factor of this handset. OPPO K1 is the most affordable smartphone with an in-screen fingerprint scanner. This can be a feature to flaunt and might give you some attention but the fingerprint scanner is not of the best quality we have seen so far. It was quite easy to setup the in-screen fingerprint scanner but it failed to unlock the handset quite often during our short testing with the device. There's also a noticeable delay in unlocking the handset. The company has also offered Face unlock but it might not be very secure as it is essentially driven by the software and does not have dedicated hardware to support it. OPPO K1 flaunts a 25MP selfie camera, which was able to capture good images during our testing. The camera works on F/2.0 aperture and can also create a software-driven bokeh effect. Images looked crisp and showed good detailing. You also get a variety of filters and modes to improve the selfie output. The camera also uses AI to help you make the most out of massive 25MP selfie shooter. Some images can look animated as AI gets pretty harsh sometimes. Thankfully, you can control the beautification level via on-screen controls. The front camera can record videos in 1080p resolution. While the highlights of OPPO K1 are the in-screen fingerprint scanner and 25mp selfie camera, I found the 6.4-inch Full HD+ AMOLED screen to be the best feature of this handset. OPPO K1 flaunts a Waterdrop notch and offers a very good screen-to-body ratio. The display is slightly reflective but it still makes for a very good panel in this price-point. As it is an AMOLED panel, the videos and games will offer an immersive viewing experience. The screen is also protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 5, which is an added bonus. As far as the rear camera is considered, OPPO K1 sports a 16MP + 2 MP dual-lens rear camera setup with AI beautification. The camera can record 4K videos but sadly EIS is not supported. The camera seemed snappy and image output also looked good. The camera supports HDR and the app also offers a number of filters to let you experiment with the shots you capture. The rear camera lets you control the AI Beautification level as per your preference. Besides, you get Portrait mode, Time-lapse, Stockers, Manual mode but sadly there's no built-in Slow-motion mode in OPPO K1. Like most of the smartphones these days, OPPO K1 also comes in a 3D Gradient design. You can choose between two colors- Vivianite Blue and Graphite Black. The smartphone looks appealing and the gradient colors make it quite eye-catchy, but the handset fails to give a premium in-hand feel. The quality of material used to design OPPO K1 feels cheap and the glossy back panel makes OPPO k1 quite slippery. Moreover, due to the big 6.4-inch screen, OPPO K1 is not a perfect fit for one-hand operation. The closest rivals- Redmi Note 6 Pro, Xiaomi Mi A2 and Nokia 7.1 Plus feel far premium than OPPO K1. OPPO K1 is backed by a capable but an underclocked Snapdragon 660 CPU which is combined with 4GB RAM + 64GB internal memory. The handset felt snappy and responsive; however, we are yet to test the handset for its gaming, processing and multitasking performance. The smartphone is powered by a decently sized 3,600 mAh battery unit which in numbers is not as par with the rival devices like Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 and Redmi Note 6 Pro. But the choice of AMOLED screen might work in OPPO K1's favor. There's no Type C port and the handset also does not support fast-charging, which is a big letdown. What's good here is the dedicated microSD card support. You can use two nano SIM cards and a microSD card at the same time. Another disappointment is the dated Android 8.1 Oreo which is accompanied by OPPO's ColorOS 5.2 Operating System. The ColorOS is not our favorite skin as it comes across as highly animated and full of many unwanted apps and software tweaks which might prove as a deal-breaker if you prefer a clean stock Android UI. OPPO K1 has some really good features to offer at Rs. 17k price-point, but the smartphone is not free of disappointments. It boasts a vibrant AMOLED panel which houses an in-screen fingerprint scanner. There's dedicated microSD card support and a capable 25MP selfie shooter. Sadly, there's no Type C port, no fast-charging, dated Android Oreo and the chipset used is an underclocked version of Snapdragon 660. It's too early to give a verdict on the real-life performance of OPPO K1. We will stress test the device to find out its multitasking, battery, gaming and camera performance.

      " Samsung's stint with the budget smartphones hasn't been something it could brag about. With brands like Xiaomi, Realme, Honor, and Asus dominating the segment, Samsung was due to launch a powerful smartphone that could go up against the likes of these devices. And, the company has done just that with its new M series of smartphones.    The company unveiled its M20 exclusively for the Indian market priced at Rs 10,990 (3GB/32GB) and 12,990 (4GB/64GB). And, we got the 4GB variant in our office for review. The device comes with a big screen, an Exynos 7885 octa-core chipset, and a dual rear camera setup with a wide angle lens. But is it the best smartphone in the segment? Let's find out in our review.  Â  Â  Well, looks aren't the biggest highlight of the Galaxy M20. Samsung has used a hard plastic rear which makes the phone resistant to accidental drops. While the front panel looks beautiful, the rear is the exact opposite. The back panel has a boring design and acts as a fingerprint magnet, thanks to its glossy nature. It also houses a fingerprint sensor which has an awkward placement and we often found ourselves reaching out for the fingerprint sensor. It feels a bit uncomfortable and not suitable for someone with small palms. But, holding the device feels good, offering a good grip and a sense of durability. The Galaxy M20 is by no means qualifies as a slim smartphone. The massive 5000mAh battery makes it chunky and a bit heavy compared to other smartphones in the segment. If you are someone who drops their phones quite often, the Galaxy M20 has you covered. The front panel houses a huge display that covers the most of real estate up front. The display also has a very small notch that doesn't draw much attention. On the sides, you get the volume rockers, power key, and the SIM card tray. At the bottom, the device has a USB-C port along with the speakers and a microphone. Overall, it is a pretty well-rounded smartphone in terms of design, however, the company could have made the back panel more exciting. Samsung has used its Infinity U display for the new Galaxy M20. Although the display doesn't feature a Super AMOLED but do not get fooled by the TFT panel, as it makes for a great viewing experience. You might not get to see the dark blacks on the new panel, but that's forgivable considering the price of the device. The bezels are also pretty slim which makes this display ideal for multimedia consumption. Since the display is Widevine L1 compliant, you'll be able to stream all the content from video streaming services like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video in high definition. We played a few videos and movies on this display and were surprised by the results. The screen is fairly bright and the color reproduction is also brilliant. Although the viewing angles aren't that great, that's something TFT screens are infamous for. But, overall the display on the Samsung Galaxy M20 managed to impress us. Optics-wise, the Galaxy M20 comes equipped with a dual rear camera setup that packs a 13MP sensor with F1.9 aperture and a 5MP ultra-wide lens. The dual camera setup is complemented by an LED flash. While the 13MP is the primary sensor, the 5MP sensor lets you take ultra-wide shots at 120-angles, compared to the normal 78-angles offered by other devices in this price segment. Honestly, the camera on the Galaxy m20 is kind of a letdown. The pictures taken in good lighting conditions came out decent but still lacked details. The also showed some noise and lacked the dynamic range and sharpness. The wide angle shots also looked a bit grainy. For low light photography, the Galaxy M20 wouldn't be a good option. The images lack details and sharpness which is a bit disappointing. We also tried the 13MP front-facing camera, and we can say that it's decent for video calling and selfies. Also, the AR emoji feature is fun trying out, but it isn't that produces breathtaking selfies. Overall, the Galaxy M20 has a lot to improve on the camera-front and doesn't really gives a tough fight to its contemporaries in this particular department. Under the hood Exynos 7904 1.8Ghz octa-core chipset paired with 4GB of RAM. We were satisfied with the performance of the Galaxy M20. It managed to perform day-to-day tasks without breaking a sweat and the app launch and switching were swift. We hardly noticed any kind of lag and stutter, however, we did feel that the device gets a bit toasty when firing up some graphics-heavy games. But the mild games work like a charm on this device, thanks to the Mali-G71 GPU. The device offers Dual SIM with Dual VoLTE which ensure crystal clear voice calls. The call quality was really good and the earpiece was loud enough for crowded places as well. Also, the audio on the Galaxy M20 is powered by Dolby Atmos, but it only works with the headphones on. But, it makes for a great audio experience while watching movies as you get to hear all the sound effects with immersive details. The Galaxy M20 runs the Android 8.1 Oreo with the company's Experience UI 9.5. Well, since this is 2019, bringing a smartphone with a dated software seems unfair. While the UI feels smooth, bringing the latest Android 9 Pie would have been great. The software also comes with some bloatware, which could hamper the performance of the phone in the long run. Samsung is rumored to push Android 9 update for the device in August, but it seems a bit too late. Speaking of the battery, the smartphone is backed by a huge 5000mAh battery. The battery reservoir is surely one of the biggest highlights of the Galaxy M20. We rigorously used the phone for a whole day, and it still had a few hours of juice left. Our usage included playing a few high-end games, listening to music, browsing the internet. For moderate users, the device might work for at least a day and a half before you look for a charger. In case of a hardcore user, you will have to refuel the phone before going to bed. With the Galaxy M20, Samsung seems to have introduced a much-needed budget device for its sales. As the company plans to lock horns with the Chinese compatitors, it needs to have a powerful, feature-rich device in the segment, and the Galaxy M20 checks almost all the boxes. It comes with a brilliant display, a long-lasting battery life, and a sturdy build. Starting at Rs 10,990, it is Samsung's most aggressively priced device till date. It sure has its flaws like the design could have been more attractive, or the cameras could have been better, but it still makes for a good value for money if you look beyond these minor bumps. We wouldn't call it the best Android smartphone in this price segment, but writing it off the cards totally would be unfair. As we know, Samsung has a loyal fan-base, the new M series will definitely catch many eyes for its fresh and aggressive approach. Overall, Samsung has offered a well-rounded smartphone at an affordable price, making it a safe bet to place your money on. It seems the company has finally taken the right path with its latest M series of smartphones and should continue to launch more such smartphones. As for the Galaxy M20, we will surely recommend the device as it brings a sense of freshness to the company's budget lineup.\n",

      " Samsung has started its new innings in the budget smartphone category with the launch of its refreshed Galaxy M smartphone lineup.    The new Galaxy M series comprises of two handsets- Galaxy M10 and Galaxy M20 that come with a reasonable price tag and offer some decent set of specifications. With the release of the Galaxy M series, the South Korean tech giant is aiming to grab a good chunk of the budget smartphone market in India, which is currently ruled by Xiaomi, Honor, and Realme. Notably, Samsung's previous budget series, i.e., the Galaxy On and J series failed to impress the masses and lost the game to Xiaomi's Redmi Note series and budget handsets from Honor and the recent entrant- Realme. Having said that, Samsung is betting big on Galaxy M Series and has launched the new handsets at aggressive price-points. We got a chance to use the latest Galaxy M10 smartphone for some time and here is our feedback on the device.  Samsung Galaxy M10 is a big smartphone which is encased within a shiny polycarbonate body. The rear panel of Galaxy M10 looks pretty basic and houses only the primary camera setup stacked vertically at the top left corner. You get the Samsung branding at the center of the rear panel where the rear-mounted fingerprint scanner is usually mounted. The glossy rear panel does pick up fingerprints over a period of time and you will need to keep on cleaning the surface. Therefore, we would suggest you use a case with it. With no actual fingerprint scanner support, the device makes use of the software-driven facial recognition for the device's security. The speaker grille is also placed at the rear panel at the bottom left corner. It is not a suitable positioning to house the speaker as the audio tends to become less audible when the smartphone is placed on any flat surface. As for the positioning of the keys, the right panel of the device stores the power key and the volume rockers, whereas, the SIM card tray is placed at the left panel of the device. The placement of the lock key is ideal and it is easy to unlock the smartphone after you pick it up. One of the best things about the smartphone's design is its easy operability with a single hand. The Galaxy M10 is no doubt a big phone but even with its big size, I didn't find any difficulty in using it with one hand. The curved back panel and rounded edges give the phone a comfortable fit in hands. I was able to scroll through the device, make calls, surf the internet and even click pictures with just one hand. Overall, it's a decently designed budget smartphone by Samsung that scores well on practicality. The display up front is tall and takes up most of the space with minimal bezels around it. There is a teardrop notch at the top center that houses the front camera. Samsung is calling this panel as Infinity-V display and it is a part of the recently introduced Infinity display panels by the company. The 6.22-inch TFT display has an HD+ resolution with 720 x 1520 pixels. It comes with a Dragon Trail Asahi Glass Pro screen protector on top for protection against scratches and accidental drops. Though it might not be as effective as the Corning Gorilla Glass used for screen protection, it will still offer some level of protection for the screen. The display is colorful and is fairly bright making it easy to view content on the device under direct sunlight. The colorful display does make the pictures and videos bit appealing, albeit, it compromises a bit on clarity while playing high-resolution videos. The primary reason behind this is the HD+ display with 720 x 1520 pixel screen resolution. This means that the display can render images and videos at maximum 720 pixels. Therefore, if you are streaming any videos on YouTube or other platforms the maximum pixels which the display can render is 720 pixels and not 1080 pixels. Though, it is good to see that even being a budget device it comes with Widevine L1 certification support to play HD content from Netflix. Â  Let's have a look at the camera specifications at first. The Galaxy M10 sports a dual-lens primary camera setup that has a 13MP primary sensor with an f/1.9 aperture combined with a secondary 5MP Ultra-wide sensor with f/2.2 aperture. There is a 5MP camera at the front that captures selfies and is used for video calls. Speaking of the camera, this is the department where the smartphone lacks slightly punch. The camera of the Galaxy M10 is a bit underpowered and it captures images and videos of average quality. The smartphone is able to click decent pictures in good lighting situations; however, the low light shots are not very impressive.  The pictures lack in detailing and show noise when clicked in a dark environment. As for the wide angle lens, the quality captured is sub-par but it is still a good addition in this price-point. You can capture some good street and landscape shots with a wide-angle lens in good lighting condition. The front camera of the device also offers a middling performance and captures an average image quality. Â  Â  The Galaxy M10 smartphone comes with an Exynos 7870 chipset under the hood which is a mid-range chipset by the company. The processor is based on 14nm architecture and it clocks at 1.6GHz. You can select the smartphone from two different variants including a 2GB/16GB variant and a 3GB/32GB variant. The storage is expandable up to 512GB via a dedicated microSD card. With Galaxy M10, you don't need to compromise on storage and connectivity. In terms of performance, this might not be the fastest available budget segment smartphone in the market but it is pretty good at handling everyday tasks with ease. I didn't experience any lag or issues while using the device to carry out basic tasks such as surfing the internet, streaming online videos and some light gameplay sessions. Opening apps is also not a hustle and they launch swiftly upon selecting. Playing some high-graphics games such as Asphalt 9 and PUBG is not really fun as the device lags with heavy gameplay. Well, that can be overlooked for once considering the price point it is selling for. Â  Samsung has used an older Android 8.1 Oreo version to deploy its latest Experience 9.5 UI. While the underlying software is a bit dated, Samsung's UI makes for smooth user experience. The UI is clean and neat with no unwanted clutter at sight. To pull up the app drawer, you just need to swipe up or down on any home screen. Apps open up quickly and the phone doesn't lag while navigating from screen to other. The settings menu is neatly laid out and offers some useful features like One-handed mode, gestures, Smart alert, Dual-Messenger and a lot more. Samsung has really improved the software experience and the new Galaxy M series is not less than any premium smartphone in the software department. Notably, the Galaxy M series including both the Galaxy M10 and Galaxy M20 are expected to release the Android Pie update sometime this year. Â  The Galaxy M10 is fueled by a small 3,400mAh Li-Ion battery unit which is non-removable. There is no fast charging support with the device and it takes well over 2 hours for the device to charge from zero to 100 percent. As for the backup, the device retains its juice for more than half a day with a single charge. If you are performing basic tasks such as calling, internet surfing, and casual video and audio playback, you might not need to plug in the device twice. However, if you use the device extensively for heavy gaming and continuous high-res. Video/audio playback, you will need to plug the device again or simply keep a power bank handy. The new Galaxy M series by Samsung is a big step up from the company's previous budget smartphones. It is a perfect budget smartphone for consumers who were eagerly waiting for a feature-packed performance driven budget smartphone from a trusted brand like Samsung. This handset will definitely create some big troubles for Xiaomi, Honor, Asus, and Realme in the Indian market. Galaxy M10 offers an immersive display with a tiny waterdrop notch at the top. The wide-angle lens is a good addition but the overall camera performance of the smartphone is pretty average. The smartphone really shines in software and storage department. You get a clean UI and a dedicated microSD card slot which makes Galaxy M10 a pretty solid budget offering. Overall, Samsung Galaxy M10 is a suitable budget device for most users looking for an affordable handset with a trusted brand name.\n",

      " The first month of the year 2019 is not yet over and Honor is back with its second product for Indian consumers. This time around, the company has unveiled the company's flagship smartphone- View 20. The much anticipated Honor View 20 is the company's most innovative and powerful smartphone till date. Backed by several industry-leading technologies, Honor View 20 fights the widely popular OnePlus 6T and even takes on Huawei's very own flagship- the Mate 20 Pro.  Priced at Rs.37,999 for the 6GB RAM variant, does this phone deserves to win the title of best value flagship smartphone in India. We tried to answer the question with our review of Honor View 20.    Honor View 20 is the first working punch-hole screen phone for masses in India and some other markers across the globe. Videos and games run edge-to-edge and look quite immersive on this handset. Honor has achieved the impossible feat by replacing the notch at center with a tiny 4.5mm punch-hole carved out at the top-left corner of the screen. The spot houses the 25MP front-facing shooter that uses a 3.05mm customized camera lens. This is technically very impressive as unlike the notch placed at center; the punch-hole doesn't get in way much and makes for a full-screen viewing experience. The company is calling it â€˜All-View' display design and it makes Honor View 20 a great multimedia mobile device to stream videos and to play games. The display on Honor View 20 also supports HDR10 and you can enjoy watching crisp content on media streaming apps. However, the application support for this new kind of display is still a work in progress. Most apps don't play in full-screen mode and leave borders or just cut off below the hole which is a bummer. You can disable the punch hole if you find it ridiculous and blocking your full-screen experience. But this is not a permanent issue and will soon be rectified with the app's future updates. You will find the same screen-design in a lot of flagship and even mid-range devices this year. The upcoming Samsung Galaxy S10 will also flaunt the similar all-screen design. As far as display's general characteristics are concerned, the screen measures 6.4-inches diagonally. It's a big LCD panel with a resolution of 1080 x 2310 pixels (~398 ppi density). The pixel density is certainly not the best-in-class but you will hardly notice any pixelation. What might bother you is the color reproduction. As compared to an AMOLED panel, the content-especially games and videos on View 20's IPS panel look slightly less immersive. Blacks are not the deepest and reds, blues are not the most vibrant in this price-segment. Typical of an LCD panel, the contrast is also not the best-in-class. But there are audiences who prefer such LCD's colors over an AMOLED panel as the LCDs offer slightly better sunlight visibility than AMOLED screens. Huawei's EMUI 9.5 let you customize the View 20's display characteristics as per your requirement. You can tweak color mode and set display's color temperature as per your preferences.Â  Overall, Honor View 20 gets all things right in innovation and craftsmanship department but a good vibrant screen is deeply missed. By now it is well established that Honor loves Blue color, gradient patterns and shiny metal-glossy finish back panels on mobile devices. You can see and experience it all in the View 20. While the front of the handset is all-screen, there's a lot going on at the back panel. Honor View 20 flaunts a laser engraved reflective pattern at the back panel which is created by nanolithography technology. The 3D curved back of View 20 has a nano-vacuum coating that creates the V-shape color gradient with a gleaming effect. This gives Honor View 20 its unique identity. The shiny V pattern is instantly noticeable and is there whether you like it or not. We found the Sapphire Blue color variant a bit too flashy for our liking and that's why we recommend you to see the phone in person in all its three colors before making a final decision. The smartphone will also be available in Midnight Black and Phantom Blue color variants, which look subtle and more pleasing to eyes. Sadly these colors are offered only in 8GB RAM variants. Honor View 20 is a big device and the fact that it is very slippery; you would need both the hands to properly use it. It is 75.4mm wide and has a big edge-to-edge screen. As a result, reaching top corners of the screen is a real pain. Even though I have big hands, I did struggle to reach top corners of the screen to access status bar, to activate flashlight in the camera app and to disable AI mode. If you have small hands, you would struggle while typing text messages, dialing numbers on the dial pad, clicking pictures and performing above mentioned tasks. I was quite excited to read about the on-paper camera specs of Honor View 20 during its launch. I couldn't wait to test if the 48MP primary camera could match up the likes of flagship Huawei mate 20 Pro. While the View 20 cannot match the photography skills of Mate 20 Pro, it can give other phones a run for their money. In fact, it is the most feature-packed and probably the best camera smartphone in sub 40k price-point. I would have named Honor View 20 the best camera smartphone in its respective price-point provided that the company has got the camera software right. The camera on Honor View 20 is very powerful yet delivers inconsistent results due to harsh software, especially the AI which is very good at understanding the surroundings but often leads to animated and over-exposed end-results. I am going to summarize the camera performance in points to make it easy for you. 1) Worlds' first smartphone with 48MP Sony IMX 586 sensor that captures highly detailed shots. You can make a big poster out of a 48MP picture and put it on your wall. 2) Images shot from rear camera are bright and show vibrant colors. 3) The camera is fast, snappy and takes no time to focus on the subject and capture a shot. 4) Images shot even from reduced megapixel count show impressive details and good dynamic range. 5) Standard camera shots fit in more data in the frame than rival smartphones. 6) Most feature-rich camera app. Some really good modes and filters to help you experiment with photography skills. In short, Honor's app is a delight for creative photographers who like to play around with subjects, perspectives, and colors. AI Color and Background color modes for video deserve special applause 7) Brilliant Night mode. Keep your hand steady and the camera will bring in a very good amount of light to brighten up the scene. 8) Super-slow motion- 960fps is an added bonus. It's slightly tricky to always get the desired results but when it works, it creates wonders. 9) The 25MP selfie camera placed in the tiny punch hole shines at capturing detailed shots. As the handset uses a big 25MP shooter, images have slightly better detailing and sharpness as compared to closest rival- OnePlus 6T's 16MP selfie camera. But l must tell you that selfies will not always come out good. There were times when skin looked super soft and the background was completely exposed. If selfies are your priority, there are better selfie-centered phones available in the market at lower price-point.Â  10) Then there's AR lens which is placed last in my list as I really don't understand who would want to place a frog face in place of his/her and make funny faces. The background effects are good though and will light up your Snapchat and Instagram stories. 1) You cannot zoom-in to a specific spot in the frame while using the camera in 48MP resolution. Reduce the resolution from within settings to enable real-time zoom-in and zoom-out. 2) The camera on Honor View 20 fails to capture the warmth in the scenes. Images come out bright but mostly focus on blue hues and lack soul. For instance, the above image show very poor dynamic range and looks rather dull. 3) The AI mode on a camera can make you look like a kid again. The camera algorithms soften the skin way too much and the end result is artificial or you can say highly edited images. Â  4) The portrait effect is inconsistent. The edge detection and background blur are not always at the point. 5) You cannot capture images with Night mode every time as the camera makes you wait for about 6 seconds. When shot in low-light in standard mode, the images show grains and great loss in details. 6) Daylight images could have more dynamic range. Â  I am not yet over with the camera of Honor View 20 as the phone also has a secondary 3D TOF camera, something OPPO offers with its current flagship device- R17 Pro. The camera works as a range imaging system to measure the distance between the smartphone and the subject. The information collected is applied in creating depth of field and in many real-world applications like 3D Shaping, 3D Motion-controlled gaming, 3D Mapping and a lot more. You can play some interactive games backed by 3D TOF camera on a big screen by simply connecting the View 20 with a TV via HDMI cable. Honor View 20 is powered by Huawei's Kirin 980 AI processor; the most powerful chipset ever came out from the house of Huawei. The world's first 7nm mobile AI chipset with dual NPUs combined with 6GB and 8GB RAM and snappy 128GB and 256GB UFS 2.1 storage, makes for lag-free mobile user experience. The View 20 feels as fast as Mate 20 Pro; however, Honor hasn't got the tactile feedback right. The sluggish vibration feedback just makes the phone feels weird and not of a flagship class. As far as gaming performance is concerned, you can run the most graphics heavy game on this phone without worrying about any glitches or dip in performance. There's GPU Turbo 2.0 and graphics processing acceleration technology that ensure glitch-free gameplay sessions. The phone also did not touch any extreme heat levels as the underlying â€˜NINE Liquid Cooling Technology' keeps the temperature rise in check to keep the smartphone cool. Honor View 20 runs on Huawei's latest Magic 2.0.1 UI deployed on Android Pie. The user interface can be a deciding feature to buy or not buy this smartphone. There's no doubt that the Magic UI is feature-rich, snappy and come with all the goodies of good Android skin. However, it just cannot match the smoothness and ease-of-use of Stock Android and OxygenOS per se. The latter two are far optimized and pleasing to use than Huawei's Android skin and makes for a better end-user software experience. If you have used Huawei's EMUI before, you will quickly recognize the iOS-like skin where all the apps are placed on the home screens. You can also change the UI and opt for the standard â€˜Drawer' like Android user interface from â€˜Home Screen Style' settings. Honor offers some really useful apps like Phone Clone, Simple mode, Ride mode, Gestures, Storage cleaner, App Twin, etc. These powerful apps let you explore all the benefits of a modern Android UI. Huawei's HiTouch is also offered to make e-commerce simpler during everyday use. Simply hold two fingers on any image on the display and the phone will tell you what it is and from where you can buy the specific artifact. Honor View 20 really shines in the network connectivity department. Backed by a â€˜Triple-Antenna Wi-Fi' technology, the phone offers solid internet and call connectivity. Huawei's technology prevents the signal weakening when you accidentally block the phone's receiver while making a call, playing a game or simply clicking a picture. The technology also prevents loss in connection while playing online games. As far as battery life is concerned, the View 20 can last a day with one full charge on moderate usage. If you can't stop playing PUBG or streaming videos on the edge-to-edge display, keep a power bank or charger handy. I must mention that Huawei's Supercharge technology is fast and can charge the phone from zero to 100 percent in less than an hour. With many industries first, Honor View 20 comes across as the most feature-packed flagship smartphone in its respective price-point. It is also the best smartphone ever came out from the house of Honor. The punch hole display is innovative and makes View 20 a great mobile device for gaming and video streaming. Another major highlight of Honor View 20 is its crazy 48MP rear camera aided with a 3D TOF sensor. Sadly, the 48MP sensor doesn't quite live up to the hype of being the first ever massive sensor on a smartphone. Still, View 20 offers the best overall camera performance in sub 40k price segment. The software performance of the handset can be a deal-breaker for users who are fond of clean stock Android UI. As far as battery life, processing speed, multitasking, connectivity, and gaming are concerned, the View 20 is no less than Huawei Mate 20 Pro, Samsung's top-end Galaxy Series and every other high-end flagship handset available in the market. Overall, Honor View 20 is for consumers who are always ready to test the new technology and don't want to compromise on the features. When compared to its closest rival- OnePlus 6T, View 20 is just slightly better because it offers a more feature-packed camera, better battery life, and microSD card support. OnePlus 6T is a clear winner in the software department and even in the display performance to some extent as the AMOLED panel offers a better user experience than View 20's LCD screen in terms of color reproduction and viewing angles.

      " Every gaming smartphone is a flagship smartphone, but every flagship smartphone is not a gaming smartphone. A gaming smartphone is a device with state of the art SoC (CPU, GPU) more RAM, better thermal solution, and lastly a striking design, which distinguish it from the typical smartphone.     The Asus ROG Phone is the first gaming device from Asus with well-known ROG (Republic of Gamer) branding. I have been testing the smartphone from the last few days to find the justification for the Rs 69,999 price tag. Is this the smartphone that you should consider as your next smartphone or the first gaming smartphone? Let's find out.  Display: 2160 x 1080 pixels FHD+ 90Hz refresh rateSoC: Qualcomm Speed-binned Snapdragon 845 with Adreno 630 GPURAM: 8 GBROM: 128 GBPrimary camera: 12 MP + 8 MP (Super wide-angle)Selfie camera: 8 MPBattery: 4000 mAh with fast charging support (30W)Water resistance: IPX4 splash proofCooling solution: 3D Vapor-Chamber CoolingSound: Dual stereo speaker setupLighting: ASUS Aurasync RGB LightingSIM slot: Dual nano-SIM slot The Asus ROG Phone is one of the unique looking smartphones in the market. The amalgamation of the glass and metal build gives a unique look to the smartphone and also offers better heat dissipation. The Asus ROG Phone has a rear-facing fingerprint sensor with a dual camera setup flushed inside the body with no visible camera bump. The volume and the power buttons are on the right side, whereas the special DOC connected (dual type-C port) is on the left side, which can be used to attach accessories like AeroActive Cooler. The back panel of the ROG Phone is made using Corning Gorilla Glass 5 with ASUS Aurasync RGB Lighting (activates in boost mode). Overall, the Asus ROG Phone might not be the best-looking smartphone in the market, but it is one of the unique looking devices for sure. The Asus ROG Phone, hands down has the best display that I have seen in the recent past. The ROG Phone has a 6.0-inch OLED display with 18:9 aspect ratio, offering 2160 x 1080p resolution, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 6. The display offers 1ms response time with 90Hz refresh rate. As a matter of fact, the Asus ROG Phone is the world's first smartphone with an OLED display to provide 90Hz refresh rate. Going a bit more into technical aspects of the screen, the phone offers 108.6% DCIP3 coverage with 100000:1 Contrast Ratio. The display also supports FHD HDR content on various video streaming platforms like YouTube, Netflix, and Amazon Prime Videos, thanks to Widevine L1 certification. Coming to the real-world applications, due to the higher-refresh rate display, I was able to notice smoother animations compared to every other smartphone (with 60Hz refresh rate). I also played some games which offer ~90fps, and I thoroughly enjoyed the gaming on the ROG Phone. The smartphone has a dual front-facing stereo speaker setup with a dedicated 3.5 mm headphone jack with DTS:X 3D surround sound support. I have to say; the ROG Phone has the best sounding speaker on any smartphone (in terms of loudness and sound clarity). The Asus ROG Phone has an 8 MP selfie camera on the front and a dual primary camera setup with a 12 MP RGB sensor and an 8 MP Super wide-angle lens. The camera setup on the ROG Phone is identical to the Asus ZenFone 5z, the affordable flagship smartphone from Asus. With respect to hardware perspective, the Asus ROG Phone has the Sony IMX 363 sensor, which is being used on the Google Pixel 3. The sensor offers an f/1.8 aperture with optical image stabilization, which helps to capture steady shots and videos in the low-light environment. Coming to the actual camera performance, the ROG Phone can capture good looking images with great details in the daylight condition. What amazed me is the fact that the camera performance on the ROG Phone is identical to the ZenFone 5z, which costs 1/3rd of the price of the ROG Phone. The images taken on low-lighting conditions tend to deteriorate in color and details. In some instance, the camera struggles to capture enough details, again with contrast to other high-end smartphones at this price point. In fact, Poco F1 can take better pictures in low-light situations compared to the ROG Phone. Same goes for the selfie camera as well, which works like a charm in the well-lit environment, and struggles in the low-light condition. The ROG Phone is definitely not a premium camera smartphone. As the phone has potent hardware, the company could further improve the camera performance via software updates. Without a doubt, the Asus ROG Phone is one of the most powerful Android smartphones with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC. The smartphone is powered by a speed-binned Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 SoC, where the four high-performance cores are clocked at 2.96 GHz with Adreno 630 GPU. Do note that the Adreno 630 GPU on the Asus ROG Phone with 710 MHz frequency, identical to the other smartphones with the standard Snapdragon 845 SoC. Asus has created a new profile to enhance the gaming performance of the ROG Phone, called X Mode. X Mode is similar to the game-boost mode, which is generally found on other smartphones, which free-up the CPU, GPU, and RAM and channelize everything to the game or app that is opened at the time. I ran a couple of benchmarks with X Mode turned on, and there was a slight improvement in the overall performance of the device, with respect to CPU and CPU. However, I did not notice any kind of difference while playing graphics intensive games like Asphalt 9, Critical Ops, and PUBG. AeroActive Cooler, which comes in the retail package does help the device to cool-down faster while playing games. However, as the AeroActive Cooler has a fan, it does consume a bit of a battery. Here are the Geekbench results with X Mode and without X Mode. On single core CPU performance, the device scores 2531 on X Mode and 2483 points on normal mode. Here are the AnTuTu results with x Mode and without X Mode. The ROG Phone scores an overall score of 254695 points on X Mode and 252504 points on normal mode. With respect to GPU performance, the devices score 126122 points on X Mode and 126061 points on normal mode. The Asus ROG Phone, without a doubt, can play any Android game with flying colors. However, most of the Android games offer 30fps, and Critical Ops was the only game that provides 90fps performance for utilizing the true 90Hz refresh rate display on the ROG Phone. The ROG Phone has a massive 4000 mAh battery. The speed binned Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 does impact the battery performance, where I ended up charging the device at least twice a day with normal usage (surfing web, YouTube, and social media). Battery life should not be an issue on the ROG Phone, as the device supports super-fast 30w fast charging, which can refuel the battery from 0 to 100% in less than 80 minutes. Playing games and running CPU intensive apps does not impact the charging speed, which is again a highlight of the smartphone. Keeping aside the gaming-phone concept, the Asus ROG Phone is a perfect flagship smartphone. IPX4 water-resistance certification, super-fast charging, 3.5mm headphone jack with a dedicated DAC, faster chipset with 8 GB RAM and 128 GB internal storage are just some of the highlight features of the smartphone. However, the smartphone misses out of some of the features, which could have made the Asus ROG Phone, the best Android smartphone. Here are some of the features that I would like to see in the next generation ROG Phone. Â  Â  A gaming smartphone powered by Android OS cannot get better than the ROG Phone at this point. It has the fastest chipset (at the time of launch), one of a kind OLED display with 90Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time. The smartphone ships with AeroActive cooling add-on, which helps to sustain peak performance for an extended period of time. Though the ROG Phone is a perfect gaming smartphone, there are no games on Android eco-system, which can take benefit of the state-of-the-art hardware specs that the ROG Phone offers. Yes, at this point of time, the ROG Phone is one of the fastest smartphones in the market, and this equation is going to change in the next few weeks, especially after the launch of smartphones with Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 SoC, which offers better performance and battery life compared to Snapdragon 845 SoC. Asus ROG Phone is for those, who require the absolute performance, a dynamic design, and a bunch of other features which no smartphone offers. However, if you are looking for a smartphone that just performs like the ROG Phone (95%), then smartphones like Poco F1 and even the Asus ZenFone 5z seems like the right choice. Asus ROG Phone is a no-compromise gaming smartphone. Go for the ROG Phone for the absolute performance.\n",

      " Samsung has finally reinvented its mid-range smartphone lineup to fair up against the competition in the Indian market. The company' new Galaxy M series is specially designed to fight the likes of Xiaomi, Honor and Asus's budget smartphones which are currently ruling the budget and mid-segment market in India.  Samsung was clearly losing its grip in the same segment from quite a while. As a result, the company decided to refresh its affordable smartphone lineup and have replaced its Galaxy J and On series with the new Galaxy M series. The Galaxy M series has been announced in the Indian market at a starting price of Rs 7,990. The newly introduced Samsung Galaxy M series comprises of the Galaxy M10 and Galaxy M20 smartphone. The Galaxy M10 is the entry-segment device that carries a starting price tag of Rs 7,990, whereas, the mid-tier Galaxy M20 smartphone carries a starting price tag of Rs 10,990. The Galaxy M10 2GB RAM/16GB storage variant is priced at Rs 7,990 and the 3GB RAM/32GB storage variant is retailing at Rs 8,990. You can grab the latest affordable Samsung offering from Amazon.in or Samsung.com.Â  We got to use the Galaxy M10 for a while and here are our initial impressions of the new smartphone.  Samsung Galaxy M10 looks and feels good in hands but offers nothing special in terms of overall design. The device is made out of plastic which appears to be slightly low in quality but it can take a beating and can survive some falls from low height. Samsung has used a glossy rear panel on the Samsung Galaxy M10 smartphone and it is good to see that even with the shiny back it picks up very fewer fingerprints as the other glossy devices do. No Fingerprint scanner Coming to the placement of the keys, the Samsung Galaxy M10's left panel has the SIM card tray and the right panel has the volume rockers and the power key. The lock key has an ideal thumb placement which makes it easy for us to unlock the device after picking it up. The 3.5mm headphone jack for headphones connectivity and a microUSB port for charging and data transfers are placed at the bottom panel of the smartphone. If you look at the rear panel, you will be able to see a dual-lens camera setup which is stacked vertically on the top left corner. Just below the camera is the LED flash which will help you to capture low-light images. Sadly, there is no fingerprint scanner on this device. Taken as a whole, the device offers a basic design factor which is not really eye-grabbing; however, it makes up for the looks by offering an attractive display panel. Samsung Galaxy M10 boasts a tall 6.22-inch Infinity-V display panel that offers HD+ resolution. Just to recall, Samsung has released its new display panels including the Infinity-O, Infinity-V and Infinity U display back in 2018. You get a waterdrop notch on the top of the display that accommodates the front camera of the device to captures selfies and for video calls. The display offers an optimum screen brightness which does not tend to stress the eyes even with maximum brightness levels. While streaming videos on YouTube, the display will max out at 720 pixels and not 1080 pixels but it still offers a good picture quality. The colors produced by the display are neutral and the content doesn't get oversaturated. It is a beautiful display that is suitable for media consumption and you will enjoy watching movies and videos on the device. Samsung Galaxy M10 runs on an octa-core Exynos 7870 chipset which is a mid-range processor by the South Korean tech giant. The processor onboard is based on 14nm architecture and it clocks at 1.6GHz. There is a 3GB of RAM that takes care of all the multitasking. In terms of storage, the device offers a total internal space of 32GB which you can expand later to up to 512GB via an external microSD card slot. We used the smartphone to carry out some general tasks such as internet surfing, streaming videos and even for some light graphics games and didn't experience any hiccup in its performance. We still need to push the smartphone to its limits to find out how it performs with extensive tasks at hand. We will share a comprehensive review of the device soon with you. In the software department, the Galaxy M10 ships with Android 8.1.0 Oreo out-of-the-box based on Samsung Experience 9.5 skin on top. The device offers a neat UI which is easy to operate and gives a smooth user experience. The Galaxy M10 might also receive the Android Pie update in August this year. This was reported earlier by the Samsung Members app and the update could be announced in the coming months. The new Experience UI is smooth and works just fine for most of the part. The Galaxy M10 sports a dual-lens rear camera panel that comprises a 13MP primary sensor that has an f/1.9 aperture paired with a 5MP secondary Ultra-wide sensor that has an f/2.2 aperture. To capture selfies and for video calls, the device uses a 5MP selfie camera that has an aperture of f/2.0. The camera is not the best part of the Galaxy M10. It captures average image quality in ample lighting situations. The images captured show minimal details. You will be able to notice some noise in the images shot in dark, low dynamic range and washed out results in bright lights. And while the wide-angle lens also captures sub-par pictures, it's a good addition and will come quite handy to capture landscape shots. We will put the Galaxy M10's camera to test for detailed testing in our comprehensive review of the smartphone. Backing up the Galaxy M10 is a decent 3,400mAh non-removable Li-Ion battery unit. With a single charge and moderate usage, the device lasts more than half a day. You get a standard 5V charger in the box which takes around 2 hours to charge the smartphone completely. We will test the battery of the device with extensive tasks and will check how long it lasts. Stay tuned with us to read a detailed review of the latest affordable smartphone by Samsung. Samsung has up the game in the affordable segment with the release of Galaxy M lineup. Both the Galaxy M10 and the Galaxy M20 offers some impressive set of specifications and features which makes them a good rival against the other affordable smartphones such as the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro, Redmi Note 6 Pro, ZenFone Max Pro M2, and others. Both the devices are a sweet deal for the price range they are selling for. Like we mentioned earlier, we will use the smartphone thoroughly so that we can share our comprehensive review with you.\n",

      " The race for offering the highest screen-to-body ratio is getting fierce each passing day, as major manufacturers have come out all guns blazing with their unique designs. But, the notch on top of the display has remained constant. At least in most of the cases. The size of the notch, however, kept shrinking and it was just a matter of time that Samsung joined the party.  After resisting the notch phenomenon for almost a year, the South-Korean giant finally jumped the bandwagon of notched screens with its latest Galaxy M series of smartphones. The company announced two new smartphones - Galaxy M10 and Galaxy M20, specifically for the Indian market. We got a chance to play around with the Galaxy M20 a few days before the launch. Priced at Rs 10,990 (3GB/32GB) and 12,990 (4GB/54GB), the smartphone comes with a big screen, an Exynos 7885 octa-core chipset, and a dual rear camera setup with a wide angle lens. But is it the best smartphone in the segment? Let us break it down for you.  Beautiful yet sturdy Design-wise the Galaxy M20 is a sturdy device. The company has used hard plastic rear which makes is resistant to accidental falls and smudges. The Galaxy M20 is by no means on the slimmer side, due to its massive battery. But, the smartphone feels good to hold as it gives a good grip and a sense of durability. The chunky Galaxy M20 will be an ideal choice for people who often drop their phones. It might save you a lot of money that is spent repairing the damages. Overall, it is a pretty well-rounded smartphone in terms of design and could give other devices in this segment a run for their money. Samsung hasn't used its signature Super AMOLED panel on the Galaxy M20 in favor of a normal 6.3-inch LCD panel. Although it might sound downgraded, the display panel comes with a Full HD resolution which makes for an impressive viewing experience. You might miss the dark blacks on the S AMOLED panels, but that's forgivable considering the price of the device. This the first time, Samsung has used its Infinity-U display which means the notch on the top is u-shaped, drawing less prominence. The bezels are also pretty slim which makes this display ideal for multimedia consumption. The Samsung Galaxy M20 is fueled by a huge 5000mAh battery. The battery sure lives up to the expectations one would have. We managed to use the device for a whole day, and the phone still managed to save 26 percent of juice. Our usage included playing a few high-end games, listening to music, browsing the internet. If you are a moderate user, then the device might work for at least a day and a half before you seek out for a charger. In case of a hardcore user, you might need to charge the device before going to bed. The brilliant battery performance is complemented by the company's fast charging tech. The Galaxy M20 takes a little over one hour to fully charge. You can also get a few hours of talk time by charging it for 15-20 minutes. Bringing the fast charging tech to the Galaxy M20 is something to be appreciated, as not many devices come with this functionality in this price range. Dated software The new Galaxy M20 runs the dated Android 8.0 Oreo, which is a letdown given that Android 9 Pie is already out for months and has been rolled out to many smartphones. While Android Oreo isn't a bad operating system, but if the company is planning to take on the dominant Chinese rivals, it needs to upgrade its software front as well. The software also comes with some bloatware, which could hamper the performance of the phone in the long run. The company is expected to roll out the Android Pie update for the new phone in August, but making it available out-of-the-box would have been a different experience altogether. The Galaxy M20 comes equipped with a dual rear camera that comprises a 13MP + 5MP sensors along with an LED flash. The 13MP is the primary lens, while the 5MP sensor allows you to capture ultra-wide shots at 120-degree angles compared to the normal 78-degree angles seen on other smartphones. We were pretty disappointed by the camera performance of the device. The images captured in good lighting conditions came out decent but lacked details. The images also show some noise and fall short of the dynamic range and sharpness. The wide angle shots also looked a bit grainy. For low light photography, the Galaxy M20 wouldn't be a good option. The images lack details and sharpness which is a bit disappointing. Â  The Galaxy M20 features a fingerprint sensor housed on the rear panel of the phone. But due to the large form factor of the phone, we often found ourselves reaching out for the fingerprint sensor. It feels a bit uncomfortable and if you are someone who has small palms, you wouldn't want to go through this process to unlock your Galaxy M20. The sensor is fast and reliable most of the time, but we noticed that the scanner failed to register the fingerprint and we had to re-tap it unlock the device. As an alternative, the company also provides an option to unlock the device through face recognition, but we all know that isn't as reliable as the fingerprint scanning. Aggressive pricing With the new Galaxy M20, Samsung might hit the right chords with budget-conscious users in India. Starting at a price of Rs 10,990, the Galaxy M20 is probably one of the most aggressively priced Samsung devices till date. As the company aims to go head-to-head with the already dominant Chinese brands and re-claim its throne in the Indian market, the Galaxy M20 seems like the best way to kickstart proceedings. Well, this might not be the best smartphone in this segment but is surely one of the best offerings this price segment has seen in recent times. The device will be pitted against the likes of devices such as the Realme 2 Pro, Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, Moto One Power, and others. But, the brand value that Samsung brings with itself will play a huge role in the success of the Galaxy M series. Samsung has offered a well-rounded smartphone at an affordable price, making it a great value for money. The user response is yet to be seen, but in our opinion, the company has finally taken the right path with its latest M series of smartphones and should continue to bring more and more products that cost less but don't compromise on the specifications front. For people who've always believed in Samsung should definitely try this one out. Both the variants of the device are clear winners in our opinion and will definitely make for a good value for money. With the new M series, Samsung has proved that it means business and its future roadmap for affordable smartphones seems bright.\n",

      "|Updated: Monday, January 21, 2019, 11:55 [IST]\n",
      " Micromax was off the grid for some time but still managed to be the only homegrown brand to stand against the aggressively priced smartphone from the Chinese OEMs. The company unveiled its Infinity line of smartphone for the Indian market. The series includes two smartphones: the Infinity N12 priced at Rs 9,990 and Infinity N11 for Rs 8,990.    We got the Infinity N12 for review, and we tested the device for over a week. The smartphone sports a 6.19-inch HD+ IPS display that offers an aspect ratio of 18:9. It is powered by 1.3GHz Quad-Core MediaTek chipset paired with 3GB of RAM. But is it enough to bring back the company in the frontline of budget smartphones? Let's find out.  In terms of aesthetics, the Infinity N12 is one of the most good looking devices in this price segment. It is probably the best looking smartphone Micromax has ever produced at this price. It comes in three color variants - Viola, Blue Lagoon, Velvet Red, and we got the blue variant for review. The front panel packs a huge display that covers the most of real estate up front. The display also has a notch along with narrow bezels running along the edges, but the chin is pretty thick. On the sides, you get the volume rockers, power key, and the SIM card tray. The device has the usual set of USB ports and the audio jack, along with the speakers and a microphone. The rear panel is built out of plastic and offers a dual-color tone. But unfortunately, all the mirror finish back panels end up being a fingerprint magnet, so is the case with the N12. The rear also houses a dual camera along with a fingerprint sensor in the center, followed by Micromax branding. The smartphone is compact enough for single hand usage, but you might find it difficult to pull down the notifications bar. Overall, the design of the Infinity N12 is really impressive and it seems that the company is finally catching up with the trend of dazzling smartphones. Speaking of the display, the Infinity N12 packs a 6.19-inch HD+ display with a 720 x 1520 pixel resolution and an aspect ratio of 18:9. We wouldn't call this the best display in this price segment, but it still makes for an average viewing experience. The color reproduction isn't that great and we felt the sharpness was a bit off. Also, the reflective nature of the screen makes it unconvenient to use in direct sunlight. Overall, the display of the smartphone isn't one of its best traits, and there are other devices in this price range that offer better display. The smartphone comes equipped with a dual rear camera setup that comprises 13MP + 5MP sensors backed by an LED flash. The company claims to have integrated the cameras with artificial intelligence. The camera app is really easy to use, and switching between the modes works like a charm. We pushed the camera to its limits and found out that the performance was pretty underwhelming. We noticed that the images taken form the camera lacked details and sharpness. Also, the color gamut is limited due to which the colors in the image appear far from original. The images taken in well-lit conditions were clear and had an ample amount of detail, but the low-light shots showed a lot of noise and lacked details. As for the selfie camera, the device features a 16MP sensor which does a pretty good job of taking selfies. The camera offers modes like FaceCute and Beauty mode that makes the user's face spotless. The front camera also offers portrait mode that offers a bokeh effect, however, we noticed that the camera struggled to accurately detect the edges. Overall, the camera performance was a setback, and it would be hard to recommend this device over the likes of other smartphones in the price segment if your first priority is taking pictures. Under the hood, the Micromax Infinity N12 is powered by a 2GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio P22 processor paired with 3GB of RAM. It has 32GB of internal storage capacity, which is expandable using a MIcroSD card. The smartphone works smoothly while usual tasks, however, there could be few bumps while firing up high-end games or heavy applications. The company has added a DuraSpeed feature that boosts the apps by shutting the apps running in the background. But, honestly we hardly noticed any change after turning on the feature. Also, you wouldn't want to play high-end games on the smartphone as it struggles to keep up with the pace of such games. But you can play mild games without any lag or stutter, and the device won't show any signs of heating as well. The smartphone runs Android 8.1 Oreo, which offers near stock experience, but the company could have gone ahead with Android 9 out-of-the-box. The company has promised to roll out the latest version for the device, which might make the experience better. The best trait of the Infinity N12 is its huge 4000mAh battery. During our time with the device, we managed to use the phone for a whole day without seeking for a charger. Our usage included gaming, social media activity, playing multimedia. For a moderate user, the device would easily last for more than a day. Unfortunately, the battery doesn't support fast charging which means the device will take around two hours to fully charge. Overall, the Micromax Infinity N12 qualifies as a decent smartphone, however, the company will have to do something extra to lock horns with aggressively priced Chinese smartphone brands. The smartphone comes with a good-looking design, and has a brilliant battery backup. It sure has some flaws, but if you look beyond those, you get a fairly-rounded device. Also, purchasing the smartphone is pretty easy as it is available through both online and offline stores. In our opinion, the device still has a lot of areas to improve upon, but we appreciate that the company is trying to catch up with the latest trend and came up with a device like the Infinity N12. but, it would be hard to recommend the device over the likes of smartphones like the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro, Realme 2, Nokia 5.1 Plus which fall in the same price segment.\n"

      "|Updated: Friday, January 18, 2019, 10:16 [IST]\n",
      " Taiwanese tech giant Asus had a good run in India in the year 2018. The company unveiled some impressive handsets catering to the needs of budget, mid-range and premium smartphone users. The company's handsets- ZenFone Max Pro M1, ZenFone 5Z and the one-of-its-kind ROG gaming smartphone were the headline grabbers last year and have been received quite well by the audience in the Indian market.    Towards the end of 2018, Asus released two new smartphones targeting the budget smartphone buyers in the country. The company introduced ZenFone Max Pro M2 and the ZenFone Max M2 smartphones. We have reviewed the ZenFone Max Pro M2 and today we are focusing on ZenFone Max M2 in this review.  The ZenFone Max M2 looks identical to ZenFone Max Pro M2 smartphone. The device is big and has a notched display up front. Unlike the Max Pro M2, Zenfone Max M2 has a metallic rear panel with matte finish held by a plastic frame. The matte finish gives the device a premium look and it hardly picks up fingerprints which further reduces the need of cases. Coming to the placement of keys and ports, the SIM card tray is placed at the left panel of the smartphone, whereas, the power key and the volume rockers are placed on the right panel. While the bottom panel of the device stores the microUSB ports for charging and data transfers, the top panel houses the 3.5mm headphone jack for wired headphone connectivity. The phone has is a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner which has an ideal positioning to unlock the device in a jiffy. The rear panel also houses the dual-lens camera setup stacked vertically at the top left corner. As far as ergonomics are concerned, the button placement is perfect but the Zenfone Max M2 is not an ideal phone for one-hand use. It is tad wider and also feels slippery in hands. Â  The Asus ZenFone Max M2 comes with a big IPS LCD display panel that measures 6.3-inches and offers a screen resolution of 720 x 1520 pixels. The display has an aspect ratio of 19:9. The display resolution is pretty standard what we see in the affordable smartphones these days. The IPS LCD screen sports a notch on top, similar to the ZenFone Max Pro M2 that houses the front camera paired with an LED flash along with a bunch of sensors including the notification LED. The LED glows orange while the device is being charged and turns green while receiving general notifications. The display is bright and vivid with the color temperature being slightly on the warmer side. The big display panel does enhance the viewing experience but a higher resolution panel is missed. The only drawback is the display is that it maxes out at 720 pixels while streaming videos online on YouTube and other platforms. Notably, Asus has not used any reinforced Corning Gorilla Glass protection of the ZenFone Max2. It would have been appreciated if the company has applied any Corning Gorilla Glass protection for the display like it used for the ZenFone Max Pro M2 smartphone. Â  The Asus ZenFone Max M2 sports a dual-lens rear camera module that comprises a 13MP primary sensor with an f/1.8 aperture accompanied by a 2MP secondary lens used for depth sensing. To capture selfies and for video calls, the device features an 8MP front snapper that has an aperture of f/2.0. The front camera is also accompanied by an LED flash to brighten up selfies in low-light. Speaking about the camera output, the device manages to capture decent images with ample lighting around; however, the performance in challenging light situations is not up to the mark and not at par with the competition. What's truly interesting here is the 4K UHD video recording feature. It's definitely a standout feature for this handset and makes Zenfone Max M2 a good deal for users who prefer shooting videos than taking pictures. As far as the front camera is concerned, it also delivers average looking selfies but supports AI bokeh mode which can capture some decent shots in good lighting situations. Â  The ZenFone Max M2 makes use of an octa-core Snapdragon 632 chipset which is paired with 3/4GB of RAM to take care of the multitasking. This is a significant upgrade from the usual Snapdragon 430 chipset which the predecessor of this device the ZenFone Max M1 packs. The Snapdragon 632 chipset is the recent entry-segment processor which Qualcomm had announced back in June 2018 and it brings over 40 percent improvements over the Snapdragon 626 SoC. The device does not lag while carrying out day-to-day tasks such as web surfing, calling and some light gameplay. Also, we did not experience any noticeable device heating issues with this handset. Like we mentioned earlier, the ZenFone max M2 features stock Android UI and runs on the Android v8.1 Oreo. The software is the same as we have seen on the ZenFone Max Pro M2 and the device does come with some pre-loaded third-party apps such as Facebook, Messenger, and Instagram. One of the major advantages of being a stock Android device is that they come first in line to receive the Android updates and security patches. It is expected that the device will receive the Android Pie flavor sometime in the future; however, there is no tentative date for the same. The software is pretty neat and offers a clean UI with no forced skin on top. Â  Just like its sibling, the ZenFone Max M2 also packs a big battery unit. It comes with a 4,000mAh non-removable battery which is bundled with a 10W charging adapter. The battery backup of the device is quite impressive. The device gives a backup of over a day with a single charge and easy-moderate usage such as surfing the internet or watching movies and with some light gameplay which is quite impressive. With extensive usage, you might need to plug the smartphone again towards the end of the day. The ZenFone Max M2 is a good entry-segment smartphone which not only carries a reasonable price tag but also offers some decent specifications. The device carries a price tag of Rs 9,999 for the 3GB RAM with 32GB storage variant and Rs 11,999 for the 4GB RAM and 64GB storage variant. At this price point, the device competes with Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro, Honor 9N, Realme 2 and others. The device is a perfect deal if you are looking for stock Android, good design and a long-lasting battery backup.\n",

      "|Updated: Friday, January 18, 2019, 10:31 [IST]\n",
      " Vietnam-based smartphone maker Mobiistar, recently launched the X1 Notch smartphone for the Indian market. The device is priced at Rs 9,499 and can be purchased through offline stores. It comes in three color options: Gradient Shine, Midnight Black, and Sapphire Blue. And, we got the Gradient Shine variant for testing.    We used the device for a week and it's time we pass our judgment. So, if the X1 Notch managed to catch your attention, what follows will clear your doubt whether or not to shell out your money for this new offering.  Â  Â  Aesthetically, the Mobiistar X1 Notch will surely catch some eyes. It looks premium, thanks to glass finish on the rear panel which is actually plastic. But, the phone actually feels good to hold with rounded edges that make the gripping easy. The front panel has a 5.7-inch display which also comprises of a notch that houses an earpiece, front camera, and the ambient light sensor. The bezels aren't slim and the chin is also pretty thick. The right side holds a power key along with the volume rockers, while the left side has a SIM card tray that can accommodate two SIM cards and one microSD card together. On the top, we get a 3.5 mm audio jack, while the bottom side has the speaker grille, microUSB port, and primary microphone. Coming to the back panel, the device has a camera setup aligned vertically, and a fingerprint sensor in the middle which is quick and reliable, followed by the branding. Overall, the X1 Notch is a well-designed smartphone with a dazzling rear panel that gives it a premium look and feel. The design is one of the strong points of this phone, given the asking price is pretty low. The smartphone sports a 5.7-inch display with HD+ resolution and 292ppi. We were a bit disappointed by the thick bezels and a big notch, but that's forgivable considering this is a budget smartphone. The display quality is decent and is bright enough to do the trick in direct sunlight. The touch is responsive most of the time and the color reproduction is also fine. The text is sharp and colors also look properly balanced. Overall, the display quality is decent, but you might not want to watch high-definition videos on this screen. It would still be counted as one of the better displays in this segment. On the software front, the Mobiistar X1 Notch runs on Android 8.1 Oreo with company's skin atop. The device gives a near-stock experience and works smoothly. The touch sensitivity is also decent, however, we did notice that the device failed to register our touch gestures in more than a few instances. We also noticed some lag while launching some heavy apps or switching between applications on some occasions. The software also gives users the option to use Face Unlock as their primary biometric authentication method. But, the device struggles to unlock the device in low light conditions, so we would suggest users opt for the fingerprint sensor to unlock the device. Overall, the software of the device could have been better and smooth. But, if Mobiistar plans on rolling out updates on a regular basis, this wouldn't be a huge issue. The X1 Notch comes equipped with a 13MP rear camera accompanied by an LED flash. The company claims that the camera is powered by artificial intelligence and will set the colors according to the scene in the frame. The camera app offers a lot of filters and modes such as Facebeauty, Night, Panorama, HDR, and Pro mode. We clicked few pictures with X1 Notch and found out that the images taken in well-lit surroundings are clear with an ample amount of details. However, the camera fails to impress when it comes to taking pictures in the dark, even with the night mode on. The rear camera can also capture videos in full HD resolution which look decent with good detailing. The camera also supports electric image stabilization (EIS). Speaking of the front camera, the device features a 13MP front-facing camera which is also powered by AI. It also supports the bokeh mode something that's missing from the primary camera. The front camera is also capable of taking full HD videos. The bokeh effect option is good but it would have made more sense on the rear panel compared to the selfie camera. The selfie camera is pretty much the same as the rear camera in terms of quality. Some shots look good but few show a lot of noise in low-lighting conditions. Overall, the camera performance isn't something that would be the selling point of this phone. It takes decent images but disappoints at some points. We have seen better cameras in this price segment, and it would be hard to recommend the X1 Notch over its competition on the optics front. Under the hood, the device is powered by a 2GHz quad-core MediaTek Helio A22 chipset paired with 3GB of RAM and 16GB/32GB internal storage which is expandable up to 128GB using a microSD card. The device can take care of day-to-day tasks easily, but we did notice some stutter while navigating or switching between the apps at times. Also, you wouldn't want to play high-end games on the Mobiistar X1 Notch as the device wouldn't be able to do justice to such games. But you can mild games smoothly, and the device won't show any signs of heating as well. The smartphone is fuelled by a 3020mAh battery which can keep the device running for a day of moderate usage, but you might need a charge by the end of the day. We managed to use the device for a day that included gaming, social media activity, playing multimedia. For a moderate user, the device wouldn't ask for a charge for a whole day. Overall, the Mobiistar X1 Notch is a good smartphone for the much-crowded budget segment. You might feel that the device is a bit overpriced for the specifications, but since it's targetted to the offline market, it makes for a good value for money. The smartphone comes with brilliant design, good display, an average set of cameras, and decent battery life. It surely lacks a good UI, but it wouldn't be a problem if the company pushes timely updates. If you look beyond the flaws of the smartphone, the X1 Notch could be a good alternative. But, if you are open to buying a smartphone online, it would be hard to recommend the device over the likes of Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro and the Honor 9n which also fall in the same price segment.\n"

      "|Updated: Wednesday, January 16, 2019, 14:42 [IST]\n",
      " Huawei might be going through a tough time in international markets for various reasons; however, the company's sub-brand Honor has given a good start in India at the start of the year 2019. Honor has today unveiled the company's first handset for 2019 in affordable price category- the Honor 10 Lite. Priced at Rs. for the 4GB + 64GB variant, the smartphone is aimed at young tech-savvy smartphone users who don't want to compromise on looks and performance.    Honor 10 Lite is loaded with latest trending smartphone features and takes on highly popular Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro and Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2. As I have also reviewed the other two handsets, the following review will inform you about the good, bad and worse of the three handsets to make a better decision. Let's start with the key specifications of Honor 10 Lite.  Honor 10 Lite sports a 6.21-inch screen offering Full HD+ (1080p x 2340p) resolution. The handset runs the company's EMUI deployed on latest Android Pie OS. For the camera, Honor 10 Lite features a 24MP selfie camera and a 13MP + 2MP dual-lens rear camera setup. The smartphone is backed by the company's in-house Kirin 710 chipset paired with 4GB and 6GB RAM configuration. For storage and battery, Honor 10 Lite offers 64GB internal memory with microSD card support (up to 512GB) and is powered by a 3,400 mAh battery unit. The above-mentioned specifications look very compelling when you consider the price of the smartphone. But as we know that on-paper specs don't always translate to complementary real-world performance, we subjected the handset to our standard testing routine by using it as a daily driver. Here's what we found out. The first thing that most of us notice while buying a smartphone is the design and how the phone actually feels in hands. Having said that for a smartphone priced at Rs. , Honor 10 Lite is a looker. It is crafted beautifully and doesn't come across as a budget device. Honor 10 Lite can be used with one hand as the handset is very lightweight and ergonomic. Honor has done a wonderful job of packing a massive screen in such a compact form-factor, thanks to Chip-on-Film technology and 1.8mm bezels on sides of the screen. Unlike Redmi Note 6 Pro's metal body, Honor 10 Lite is made out of plastic but it's of very good quality and does not make the device look and feel cheap by any means. Some key design elements that make Honor 10 Lite the best-looking budget smartphone are; Dewdrop notch, massive all-screen front, gradient color, and the 3D curved edge design. The only design letdown is the glossy back panel that is a fingerprint magnet and also catches scratches easily. The Midnight Black variant I am using has already gathered multiple scratches at the back panel. Make sure you use the handset with the bundled clear case in the package if you want to avoid any damage to your phone. The power button and volume rockers are placed on the right side of the handset and offer satisfactory tactile feedback. The fingerprint scanner is also placed at the sweet spot for a struggle-free unlocking experience. Overall, Honor 10 Lite is a premium looking smartphone available at budget price-point. If design is one-of-the biggest deciding factor while buying a mobile device for you, Honor 10 Lite is our pick in sub-15k price-point. The big 6.21-inch Full HD+ display makes Honor 10 Lite a good device to stream videos and to play games. The 91% screen-to-body ratio makes video streaming and gameplay quite a delight. Honor has used an IPS LCD panel which is bright and crisp; however, it is not as vibrant as the screen on Redmi Note 6 Pro. Therefore, the gameplay and video playback lacks a certain punch which makes the viewing experience more immersive. I also noticed a slight bluish tint while using the screen for everyday purpose. I would recommend using the phone with the vivid mode (Under Display settings) for videos, gameplay and even for regular use. As far as screen durability is concerned, Honor 10 Lite uses some protection glass but we haven't got the official branding of the screen protection used by the company. We will update this space as soon as we get the correct information. Overall, there are some issues with the screen but they are not deal-breakers when you consider the starting price of Rs. 14,000 for this handset. As I have mentioned in my first impressions of the smartphone, Honor 10 Lite is the company's first smartphone to boast AI in both front and rear cameras. There's a massive 24MP selfie camera with Sony IMX 576 sensor and a 13MP + 2MP rear camera setup. Honor has added a lot of AI in the cameras. The front camera can recognize more than 200 scenarios across 8 categories. The rear camera can recognize over 500 scenes in 22 categories and can automatically apply the best settings for a perfect shot. Does this make Honor 10 Lite a great budget camera phone? The answer is No. The camera performance is rather underwhelming. The AI implementation is pretty good but the end results are mostly average. What this means is that the camera is quite smart at understanding different elements in the frame such as Blue Sky, Greenery, Flowers, Beach, Stage performance, Night, Indoor and Snowscapes but the images just don't turn out good. The images shot by the rear camera in daylight are very crisp and show good detailing but the software is too harsh at bringing out sharpness. The end result can be pretty animated. The AI mode helps to some extent but then it has a tendency to saturate the colors. Some shots even show bluish tint. Portrait shots are pretty good for the budget price-point but show some inconsistent blurring at various spots. There's no 4K video recording and 1080p at 30fps videos are very shaky as the phone doesn't support OIS. What's good is the newly added â€˜Night mode'. The shots are vibrant and show impressive detailing. Images show significant noise but clarity is where shots stand out. You can read more about Honor 10 Lite's camera in my detailed comparison of the handset with Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 and Redmi Note 6 Pro. 24MP Selfie Camera is also pretty average I was expecting some amazing results with the 24MP selfie camera but it also delivers pretty average results. The selfies lack that crispness you would want to see from a 24MP shooter. The images look soft and colors look washed out in daylight. Portrait mode is a savior for the phone as it delivers some good results but only when the lighting is good. Honor 10 Lite is the first sub 15k handset by Honor to be powered by the in-house Kirin 710 chipset. On papers, the processing unit delivers 75% better speed and 130% boost in graphical performance when compared to company's Kirin 659 CPU. Honor 10 Lite also gets GPU Turbo Tech 2.0 which ideally should improve the gaming performance of the handset. In real life, this budget smartphone feels really snappy. Even the games ran smoothly and there were far fewer jitters during gameplay when compared to the company's previous budget handsets. Game titles like Shadow Fight 3, Guns of Boom ran without any lags. The handset even managed to run graphically intensive game Asphalt 9 pretty smoothly. You will not face any issues with everyday tasks like calling, video streaming, photo-editing and while running multiple applications at a time. Overall, Honor 10 Lite offered slightly better user experience when compared to Redmi Note 6 Pro and Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, the handset's biggest rivals. On the software side, the smartphone runs on EMUI 9 based on the latest Android Pie. While there are not any major differences between EMUI 8 and EMUI 9 in terms of UI and features, the latest iteration of Google OS adds some useful software features like Digital Wellbeing and Gestures navigation. Digital Well-being is a great tool to keep a track of your smartphone usage. It offers important insights like hours spent on individual apps, screen-on time and a lot more. Gestures navigation feels half-baked on Honor 10 Lite but delivers a seamless full-screen user experience. Coming back on the EMUI 9, it is very well optimized and packs in some neat tricks under its sleeve. You can choose the home screen layout, set magazine style wallpapers, swipe down to access universal search bar, customize display color tone and can even tweak the display resolution to save some battery life. Besides, the EMUI 9 also offers some other useful apps like Password vault, Ride mode, Smart assistance, etc. Last but not least, EMUI 9.0 also brings in HiTouch feature, which is basically added to give you an experience of Visual Shopping. While browsing web pages on Honor 10 Lite, you can simply hold two fingers on any particular image and the phone will find similar products by fetching online database. The feature can come quite handy in everyday routine. Make sure you have configured it otherwise the popup to configure the feature can be pretty annoying. Software, display, and cameras are really important but what truly makes or breaks a phone is battery life, call quality, and connectivity features. For battery backup, Honor 10 Lite draws its power from a 3,400 mAh battery unit which is considerably smaller than the standards set by Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 and Redmi Note series handsets. In my testing, the handset rarely managed to last for one full day. I had to refuel the battery cell twice a day and you would also need to do the same if you stream videos, play games and click a lot of pictures. And sadly, the handset does not support fast charging. If battery life is your number one priority, look for other options. As far as audio is concerned, the speakers on this budget handset are not very powerful and mostly feel underwhelming. Call quality, on the other hand, is pretty solid. One useful connectivity feature is Wi-Fi Bridge that lets you share your phone's Wi-Fi network with other devices. Honor 10 Lite offers a premium in-hand feel and works brilliantly as a multimedia device, thanks to the crisp 6.21-inch edge-to-edge display with a tiny notch at center. At a starting price of Rs. 13,999, the smartphone also offers the latest Android OS and a snappy chipset. However, if the camera and battery life qualify as your major priorities, I would recommend the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro.\n"

      " Huawei has launched the 2019 version of its Y9 smartphone for the Indian market. the device is priced at Rs 15,990 and will be available through the e-commerce website Amazon.in. The company is also bundling free Boat Rockers Sport Bluetooth headphones along worth Rs 2,990 with the device. The smartphone comes with a huge 6.5-inch display with a notch on the top and has dual rear as well as front cameras with AI capabilities. But is it worth shelling out your money? Let's break it down for you.  Crisp Display  The Huawei Y9 (2019) sports a 6.5-inch FHD+ FullView Display panel with a 1080Ã—2340 pixel resolution and a 19.5:9 aspect ratio. The screen is ideal for multimedia consumption and the colors look crisp and vivid. Also, the color reproduction is also very impressive and we were satisfied with the viewing angles. The sunlight legibility is decent and the brightness level is enough to offer a good experience. Smooth Performance The smartphone is powered by the Kirin 710 which is an octa-core processor built using the 12nm process. It is in direct competition with the Snapdragon 710 which is built using the latest 10nm process. the processor is backed by 4GB of RAM and 64GB of internal storage. The Kirin 710 is capable of running day-to-day tasks with ease without showing any signs of lag or stutter. However, we are yet to fire up some high-end games on the device which will tell us the actual performance of the chip. But, we are sure that the CPU is capable of handling multitasking and switching between the apps without breaking a sweat. Huge Battery The Huawei Y9 measures 162.4 x 77.1 x 8.1 mm, but still manages to pack a 4000mAh battery. The AI software also optimizes the battery making the device less power-hungry. The device can easily last more than a day if you are a moderate user, but if you are someone who's constantly on the phone, you might need a charge before going to bed. Old software The smartphone runs Android 8.0 Oreo, which is a setback, considering that Android 9 Pie is already been available for several months. The Android 8.0 Oreo is by no means a bad OS, but it would have been welcomed addition on the software front. Also, the software comes with some bloatware, which makes the device a bit sluggish after a few months of extensive usage. Lacks Type-C In a time where mid-range smartphones are getting support for Type-C charging methods, Huawei stuck to the old-school MicroUSB port. This is a bit disappointing given the fact that there are other devices in this segment with the Type-C functionality. Due to the lack of resources, the device also misses out on the fast charging. It would have been great if the company added the fast charging tech to the Y9, reducing the charging time and cutting down reliance on the power sources. The biggest selling point of the Huawei Y9 are the two dual camera setups. Yes, the smartphone has a 16MP + 2MP rear cameras with f/2.0 aperture and 12MP + 2MP front cameras f/1.8 aperture. The cameras come with AI capabilities allowing them to recognize the scenes in the frame and set the best-suited color filters. The cameras allow you to take pictures in Portrait mode from both front and back cameras. The app also offers modes like Night mode, Pro mode and AR lens among other features. The images show a good level of detail and the color reproduction looks impressive. We will be pushing the device's camera in our comprehensive review, but during our short stint with the device, we learned that the camera has potential and could click some great pictures. With the Y9 (2019), Huawei has come out strong the mid-range segment. The company has priced the device aggressively bringing some unique features to the table. The dual AI cameras on both sides make it a standout device in this price segment. If you are someone who has a thing for smartphone photography but don't want to shell out a lot of money, this could be a great alternative. If you are okay with a phone that has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, alongside a decent camera performance, then spending Rs 15,990 doesn't sound like a bad deal at all.\n",

      " Huawei's sub-brand Honor is kicking off the year 2019 in India with the launch of a new feature-packed budget smartphone. The company is set to launch the successor to Honor 9 Lite on January 15, 2019, in India. To recall, Honor 9 Lite introduced four cameras to budget smartphone segment in the year 2018 and was quite well received by consumers in the Indian market.  Honor 10 Lite will fight the likes of Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, Nokia 6.1 and Realme handsets. These smartphones are priced under Rs. 18,000 price-point, which has gradually become one-of-the most competitive and interesting price segment in India. Honor seems very well prepared for the battle. Honor 10 Lite features a big 6.21-inch screen with a very good screen-to-body ratio. The smartphone also offers a massive 24MP selfie camera, premium design and runs on the latest Android Pie. We have just started using the new Honor 10 Lite and it feels quite promising. Here's our first-hand experience with Honor 10 Lite. Please note that this is just our first impressions with the handset and a detailed review will follow later.  Premium look and feel Honor 10 Lite is a strikingly good-looking handset for its price-point. If I don't reveal the pricing, I doubt anyone will categorize it as a budget device. The dewdrop notch, the gradient color, and the 3D curved edge design gives Honor 10 Lite a very seamless and premium look and feel. Even though the handset flaunts a big 6.2-inch screen, it can be used with one hand as the overall width of the device and the curved edges make it very comfortable to hold. The rear panel is made up of plastic but has been given a glass finish. The plastic doesn't make the phone look cheap, something which we noticed in the case of Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2. The power button and volume rockers placed on the right side offers a very good clicky feel. The fingerprint scanner is also placed at the sweet spot for a struggle-free unlocking experience. Overall, I really liked the design of Honor 10 Lite. It might be the best-looking handset in its price-point and will certainly please smartphone enthusiasts for whom design is one-of-the biggest deciding factor while buying a mobile device.  Coming onto the front, Honor 10 Lite sports a big 6.21-inch Full HD+ display with a dewdrop notch. The all-screen design and sleek form-factor make this handset look really eye-catchy. The display is fairly bright and vibrant making Honor 10 Lite a good budget smartphone for multimedia lovers. I streamed 1080p videos on this handset and even played some graphically rich game titles. The gameplay and video playback experience were good as the 91% screen-to-body ratio completely fills up the display for an impressive viewing experience. As far as screen durability is concerned, Honor has added a protective glass layer but the company hasn't specified the exact brand information. Having said that, we cannot put into words the amount of stress the display on Honor 10 Lite can bear but we expect it to be at par with at least Corning Gorilla Glass 4 or 5. Honor10 Lite is the company's first smartphone to boast AI in both front and rear cameras. The smartphone sports a massive 24MP selfie camera with Sony IMX 576 sensor. The camera can recognize recognizes more than 200 scenarios across 8 categories. What this means is that the camera can quickly customize the basic settings to better capture different elements in the frame such as Blue Sky, Greenery, Flowers, Beach, Stage performance, Night, Indoor and Snowscapes. As far as the rear camera is concerned, Honor 10 Lite sports a dual-lens camera- 13MP + 2MP system working on f/1.8 and f/2.4 aperture lenses respectively. As per Honor, the rear camera can recognize over 500 scenes in 22 categories and can automatically apply the best settings for a perfect shot. The AI works quite well on the camera systems and you can capture some crisp and detailed shots in daylight. I am not entirely blown away with the results in indoor and low-light conditions though. Pictures captured in standard â€˜Photo' mode by front and rear cameras show noise and softer details. Portrait shots show some inconsistent blurring on non-human subjects. On the other hand, the newly added â€˜Night mode' is quite impressive and tends to bring up a lot of details in the images shot in low-light. It also keeps a check on noise levels to a good extent. Stay tuned for a comprehensive review of Honor 10 Lite's camera hardware. Honor 10 Lite offers some solid on-paper specs. The smartphone runs on EMUI 9 based on the latest Android Pie. It is backed by Huawei's in-house Kirin 710 octa-core CPU. The company will unveil 4GB and 6GB RAM variants with 64GB in-built storage that can be expanded to up to 512GB via microSD card. I am currently testing the 4GB RAM variant and it feels really snappy. Even the heavy games ran smoothly as the handset ships with GPU Turbo 2.0 that improves the graphical performance. Android 9 combined with EMUI 9 offers some useful features such as Digital balance, Password Vault, Ride mode, Smart assistance, etc. While everything else seems just top-notch, Honor 10 Lite is backed by a humble 3,400 mAh battery unit which seems less beefy when compared with rival devices like Redmi Note 6 Pro (4,000 mAh) and Asus Zenfone Max pro M2 (5,000 mAh). However, Honor says that the battery on Honor 10 Lite can actually offer the same level of battery backup due to handset's efficient antenna design and hardware-software customization. We will compare the battery life of Honor 10 Lite with that of Redmi and Asus handsets to test such claims. Honor 10 Lite has managed to impress us in a short period of time. It seems like a well-rounded budget smartphone for consumers who don't want to compromise on design, display and software part. We are yet to fully evaluate the handset's camera, battery and multitasking performance. Stay tuned on Gizbot for our comprehensive review of the smartphone.\n"

      " Asus had a good run in the year 2018. The brand managed to deliver some of the best Android smartphones in the budget, mid-range and even flagship price-point. While the budget handsets- Zenfone Max Pro M1 and Zenfone Lite 1 impressed us with their aggressive pricing and good hardware, Zenfone 5Z set new benchmarks in the value flagship category. Right before the end of the year, Asus also introduced the one-of-its-kind ROG phone that became every gamers' dream gadget in the year 2018.    Asus ended the year 2018 by launching a successor to the well-received Zenfone Max Pro M1. The Zenfone Max Pro M2 is another solid offering in the Indian budget smartphone landscape. The smartphone takes on Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro and offers even better on-paper specifications. Zenfone Max pro M2 packs in a beefier battery unit, speedy CPU and runs stock Android. This seems like the right recipe to win the hearts of the tech-savvy smartphone enthusiasts in the Indian market. However, as well know that on-paper specs do not always translate to best-in-class real-life performance, we tested the smartphone for over a week as our daily driver. Here's what we found out.  For a smartphone that comes at a starting price of Rs. 12,999, Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 looks quite appealing. It offers a smooth design layout with nothing fancy all around. The device features an all-plastic casing with a glossy rear panel. At first look, the rear panel appears to be made out of glass, however, let the looks not fool you. It is only when you hold the phone in hands that you will realize it is an all-plastic construction. Keep the Redmi Note 6 Pro or Nokia 6.1 Plus side by side and you will instantly feel the difference. Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 feels somewhat less premium in hands. However, the plastic construction doesn't affect the device's ability to resist damage. Instead, Zenfone Max Pro M2 might be one of the most durable budget smartphones in the market. The phone fell from my hands twice on a hard surface and it did not suffer any noticeable damage. The front of the handset features Corning Gorilla Glass 6 making Zenfone Max Pro M2 the most affordable handset with the latest and toughest glass from Corning. Fingerprint Magnet The rear panel on ZenFone Max Pro M2 picks up fingerprints from the moment you pick up the phone. It's actually a task to keep the surface clean. We would suggest using a case with the device. The rear panel houses the primary dual-lens camera setup stacked vertically at the top left corner. There is also a fingerprint scanner mounted at the rear with ideal positioning allowing the index finger rest naturally on it. This makes it easy to unlock the device once picked up. The fingerprint lock is fairly easy to set up and it unlocks the smartphone in a jiffy. Coming to the placement of keys and ports, the volume rockers along with the power key is placed at the right panel of the smartphone, whereas, the left panel houses the SIM card tray. The bottom panel accommodates the 3.5mm headphone hack for audio output, speaker grills and a standard microUSB port for charging and data transfers. Â  Â  Even with a big display panel and a massive battery unit, I didn't find the device bulkier. It is somewhat easy to operate the smartphone with one hand; however, reaching the edges might need some efforts. The curved edges allow for a good grip, though, we would suggest you use a case as the glossy rear panel is slightly slippery. Overall, ZenFone Max Pro M2 features a sturdy design which might not give the most premium feel in hands but somehow looks premium due to its glossy plastic back and minimal looks. Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 sports a tall 6.3-inch full HD+ IPS display panel that has an aspect ratio of 19:9. The screen offers a resolution of 1080 x 2280 pixels and a peak brightness of 450 nits. The display sports a mid-size notch on top which stores the front camera along with an LED flash and a couple of sensors. It also has a notification LED which glows orange when the device is being charged and green for general notifications. The display is surrounded by thin bezels all around including the chin which allows for a maximum display surface while consuming media. Speaking about the luminance levels, the device offers optimum brightness indoors; you will experience some issues watching content on the device under direct sunlight. You can also tweak the color temperature as per your requirement from within display settings. The IPS LCD display panel on the smartphone offers vivid color output and you will enjoy your viewing sessions on the device. The taller display offers decent viewing angles and is apt for media consumption and streaming shows and movies online. While watching videos on the device we the device didn't hiccup even once and it played along the content quite well. The big display does enhance the viewing experience. Corning Gorilla Glass 6 at budget price-point The display is protected by a Corning Gorilla Glass 6 on top for screen protection and Asus claims that it can survive up to 15 drops from a height of 1m. This is definitely going to help in case of accidental falls. Notably, the smartphones in this price segment usually offer Corning Gorilla Glass 3/4 and we hardly come across the mid-tier devices featuring Corning Gorilla Glass 6. This adds a bonus point for users who will buy the Max Pro M2. Â   Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 packs a dual-lens rear camera setup like most of the affordable smartphones available in the market. The rear camera module comprises of a 12MP primary Sony IMX486 sensor that has an aperture value of f/1.8. The camera is paired with a 5MP depth sensing secondary lens. The camera hardware is good but the results are subpar due to the poor camera software. The autofocus and tap to focus are not at point and it affects how the camera captures the overall scene. For starters, the autofocus is quick but it is not effectively calibrated for non-human subjects. What this means is that the camera on Zenfone Max Pro M2 shows effective autofocus skills when you are framing humans; however, the results are not very satisfactory when you are capturing non-human subjects. On the other hand, the camera captures good landscape shots and pleasing bokeh shots in daylight. Â  The camera also fails to capture real-life colors in low-lighting and also show noise. The primary lens delivers warm colors if light sources are placed close and simply fails to differentiate the color difference in light sources placed farther. The images also look washed out in low-light conditions. Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro did a better job in similar conditions. The rear camera can record 4K UHD videos and you can also set a specific time limit to record the videos, which is a smart feature Easy-to-use Camera Interface The camera UI on Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2 is very fluid and easy-to-use. The various modes and settings are laid out in an easy-to-use format. Besides the Auto and Night mode, the rear camera supports HDR, sports and Pro mode as well which you can access from the top left a corner of the app. You can easily navigate throughout the camera UI to access modes and fine tune the settings to get the best out of the camera Selfie Camera Performance Up front, the ZenFone Max Pro packs a 13MP camera that has an f/2.0 aperture and is accompanied by an LED flash. The LED flash allows us to click selfies in low-light situations. The details captured by the front camera are of good quality and it brings a noticeable improvement over its predecessor the ZenFone Max Pro M1. The picture quality during the video calling is also better as compared to its predecessor. It may not be the best selfie camera in the market but it does a pretty decent job in capturing images. Summing up all, Asus has offered good camera hardware; however, the underlying software hampers the overall rear camera performance in real-life tests. Â  The major highlight besides the big battery of the ZenFone Max Pro M2 is the stock Android UI. The neat UI offers a smooth user experience and is not gimmicky. If Asus manages to offer timely updates, this device can be the best affordable option or stock Android fans. Being a stock Android phone, Zenfone Max Pro M2 only offers some stock Google apps. It runs on Android 8.1 Oreo, though, the company has promised an Android Pie update for the device. One of the badly missed features on this smartphone is the â€˜hide notch' feature. Yes, there is no option to toggle the notch off or on, hence, you will have no other option than to watch videos with a notch insight Â  As for the hardware, you get a Snapdragon 660 chipset onboard which is combined with Adreno 512 GPU to render all the high-resolution graphics and it does a pretty good job while doing the same. Notably, the processor is powerful than what one of its major rivals the Redmi Note 6 Pro offers. The Redmi Note 6 Pro comes with a Snapdragon 636 chipset and is selling for a similar price point. So, you get a snappier Snapdragon chipset which is clubbed with 3/4/6 GB of RAM for multitasking. Carrying out with day to day tasks is not an issue and it offers a lag-free performance throughout. No heating issues found while watching videos continuously for a longer period of time or with moderate gameplay sessions. Speaking of gaming, the device does a pretty good job in handling some graphically intensive games. PUBG, Asphalt 9 and some other game titles can be played with no or very little lag. In terms of storage, the device comes in two storage options including 32GB and 64GB and is further expandable up to 2TB via dedicated microSD card slot, which is another highlight feature of the handset. Â  The ZenFone Max Pro M2 houses a mammoth 5,000mAh battery unit; sadly, there is no fast charging support. This means you will need to wait a while to get the fuel back up. Speaking of the charging speed, the device takes around 2.5 hours to charge from zero to 100 percent. A lesser charge time would have been really appreciated. In terms of backup, the big battery does hold up a bit longer than the usual batteries found on the other mid-range smartphones. Though it is not exceptional and you get a backup of one complete day with a single charge. Mind you, if you are binging on your favorite shows or movies or even getting on with your gameplay sessions you will need to plug it in again. With simple day-to-day tasks such as web-surfing, playing music and other activities the device will last for an entire day and even a bit more depending upon the screen-on-time. Â  ZenFone Max Pro M2 is a worthy successor to the ZenFone Max Pro M1. It is durable, runs stock Android and also offers best-in-class CPU. The smartphone also offers a dedicated microSD card slot and packs in the beefiest battery in the budget price-point. It is only the camera performance, where the smartphone failed to impress us. Competitors like Redmi Note 6 pro and Honor 8X are better camera devices in the overall camera performance. Having said that, if you are looking for a budget smartphone with long-lasting battery life, no-compromise in storage and connectivity, durable design and stock Android, Zenfone Max Pro M2 is the answer. If the camera is your top priority, you should check out the other mid-rangers such as the Redmi Note 6 Pro and Honor 8X.\n",

      " Meizu made a comeback in the Indian market with three new smartphones. The lineup comprised a flagship - M16TH, and two budget smartphones - the m6T and the C9. While the flagship was priced at Rs 39,990, the m6T and C9 will be sold for a price of Rs 7,999 and Rs 4,999 respectively.    We got the chance to test out the m6T, it comes with a MediaTek octa-core processor paired with 3GB/4GB of RAM, and has a 5.7-inch IPS LCD display. The device runs on Android 7.0 Nougat with company's Flyme UI skin atop. The device comes in three color options including Black, Champagne Gold, Coral Red. To find out whether the device worth buying, check out our review.  Â  Â  Design wise, the m6T is similar to the E3, but at a cheaper price. The body is entirely made of plastic, unlike the latter which uses metal construction. he left side has the dual-SIM slot which can also accommodate a microSD card, while the right side packs volume rockers and power button. On the top, there's a 3.5mm audio jack and the bottom holds the speakers and MicroUSB port. The build quality of the device seems to be good, and the plastic feels premium. We did, however, notice that the side keys wobble a bit. The device is lightweight, weighing only around 150 g. There's a good quality scratch resistant glass coating on the display which doesn't have a notch The front panel has an earpiece alongside the proximity and light sensors, and a notification LED. The rear panel houses a dual camera setup which is placed vertically which is supported by an LED flash. The company has also added a fingerprint sensor for added security, which we found is pretty fast and reliable. Overall, the design of the smartphone is really good and is one of the best aspects of the phone. Speaking of the display, the smartphone comes with a 5.7-inch IPS LCD display that has a resolution of 1440 x 720 pixels, and a pixel density of 282 PPI. The display qualifies as a decent one which can register 10 fingers simultaneously. It is scratch resistant, but there's no mention of a Gorilla Glass from the company. The colors come out vivid on the display and color reproduction is somewhat accurate. It also allows you to customize the display settings. The smartphone also offers good viewing angles making the viewing experience even better. It has a good level of brightness and the sunlight legibility is also satisfactory. The only setback here that the device lacks a Full HD panel, which is forgivable given the asking price is pretty low. The software on the Meizu m6T is probably its weakest point. It still runs the dated Android 7.0 Nougat which is wrapped under the FlymeOS skin. The UI doesn't offer an app drawer which is fluid most of the times. And, thanks to the FlymeOS, you get a lot of customization options. The software also allows for gesture control like the double-tap-to-wake or skipping music titles while the screen is off. Additionally, the 'Smart Touch' allows you to create a point on the display which can be used for navigation options defined by the user. The company's proprietary OS is also calibrated with several sensors like the brightness sensor. The software lacks the screen unlock mode, and you'll have to make do with the fingerprint sensor which is pretty swift and reliable. Though the m6T isn't a flagship device, it still offers a good camera module for its price. The smartphone comes equipped with a dual camera setup that comprises of a 13MP and a 2MP sensors. The 13MP sensor does the framing and focusing, while the 2MP sensor is responsible for ranging, which offers hardware-level blurring exposing a clear picture with good edge detection. The photos come out good in well-lit lighting conditions. While the night shots are somewhat disappointing. The macro shots are good, and you will notice that the device clearly distinguishes the details. The camera also exposes good colors, but in scenes which are backlit, you might get slightly overexposed. The front camera has an 8MP Samsung 4H7 sensor with an aperture of f/2.0. It takes decent selfies, but you will notice slight noise in dark surroundings. But the camera still produces decent picture quality and you wouldn't have a problem while video calls. The Meizu m6T is powered by a MediaTek's MT6750 octa-core processor paired with 3GB/4GB RAM and 32GB/64GB internal storage which is expandable up to 128GB using a microSD card. The processor here is an upgrade of MT6737 which supports 1080p video decoding. But, since there's no Full-HD display here, it doesn't really make a lot of difference. The company could have used a Snapdragon 430 or Helio P23 instead. But the company tried to overcome that by offering 4GB of RAM. But, it's important to note that the RAM will help the device handle multitasking but it would not boost the performance of the processor. The device handled the day-to-day tasks with ease, and we didn't notice any lag while navigating or switching between the apps. However, you wouldn't want to play high-end games on the Meizu m6T as it struggles to keep up with the pace the games require. As for the battery, the smartphone is juiced by a 3300mAh battery and thanks to the optimized system and screen, it lasts for a long time. We played videos for half an hour on the device with 50% brightness and the power dropped by 5%. While playing mild games for another half an hour dropped the power by almost 10%. But overall, the device did provide a full day charge after gaming, social media activity, playing multimedia. If you are a moderate user, you won't require a charger at the end of the day. Overall, the Meizu m6T is a potent smartphone in the budget segment. The company has surely made a good comeback in the Indian market. The features this device offers makes it a good value for money. It comes with a good set of cameras, the UI is well optimized, battery life is impressive, and the overall experience is smooth. The camera performance here is good and if you are someone who doesn't want to shell out a lot of money but still wants a well-functioning camera, the Meizu m6T could be a good alternative.\n",

      " OPPO as a smartphone manufacturer is widely known for best-in-class VOOC Flash Charging technology and selfie-centric smartphones. The company sells budget and mid-range smartphones under 'A' and 'F' series in India and has recently added OPPO A7 in its portfolio.    The smartphone is the successor of previously launched OPPO A5 and improves on a number of features to take on other mid-range handsets such as Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, Asus Zenfone Max pro M2, Realme smartphones, etc. Priced at Rs 16,990 the device offers a display with teardrop notch and a massive 4,230mAH battery unit. Despite carrying a mid-range price tag the smartphone offers entry-level hardware which makes it look underpowered when compared to the above-mentioned handsets. But as we all know that the on-paper specs don't always tell the real story, we tested the handset for a week to evaluate its performance. Here's our comprehensive review of the OPPO A7.  OPPO A7 looks and feels like an affordable OPPO F9. The smartphone comes with an all-plastic body, which has been given a glossy finish at the rear panel. Despite the plastic body, OPPO A7 does not come across as a cheap looking phone, and in fact looks premium than some of its competitors. The back panel has curved edges and sides to give the big phone some level of ergonomics. Glossy back panel is an absolute fingerprint magnet Unlike the tending gradient color pattern,Â the smartphone features a slightly glossy back panel with two color options including Gold and Blue. The review unit which we received was of Golden color and it looks pretty good in hands. However, the rear panel on the OPPO A7 is an absolute fingerprint magnet. Like every other handset with glossy rear panel, OPPO A7also picks up fingerprints from the moment you pick it up. You get the dual-lens camera setup and a fingerprint scanner at the rear panel of the device. The camera unit is placed horizontally at the top left corner with golden linings around it. The fingerprint scanner is placed at the center and is placed ideally so that our fingers rest naturally on it while we hold the device. Decent looks but fails to offer something new: Coming to the placement of the keys, the volume adjusters along with the SIM card tray is placed at the left panel of the smartphone. The power key is accommodated at the right panel. It is good to see that the device has keys on both the side panels and no side has been left empty. The smartphone has a microUSB port for charging and data transfers which are placed along with the speaker grille and 3.5mm jack at the bottom of the smartphone. Overall, the Oppo A7 is a good-looking smartphone; however, it fails to offer anything new in terms of design. Â  Â  OPPO A7 boasts a tall 6.2-inch HD+ display panel. The display offers an aspect ratio of 19:9 and has a resolution of 720 x 1520 pixels with a pixel density of 271 PPI. There is a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top for added screen protection. The display is quite vibrant and responsive; however, it is not as crisp as the 1080p displays offered by competitors such as Redmi Note 6 Pro, Honor 8X and Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2. The display on OPPO A7 comes with a teardrop notch up top which accommodates the front camera. Sadly, there's no option to hide this notch within display settings. OPPO A7 is not the best-in-class device to stream videos and play games due to low screen resolution. The videos look good but you will miss the crispness delivered by Full HD screens. Same goes for the games as the device is only good for enjoying casual games. Â  OPPO A7 sports a dual-lens rear camera setup which comprises of a 13MP primary sensor that has an f/2.2 aperture and a 2MP depth sensor with a darker f/2.4 aperture value. The rear camera is paired with LED flashlight. Coming onto the picture quality captured by the rear camera, the images show acceptable detailing in favorable lighting conditions. Color look natural and the camera also feels snappy. You also get a good range of filters and effects to experiment with the images you capture. OPPO A7 may not be the best camera smartphone out there in this price segment, but it definitely is an impressive snapper. The colors captured by the rear camera are balanced and it doesn't animate the images. The bokeh effect produced by the rear camera is also impressive considering that there is just a 2MP sensor for depth sensing. The rear snapper can record 1080p videos at 30fps. However, when it comes to capturing images in challenging light situations the output produced is not that impressive. The camera struggles while capturing images in low-light situations and the output is not up to the mark. Redmi Note 6 Pro and Honor 8X are clearly better camera handsets in this price-point. The front camera on the Oppo A7 packs a 16MP lens which is used to capture selfies and for video calls. The selfies clicked by the front camera are quite appealing and it manages to deliver some good output both in good and challenging light situations. The front camera also has a beauty mode but it animates the images quite a lot. Â  OPPO A7 draws its power from Qualcomm's entry-segment Snapdragon 450 processor clocked at 1.8GHz which is a letdown considering the price point it is selling for. OPPO A7 is a mid-tier segment device; therefore, a mid-range Qualcomm processor such as the Snapdragon 610 or Snapdragon 635 would have made more sense. The processor onboard is further paired with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage. The inbuilt storage on the smartphone is expandable up to 25GB via microSD card slot. I played some games which are not very graphics heavy and didn't experience any noticeable lag during the gameplay. You might experience slight hiccups with continuous game playback and the device warms up a bit during the prolonged gaming sessions. Overall, OPPO A7 is not built for high-end gaming. The smartphone ships with Android 8.1 Oreo out-of-the-box with Oppo's proprietary ColorOS 5.2 skin on top. The UI is very colorful and offers a smooth user experience. The Android skin offers gestures, shortcuts, and some really useful software features that made me like the software performance of this mid-range handset. Â  The smartphone is fuelled by a big 4,230mAh non-removable Li-Ion battery unit with no fast charging support. The device does give a stellar performance when it comes to the battery backup. The Oppo A7 lasts for an entire day with moderate to heavy usage and you will not need to plug in the device twice in a day to refuel the battery. As it misses on the Quick Charge support, it takes over two hours to charge the smartphone from zero percent to 100 percent, which is a letdown. OPPO A7 is a mid-range smartphone that carries a price tag of Rs. 16,990 but packs entry-level processor and a subpar screen. At this price range, other smartphones such as Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro, Nokia 6.1 Plus, Honor 8X, etc. offer better cameras and faster processors. It is very tough to recommend this smartphone as competitors are fat better overall mid-range handsets. Â  Â \n",

      " OnePlus had a good run in the year 2018. The Chinese smartphone manufacturer launched two flagship handsets- OnePlus 6 (May 2016, India) and OnePlus 6T (Oct 2018, India) along with special edition handsets- OnePlus 6 Marvel Avengers, OnePlus 6T Thunder Purple, and ultra-premium OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition.    OnePlus also expanded its presence in the Indian market by announcing company's first R&D facility in India at Hyderabad, new Experience store in the capital and three new authorized offline stores in Indian cities- Bangalore, Mumbai, and Kolkata. If all of this does not clear your doubts about company's big plans for the Indian market, you must know that OnePlus has even joined hands with Reliance Digital to sell its products at Reliance's retail stores for the better offline presence of the brand in Indian cities. So you can now experience the company's flagship smartphones in person before buying them on Amazon.in or through retail stores. Today we are not here to talk about OnePlus' expansion plan for India or company's partnerships with Indian retail chains; we are going to focus on OnePlus most premium product- OnePlus 6T McLaren edition smartphone. It is the company's ultra-premium variant of OnePlus 6T that has been designed in partnership with luxury Race-car maker- McLaren. OnePlus says that the special edition device is a combination of speed, technology, and beauty. This is quite right because this is the first globally available handset with a whopping 10GB RAM combined with current flagship chip- Snapdragon 845 and company's brilliant Oxygen OS Android skin. Besides, OnePlus 6T's battery cell also recharges quickly as the handset ships with specially designed Warp Charge 30 power adaptor. Having said that, and after using both the editions of OnePlus 6T; here's my review of OnePlus 6T McLaren edition. Hope this will help you in settling down on the right variant while buying the OnePlus 6T.  There's something different about special edition phones. These products usually end up being collectibles and are taken with huge interest and excitement over their standard counterparts. Kudos to OnePlus team here as they have kept the trend going on since last few generations of OnePlus flagship phones. It all started with OnePlus 5T Star Wars edition phone followed by OnePlus 6 Marvel Avengers edition and now McLaren edition for the OnePlus 6T. OnePlus 6T McLaren edition might not be the most unique looking flagship phone out there; however, it is still a one-of-its-kind product that will please McLaren fans around the globe. The special edition phone is an instant conversation starter, something I have experienced personally while using the handset. Smartphone enthusiasts and OnePlus fan-boys just couldn't stop themselves from asking questions and admiring the handset. Everyone wanted to experience the device in their own hands. A person in flight even offered his brand new Google Pixel 2 XL in exchange to the review unit I was carrying. Not kidding! When compared with the standard OnePlus 6T, you will find some elemental design changes in the new McLaren edition. The form-factor, dimensions, and the overall weight are exactly the same but the rear panel on the new McLaren edition OnePlus 6T flaunts reflective orange stripes that give the phone its unique personality. OnePlus has used the signature McLaren color, Papaya Orange. The overall Orange-Black color scheme looks very subtle yet eye-catchy. These vibrant Orange stripes flow from the bottom and fade into Black towards the top, exactly at the point where you see the OnePlus logo. Then you will find the â€˜McLaren logo' positioned at the bottom of the phone. The glass at the back panel houses a pattern underneath, which is fused inside the glass with some complex engineering processes. The striking pattern is based on McLaren's choice of carbon fiber material, which is said to be at the heart of all McLaren cars' manufacturing process since 1981. McLaren fans will instantly recognize it and they are the ones that would not think twice while buying this special edition OnePlus 6T. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with this handset. It is super responsive and I never felt the need to kill a single active application in the background. As I have tested the 6GB and 8GB RAM variants of OnePlus 6T, I must tell you that you will not experience any major difference in regular tasks. The 2GB RAM (over 8GB RAM variant) difference kicks in when you try to do everything extremely power intensive at once. For instance, the phone just doesn't slow down a bit even while playing graphically intensive games, shooting 4K videos at 60fps, editing photos and running more than 20 tabs in Google Chrome at the same time. There's simply no compromise in the hardware and software department. You get the best-in-class Snapdragon 845 CPU, 10GB RAM of course and the company's brilliantly optimized OxygenOS with the latest Android OS. It's a combination that will happily serve you for the next two years. In addition to a new paint job and extra 2GB RAM, OnePlus has also improved the charging speed for this special edition handset. OnePlus calls it Warp 30 and it is company's fastest charging tech ever that offers 50 percent extra power compared to OnePlus' Dash charging technology. In the words of OnePlus, Warp 30 can give OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition a day's power in just 20 minutes. In our real-life tests, we found the charger refueling the 3,750 mAh battery from zero to 50 percent in about 25 minutes. The adaptor can charge the battery to up to 65% in about 30 minutes. This is fast but not as fast as OPPO's VOOC charging and Huawei's 40W charging adaptor. In fact, OnePlus's Warp 30 sits at number three spot in the race of Fast charging adaptors. As far as battery life is concerned, OnePlus 6T can last a day with moderate usage. If you can't stop streaming videos and playing games, the phone can only last for 16 to 18 hours on one full charge, which is pretty much at par with the competition. There's technically no change in the camera hardware for the special edition OnePlus 6T. The smartphone flaunts the same 20MP+16MP dual-lens camera setup at the rear and a 16MP front-facing shooter. The camera hardware is pretty capable to capture crisp and detailed shots in favorable and low-light conditions. Portrait image output is good outdoors but the bokeh effect and image quality takes a hit when you are shooting inside. We have done a detailed review of OnePlus 6T's camera performance on our YouTube channel where you can evaluate the portrait camera performance, standard camera output, time-lapse video, 4K video and low-light camera output. Overall, we have experienced some significant bump in camera's performance with some recent OxygenOS updates. I would have loved to see some additional benefits to buyers who would invest in the OnePlus 6T McLaren edition. For instance, the company could have bundled the handset with a pair of headphones/earphones with McLaren branding or have simply added official IP rating for protection against water-dust. While these two things would have added some certain value to the overall package, the price would have increased even further. OnePlus 6T McLaren edition is indeed a powerhouse of multitasking. It is a phone that just doesn't demand any caring and attention to manage RAM and memory. If you are a die-hard McLaren fan and just don't want to compromise on speed and performance (processing, multitasking, and gaming), don't think twice before buying this special edition OnePlus 6T. But if you are looking for the best value for money flagship phone, you must evaluate some important things. What OnePlus 6T McLaren Edition has to offer? A new paint job, extra RAM, fast charging and some extra goodies in the package spiked the price to additional Rs. 6,000 when compared to the standard 8GB RAM + 256GB ROM OnePlus 6T variant. If you do the maths, the price hike is not very steep and actually justifies the overall package for an automotive special edition handset. What competition has to offer? At Rs. 52,000, you can consider a number of smartphones in the Indian market. You have the option to go for Samsung Galaxy S9, Google Pixel 2 XL/ Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy Note 8, LG G7+ ThinQ and other handsets priced around Rs. 52k price tag. These handsets are not special edition variants and come with 4 GB and 6GB RAM for multitasking, which is clearly lesser when compared to 10GB RAM on OnePlus 6T McLaren edition. You will also not find speedy Quick charging speeds. However, you will experience better camera performance and will also get to see microSD card slot and 3.5 mm headphone jack (Galaxy S9+, Note 8 and LG G7+ ThinQ). Moreover, these handsets also offer official IP rating for water-dust resistance (some also offer Wireless charging) which can also be a major deciding factor while purchasing a flagship device. The final decision is entirely yours.\n",

      " Ever since Nokia made a comeback, the company has kept the market busy by launching new smartphones at regular intervals.    The latest device from the company is the Nokia 7.1 which is the successor of the Nokia 6.1 and a tad below the Nokia 8.1. Priced at Rs 19,999, the device comes with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 paired with 4GB of RAM, and an HDR 10 certified display which is the biggest highlight of the Nokia 7.1. But is the display enough to make this a good value for money? Let's find out in our review.  Â  Â  Let's kick off with the design of the phone. The Nokia 7.1 has a glass sandwich and metal frame construction that gives it a premium look and feel. While the device isn't heavy, it still has enough mass to make it feel like a quality product. It borrows a similar design that we've previously seen on other Nokia-powered smartphones from HMD Global. The display takes most of the space of the front real estate, but no thanks to the LCD panel, Nokia couldn't trim the chins further. The front panel also has a notch which is pretty standard in size. Users can also hide it using a black notification bar. The company has housed no physical buttons on the face of the phone, and users will have to make do with the capacitive keys on the screen. However, you do have the power key and volume rockers on the right side. The left side holds the SIM card tray, and the secondary mic and a 3.5mm audio jack can be found on the top of the phone. The bottom side houses the primary mic, Type-C USB port, and the speaker grille. On the rear panel, you will find a dual camera setup with an LED flash and a fingerprint sensor which is followed by the Nokia and Android One branding. Speaking of the display, the Nokia 7.1 packs a 5.84-inch display with a resolution of 1080 x 2280 pixels. It is capable of playing HDR videos thanks to the HDR 10 support. The display is bright and crisp, and the color looks vivid from all the angles. The display quality of the Nokia 7.1 at this price point is something to be appreciated. We played some HDR content on the display and were surprised with the excellent quality. One of the best parts of this device is the software. Nokia going ahead with AndroidOne over Android seems to be working in its favor. The unit we reviewed had Android 9 out-of-the-box installed on it. There's no bloatware, and UI is really smooth and features like the 'Ambient Display' that shows missed calls, messages and app notifications without having to wake up the device, makes life easier. It also has some gestures like turning the phone over will reject a call, while picking up the device will mute the ringtone. The only â€˜non-core' apps found on the device are the Nokia Support, and the Nokia Camera app. But that's forgivable given the fact that every manufacturer has to supply a camera app. The software also comes with a dark mode which darkens all the icons, toggle panels, and natives apps. You also get the Digital Wellbeing feature that allows you to keep track of time spent on different apps, how many times the phone has been unlocked, and the number of notifications on a daily basis. Optics wise, the Nokia 7.1 packs a dual camera setup powered by Zeiss optics and electronic images stabilization. The setup comprises of a 12MP sensor with an aperture of f/1.8 and a 5MP sensor with f/2.4 aperture. For selfie enthusiasts, the company has placed an 8MP sensor up front. We tested the camera, and we found out that images taken in good lighting conditions had an ample amount of details and the colors looked vivid. The camera clicked some impressive bokeh shots as well, offering good edge detection between the subject and the background. We also tried clicking some pictures in the dark and they seemed to have a bit of noise, but the brightness was good. We noticed that the device sometime over-sharpens an image, making the color reproduction dicey. The company has surely made advancements in the low-light imaging with the Nokia 7.1, but there still many options in this segment that offer a better set of cameras. The front 8MP camera also takes decent selfies, although we did see some noise in the images taken in inadequate lighting conditions. But it still makes for a good overall performance. The rear camera is also capable of taking 4K videos with the quality being consistent and smooth throughout. Under the hood, the Nokia 7.1 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor paired with 4GB of RAM. While it sounds like a pretty outdated for this price segment, the performance of the device is actually pretty zippy and smooth. The day-to-day tasks work like a charm and we didn't notice any lag or stutter while switching between the apps or navigating through the main menu. However, you wouldn't want to play high-end games on the Nokia 7.1 as it struggles to keep up with the pace the games require. Even mild gaming on the device made it a bit toasty, which is nothing new on devices that fall under this budget. If HMD rolls out some performance enhancing updates, we might be able to play a game or two of PUBG without roasting our palms. Other than gaming, there were hardly any issues with the performance unless you are a querulous user. It handles the multitasking easily and media playback worked smoothly with breaking a sweat. The smartphone is fuelled by a 3060mAh battery which in our case lasted for around seven hours. Our usage involved playing videos, constant WhatsApp chatting, mild gaming and browsing through social media apps like Instagram and Facebook. The device can easily last a day if you are a moderate user, but if you are someone who's constantly on the phone, you might need a charger by the end of the day. Overall, the Nokia 7.1 is an impressive device with a gorgeous design and a beautiful display. It offers a premium look that you won't find on a lot of devices in this price range. The display quality is something that makes this a stand out product, thanks to the HDR 10 certification. Although we do feel that the device can perform better in terms of graphics-intensive applications, otherwise the device works smooth as butter. The camera quality could have been better as well, but it still satisfactory if we consider the overall package. If we look beyond the minor flaws of the device, the Nokia 7.1 makes for a good value for money. It's highly recommended for people looking for a good screen in a smaller form factor and don't plan on firing up high-end games on their phones.\n"
