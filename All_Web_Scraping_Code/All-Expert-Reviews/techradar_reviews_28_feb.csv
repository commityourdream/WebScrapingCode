Google’s phone has an edge in picture-taking over everything we’ve tested so far.It has the same cameras, dual front-facing speakers, Snapdragon 845 chipset, and 4GB of RAM as the one-hand-friendly Google Pixel 3, but the XL version is the one to consider for its larger 6.3-inch bezel-reduced OLED screen and higher-capacity 3,430mAh battery.Normally, we prefer the bigger screens outright, but the Pixel 3 XL has a hard-to-ignore notch cut out at the top of the display, deeper than the iPhone XS Max notch. It’s a design quirk – controversial among Pixel fans – that’s meant to offer a little more room for notification icons, the time, and the battery life percentage, all flanking the selfie cameras and speaker cut out in the top middle of the phone.It does give you more screen, sure, but not to the extent that the 6.3-inch diagonally measured spec suggests. To us, the 6.3-inch Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus and 6.4-inch Note 9 screens feel a bigger and more immersive, and the forthcoming Samsung Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10 Plus promise to mainstream the punch hole camera for even more screen real estate.Google’s design approach is more functional than fashionable, favoring its selfie twin cameras with a bit of asymmetrical screen distraction.The Google Pixel 3 XL ends up being the best option for people who want photos as flawless as they come on a smartphone, and are already used to a wielding sizable handset. It’s hard to downsize, even if the tighter dimensions of the 5.5-inch Pixel 3 are a better fit for most people. It doesn’t have everything – there’s no microSD card slot or headphone jack – but if you’re willing to embrace the notch design, you’ll get consistently great photos paired with a fairly big screen.Watch our first impressions of the Google Pixel 3 in video form below...Release date and priceThe Google Pixel 3 XL release date was Thursday, October 18 in the US, and November 1 in the UK and Australia, and it launched thereafter is Canada, France, Germany, Japan, India, Ireland, Italy, Singapore, Spain, and Taiwan. Pre-orders started on October 9, right after the New York launch event.The Pixel 3 XL price is $899 (£869, AU$1,349) SIM-free for the 64GB storage variant, and $999 (£969, AU$1,499) for the maxed-out 128GB configuration. If you want more space, you’ll have to turn to cloud storage because there’s no microSD card on Pixel phones.This is a small price hike from the Google Pixel 2 XL by $50 (£70, AU$50), yet cheaper than the iPhone XS Max by $250 (£230, AU$450). It’s still a better value than most flagships out there.DesignThe Google Pixel 3 XL doesn’t push smartphone design in a revolutionary new direction like the new Huawei View 20, but it does see some satisfying change over last year’s Pixel 2 XL. Gone is the glass-and-aluminum back in favor of an all-glass two-tone look. It’s made of shiny glass at the top and a textured matte glass finish for the lower 80%. You get a more seamless transition between the two textures with the soft-touch glass back made of the same Corning Gorilla Glass 5 that protects the front screen. There’s an aluminum frame that binds the front and back pieces of glass together – the only bit of metal you’ll see.The Pixel 3 XL fits into one hand, but takes two hands to operate and it’s a little more slippery to hold than the Pixel 2 XL. The difference isn’t Earth (or phone) shattering, though we did end up preferring the tighter dimensions of the standard Google Pixel 3 for this reason.The all-glass design has two benefits. First, LTE signals travel more easily through a glass phone than an aluminum-backed smartphone. That’s going to become important as phone makers and carriers try to claim superior 5G speeds in 2019. Second, wireless charging is a part of Google’s hardware ecosystem again, something we haven’t seen since the plastic Nexus 6. You’ll find smoother corners on the Google Pixel 3 XL – everything has been rounded off and flattened, giving Google’s Material Design software ethos a foothold within real life hardware. The frame edges are polished and the rear fingerprint sensor is flatter.The smoother design won’t be enough to wow you next to other big phones. This doesn’t have an elegantly curved screen like the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 and the bottom chin stands out next to the iPhone XS Max. Notch or no notch, Google’s design isn’t winning any awards.But the Pixel 3 XL is more functional: It has two selfie cameras, dual front-facing speakers, and Active Edge, allowing you to squeeze the sides of the frame to trigger Google Assistant. We prefer this over a dedicated AI button, something that annoys us about Samsung and LG’s new phones with dedicated, often-mispressed AI buttons.Just know that the Pixel 3 XL doesn’t have a standard 3.5mm headphone jack (exactly like the Pixel 2 XL), though it does come with USB-C earbuds in the box this year. You’re also not going to find a microSD card slot anywhere within the design. The 64GB and 128GB internal storage sizes are set in stone once you order them.There are three muted Pixel 3 XL colors: Clearly White, Just Black and a pinkish Not Pink. We got two reactions from our Clearly White review unit: that it was the most sophisticated hue or that is looked a little cheap and plasticky. Everyone liked the hint of fresh mint color on the power button, a pleasing dab of color that’s exclusive to the Clearly White version.Screen, notch and bezelThe Google Pixel 3 XL has a sizable 6.3-inch OLED screen with a 18.5:9 aspect ratio, a QHD+ resolution, and HDR Support with true black levels. It’s a higher-quality screen compared to the problematic P-OLED Pixel 2 XL screen we found to be desaturated and leave ghosting burn-in.There’s also more display here and less bezel, with an 83% screen-to-body ratio (up from 76%), thanks to a 6.3-inch screen (up from 6 inches). The bigger screen fits in basically the same dimensions of 158 x 76.7 x 7.9mm. That’s some nice progress from the engineers at Google.It’s two steps forward and one step back when you see the notch cut out at the top, however. No one we talked to liked it. A few people said they didn’t mind it too much. That’s as positive as things got. For us, when testing it day-to-day, we found it harder to ignore the deep notch when browsing websites and watching videos. It’s not as easy to overlook as the iPhone X notch.But wait, we found some software tricks to fix this issue: Google’s hidden developer tools menu offers the ability to hide the notch, though the notification icons, time, and battery life percentage are pushed further down. A third-party app, Nacho Notch, is better. It puts all of that information within the blackened notch space. Why this isn’t a part of the phone by default is perplexing.The notch cut out shouldn’t be a dealbreaker if you want the best-in-class Pixel 3 camera and desire your phone at the biggest size possible. The software tricks certainly help."

Switch it on, in late 2018 at least, and it looks similar to an $800/£800-plus phone.Other parts of the design are less flash, of course, and there are a few little compromises to the hardware. However, most issues are trifling things you get used to quickly, like the use of a micro USB port instead of a USB-C.The Honor 8X costs £229.99 (roughly $310, AU$435), and it’s worth every penny. You can order it in the UK from October 10, and we don't currently know whether it'll be launching in the US or Australia.Key featuresAll-screen front, glass back and metal frameGood 1080 x 2340 screenMid-range CPU is biggest sign that this isn't a flagshipThis phone offers great value for money. Arguing against that idea is a tricky prospect.The Honor 8X has a glass back and metal sides, extremely slim surrounds and fairly slimline notch. These factors combine to make the 8X look like a phone several price classes above.It also has a very good Full HD-grade screen, a 20MP and 2MP dual-lens rear camera and a 16MP front camera. Again, they sound high-end for the price.So where are the tells that this is a much more affordable mobile? The Honor 8X has a mid-range CPU that could do with a faster graphics chipset, its secondary rear camera is weak, and the charging socket is a micro USB rather than a USB-C. It doesn’t take good night photos unless you use the AI Night mode either.Given the amount you save compared to an ultra-high-end phone, this seems a fair trade.DesignMetal and glass designmicro USB chargingVery high screen-to-body ratioThe Honor 8X looks similar to some of the most expensive phones in the world, but is a quarter the price. This is not just the point of the phone, it sums up the entire Honor strategy at present. You get more for your money than other recognizable brands.Very high screen-to-body ratio is the particular look the Honor 8X not just emulates, but achieves. When we first turned the phone on, we were slightly shocked. No model to date has offered such an all-screen look at this price.Its front-on appearance really is quite similar to an iPhone XR or OnePlus 6.The Honor 8X’s build is comparable with these more expensive models too. Plates of glass make up the front and back, and the sides are a matte-finish aluminum. There are just a few slight signs this isn’t really in the same class as a 500-1000 dollar/pound phone.Slim borders of plastic sit between the metal and glass parts, and the finish of the back is quite plain. There’s no light-reactive layer, none of the funky gradients seen in some other Honor and Huawei phones. A subtle two-tone band stops it from being plain black, but it took us a while to even notice this was the case.This phone may be two-tone, but those two tones are shades of black.The Honor 8X also feels less dense and expensive than the iPhone XS. Considering the radical price difference, if this was not the case it would seem odd.Honor’s use of a micro USB port instead of a USB-C is the one hardware niggle that sticks out. Value-packed as the Honor 8X is, this price band is USB-C territory in 2018.There’s no official water resistance either, but the Honor 8X is not without extras. The rear fingerprint scanner is very fast and reliable, and 64GB of storage is great at the price. There are spaces for an extra nanoSIM card and microSD card in the SIM tray too, earning it a few extra tech nerd points.The ultra-slim screen surrounds also make the Honor 8X pleasant to use and hold for a phone with a 6.5-inch screen. This is not just for enthusiasts and those with big hands. Like just about every Honor phone, it’s slim too at 7.8mm thick.The factory-applied screen protector is a nice additional touch, although within a few days one part had started to lift off the surface.Approach the Honor 8X with an ultra-critical eye and you can tell this is not an ultra-premium mobile. Build is a small step below the OnePlus 6 too. However, as is so often the case, Honor has done a brilliant job of making a phone comparable to one double the price.Screen6.5-inch 19.5:9 LCD screen, 1080 x 2340 pixelsNotch, which can be hiddenCustomizable color profileThe Honor 8X has a large, very tall 6.5-inch 19.5:9 LCD screen with a fairly narrow notch. Notch-haters can block off the top area with a black bar too.Fresh out of the box the Honor 8X uses a slightly unruly 'vivid' color mode, one not quite as tasteful as that of more expensive phones. Some tones look more sickly than vivid, but switch to 'normal' color mode and you have one of the very best displays you’ll find in a phone for under $400/£400.Color looks accurate enough and well saturated, and as the Honor 8X has an ultra-long Full HD-grade resolution, with 1080 x 2340 pixels, it’s sharp too. It is sharper than the iPhone XR: amusing when you compare their prices.The sheer size of the display makes the Honor 8X seem a true enthusiast phone, well-suited to gaming, video streaming and reading long articles or even books.Top brightness is not as high as that of the phones Honor references with the 8X, phones over $600/£600. However, it is legible on bright days so covers the essentials for a mid-range model."
2,2,u35tRmNR3Ys9KBCZof7vRZ,u35tRmNR3Ys9KBCZof7vRZ,Honor Play review,,na,na,na,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/honor-play-review,,"Honor is well known for making mobile phones that use top-end tech at a more affordable price than a lot of the flagship phone manufacturers, and the new Honor Play is no exception.The phone has already been announced and released in China and the Middle East, but now the device is coming to the UK, and we've got our hands on the phone to test it outWe've yet to score this full review as we don't currently know the pricing (plus there's no clear release date yet) so be sure to check back soon for our full verdict on whether the Honor Play should be your next phone.Honor Play price and release dateIn the UK the Honor Play will cost £279 (about $360, AU$500)Unconfirmed whether it's coming to the US or AustraliaIn the UK and Middle East you can buy it nowYou can buy the Honor Play in the UK and Middle East now – it went on sale on August 30 after the company's IFA 2018 press conference. We’ve yet to have confirmation from Honor on whether the phone will be available to buy in the US or Australia.The price of the Honor Play isn't much more than the Honor 7X, the brand's no-frills budget handset, which costs $199 / £199 (about AU$475), considering how much extra spec you're getting. It's £279 (about $360, AU$500, AED1,299) in the UK, but you'll have to spend a bit more to get the Special Edition versions of the phone.Design and displayThe Honor Play has a full-metal unibody, and a look that's heavily influenced by the design language of the Honor 10. This phone feels even easier to hold in your hand though, as unlike the 10 it doesn’t have a glass back, although it is a touch heavier than the Honor 10 at 176g.In fact, this isn’t a particularly large phone considering it has a 6.3-inch screen in its center. That’s because it has a 19.5:9 aspect ratio display with thin bezels around the edges – and that means there’s a notch at the top of the phone to house the front camera and more.The dimensions of the Honor Play are 157.9 x 74.3 x 7.5mm, but it’s remarkably comfortable to hold in your hand.If you’re not a fan of a notch at the top of your display, you can cover it up so the phone makes the whole section a black bar, but that does feel like a waste of the extra screen real estate. The Honor logo is cheekily snuck into a thin bezel along the bottom of the screen.The notch here is particularly big when you compare it to other phones on the market at the moment, but if you're not fussed about that it shouldn't cause any issues.The display itself is just a Full HD+ panel, but we’ve found the viewing experience to be quite impressive. Colors are good and the screen is clear, with a resolution of 409 pixels per inch. This isn't going to be as good a display as those on the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 or S9 family, but it looks great considering the market this phone sits in.The rear of the Honor Play feels premium to the touch, and you may prefer the grip here to that on some glass-backed devices you can buy right now.The edges of the phone are nicely rounded on the rear, although there are some visible antenna bands to allow for the connection to get into the metal body.Image 1 of 2Image 2 of 2Along the bottom edge there's a USB-C port in the middle, with a 3.5mm headphone jack – yes, there is one on this phone – to the left of it and a single speaker to the right. That’s the only speaker on this device, so it won’t sound great if you cover it up.The fingerprint scanner is on the back of this phone, and while it may not look particularly attractive we found the position made it easy to reach and tap."
3,2,uSKN8vUcXBGTnFhPUrqC7B,uSKN8vUcXBGTnFhPUrqC7B,Huawei Mate 20 Pro review,,na,na,na,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/huawei-mate-20-pro-review,,"In a year where every new phone raises the bar a bit higher that its predecessor, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro has just enough premium features to stand out from the crowd. It’s a powerful smartphone with three rear cameras and a modicum of distinctive style, but its bold signature is a handful of neat tricks you won’t see on other phones until next year. In many ways, it’s a superlative device that gamely competes with the Samsung Galaxy Note 9, Google Pixel 3 and iPhone XS. But its top-tier specs and features demand a top-tier price: the Mate 20 Pro costs £899 (AU$1,599, €1,049, about $1,150), making it one of a couple this year to break the four-digit price point in the US.That lump of change could get you a powerful laptop, DSLR, budget motorcycle or modest vacation. The Mate 10 Pro, released last year, started at £699 ($799, AU$1,099), but the new Mate 20 Pro has joined a few of this year’s other top flagships to become one of the most expensive consumer phone on the market. Inevitably, then, sitting as it does in that top-tier price bracket, the Mate 20 Pro is subject to the question: is it worth all that money?Interested in the cheaper of the two new Mates? Read our in-depth Huawei Mate 20 reviewThe short answer is yes, if your only scale is what other current phones have to offer. Whatever else happened in 2018, phone innovation didn’t, which makes the Mate 20 Pro’s minor improvements and additions more impressive. But let’s delve into the specifics to see why this is pretty great phone perhaps deserves its dizzyingly high price tag.Mate 20 Pro release date and priceThe Mate 20 Pro release date is October 26 in the UK, and November 1 in Australia, it costs £899, €1,050, AU$1,599 (about $1,150). We haven’t heard release dates for other regions, nor official prices, and there are no plans to release it in the US.There’s only one version of the Pro (for now) with 6GB RAM and 128GB of storage. But the other versions in the Mate 20 line – like the 7.2-inch screen Mate 20 X and 8GB RAM and up to 512GB Porsche Edition – offer different performance and form factors if you want a slightly different take on this already-performance-driven smartphone.As has been the case with Huawei, don’t expect this flagship phone to hit US shores - unless you buy an unlocked version from overseas and find a carrier that will support it.Key featuresIf you missed the Huawei P20 Pro earlier this year, you’re in luck: the Mate 20 Pro is a better version in nearly every way. Where the P20 Pro had a main camera, 3x zoom telephoto and monochrome lens, the Mate 20 Pro kept the former two and added a color ultra-wide lens. While this may give its predecessor the edge on low-light and nighttime shots, the Mate 20 Pro is no slouch there, and you’ll love having the option to ‘zoom out’ with the ultra-wide. The Mate 20 Pro inherits the 24MP f/2.0 front-facing camera from the P20 Pro, but expands the front camera suite with more sensors. This stretches its notch to iPhone XS-levels of width, but that’s the price for more dynamic photos unlocking the phone with your face.At 157.8 x 72.3 x 8.6mm, Huawei’s latest phone is just a couple millimeters bigger (and almost a millimeter thicker) than the P20. That makes its 6.39-inch OLED screen larger, too, with resolution that’s higher than the Google Pixel 3 and slightly better than the Samsung Note 9, at least on paper. One of the biggest braggable points, of course, is the Kirin 980 processor, which is debuting on the Mate 20 Pro and its sibling devices. It's the first 7nm chip on Android and second in the market after Apple’s formidable A12, which came packed in the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max. The Mate 20 Pro’s 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage haven’t improved from the P20 Pro, though you can expand the storage via a new proprietary “nanoSD” format card to a maximum of 256GB. But if you opt to plug in a nanoSD for more storage, you’ll have to place it in one of the phone’s two SIM slots (cleverly stacked in an over/under tray inserted next to the USB-C port) and give up dual SIM functionality. These specs are about on par with other flagship smartphones, though the Kirin 980 is speedier than Snapdragon 845 which first appeared in a phone earlier in March. Don’t worry about sapping the battery while you’re putting the new chip through its paces: the Mate 20 Pro comes with a 4,200mAh battery, which lasts as long as you’d think.The Mate 20 Pro has a couple things other phones today don’t, though they’re more party tricks than market-upending features. The first is something phone fans have been eager to try out: an in-screen fingerprint scanner. In theory, this makes it easier to unlock your phone while it’s resting flat than using a back-mounted fingerprint button or facial recognition.The second new trick probably won’t get used much, but in a pinch, it’s a godsend: the Mate 20 Pro can wirelessly charge other Qi-charging phones or devices. There’s nothing more heroic than lending a hapless friend some juice when their phone is at death’s door.DesignLooking at the Mate 20 Pro tells you two things: 1) it likely costs quite a bit of money, and 2) it’s got a signature look – but only from the back. Which isn’t to knock its high-resolution, curved-edge screen and thin-but-wide notch; we’ve just seen them elsewhere before. The top tier of the smartphone market requires differentiation, and Huawei chose to let its cameras do the talking. The Mate 20 Pro collects all three of its rear-facing cameras and its flash in a slightly-raised block on the phone’s backside. With the rear fingerprint sensor gone, this gives the phone a clean, semi-symmetrical look that’s better in person than in pictures.Individuality aside, there’s no getting over how long and thin this phone is. The Mate 20 Pro dimensions are still several millimeters smaller than beastly flagship phones like the Samsung Galaxy Note 9, but it is one of the larger phones on the market. As a result, using the Mate 20 Pro one-handed went out the door during our testing. We found ourselves relying on the serviceable facial recognition rather than the in-screen fingerprint sensor (located 2/3 down the front) to unlock the phone. The thinner edges made it difficult to type or swipe around one-handed, and the sleek front-and-back surfaces combined with the very tall ratio (19.5:9) made it a bit hard to use the phone casually, like if I wanted to flip it out to check the weather.In other words, it feels like a pricey phone that sacrificed ease-of-use for a little extra screen space, which is great for whoever is fine with two-handing their device. To be fair, there are a couple settings to help, but the most useful just shrinks the screen space to put it within reach of your fingers, wasting a good portion of that big, beautiful display.The phone itself comes in five colors, three of which have the standard glossy surface that makes it trivial to slide the phone over slick tables (the slightly-protruding camera block notwithstanding). These include a standard Black, a cream-colored Pink Gold and the signature Huawei blue-fading-to-purple Twilight.The last two hues, Emerald Green and Midnight Blue, have something else: an ever-so-slightly textured back. Remember holofoil trading cards and comics from your childhood? That’s what this feels like, arguably affording more grip than the other surfaces and, as Huawei claims, resisting fingerprint smudging. But it’s so subtle that it might just be there to sound cool when you run your finger across it. (As “cool” as a muted zipper sounds, anyway.) In other words, it’s one of many small things that contribute to the Mate 20 Pro’s rep as a pricey, elite phone.The other instant giveaway, of course, are the three rear cameras, arranged in a signature 2x2 grid. A Huawei spokesperson reckoned that the camera block would instantly tip bystanders off to your phone’s make and model, and they aren’t wrong.The Mate 20 Pro has a full IP68 water and dust resistance rating, which is the industry standard these days. And lastly, if you lamented when the Mate 10 ditched the headphone jack, hopefully you bought some Bluetooth headphones in the interim: the Mate 20 Pro doesn’t have a 3.5mm port, either. If that’s a dealbreaker, consider the vanilla Mate 20 or the gamer-focused Mate 20 X – both of which include the standard audio port.ScreenMate 20 Pro’s OLED 6.39-inch screen is gorgeous, plain and simple. It helps that the Mate 20 Pro ditched the Mate 10’s bottom-front button for a seamless display. Its bezels are pretty thin, especially without a lower speaker grille: instead, sound comes out of the bottom-facing USB-C port. (Don’t worry, its output isn’t dampened much when something is plugged in.)The display has an impressive 19.5:9 ratio 2K+ resolution (3120x1440), which is about 537 pixels per inch. That puts it ahead of the Google Pixel 3 at 439ppi and just past the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 at around 514ppi. While there’s not too much content that makes full use of this resolution – and, sadly, there’s no out-of-the-box option to split the screen between two windows –  it’s still a sharp and vibrant display.If you want to shift the color temperature or ditch all the harsh blue light, there are options in the settings to tweak those to your preference. If you want, you can even downgrade the Mate 20 Pro resolution to full HD or lower, which reduces battery drain, though that feels like a Harrison Bergeron-level injustice. Even dialed down to HD+, the expansive screen looks good.The Mate 20 Pro display’s edges curve down in a this-looks-expensive style straight out of Samsung’s playbook. Even if it doesn’t come with any interactive elements (like the squeeze-to-activate HTC U11 Edge Sense), the curved screen admittedly gives the Pro a classy, if unoriginal, look. Speaking of following trends – yes, the Mate 20 Pro has a notch. It’s about as wide as the iPhone XS for the same reason: to fit in the front-facing camera and sensor package. If you find the notch hideous, you can hide it with an effect that shifts the ‘ears’ into dark mode, which decently simulates a full black bar at the top. It’s a good bet that the OLED screen is brighter than the 820 nits its less-powered sibling, the Mate 20, is capable of, but we don’t have an official word from Huawei. Suffice to say, it can get bright. Very bright. The in-screen fingerprint sensor does work, and pretty reliably... so long as your finger is placed in the small target area. A fingerprint zone pops up when the screen activates, which means you’ll either have to tap the display ‘awake’ to find your target or guess where the sensor is. That’s much harder to do by feel when grabbing your phone from a pocket.Even then, it’s not perfect at recognizing fingerprints, and is so-so at reading portions of fingers. While the in-screen sensor certainly makes the Mate 20 Pro easier to unlock than a back-mounted sensor or facial recognition when it’s resting flat, the feature is more cumbersome than a dedicated physical button.Still, Huawei is ushering in the age of in-screen fingerprints, which deserves praise for keeping the front screen lean and clean."

While we never saw the mighty Mate-series here in India, we did see some P-series phones releasing in the country until Huawei P9 in 2016. Here we are not taking into account the Nova 2i as it was launched in India under its sub-brand, Honor 9i.Skipping the year 2017, Huawei re-entered the Indian smartphone market with its innovative flagship smartphones - P20 Pro and its little sibling P20 Lite. The former ensured a warm comeback with its innovative tri-camera technology and stunning design. Followed by the flagship, Huawei later released the Nova 3 (the OnePlus 6 competitor) with the Nova 3i priced lower at Rs 20,990.The Nova 3i and the P20 Lite are priced similarly, and they compete against some serious competition from Xiaomi in the form of Xiaomi's Mi A2, and it's own gaming-centric cousin Honor Play.Out of the three, does the Nova 3i stand a chance over them to be the best phone in its range? Find out in the review.Huawei Nova 3i price and availabilityThe first flash sale for the Huawei Nova 3i commenced on August 7. The Huawei Nova 3i’s Iris purple edition will be available via flash sale model on August 21, 2018. HDFC card members can avail an instant discount of 5% on their purchase and the smartphone is available at a no-cost EMI option of up to 9 months.Design and buildHas an iPhone like NotchDelicate yet appealing glass and metal designSince it's a toned down version of the Nova 3, the design is more or less kept similar. It simply means that the Nova 3i  has a design that's constant on a Rs 34,999 phone too. So, it has a fine-looking metal and glass sandwich design that sure looks much better than most of the competition. Not to forget that design has always been amongst the top focus areas for Huawei, the recently launched Honor 9N is a good example of it. The Huawei Nova 3i walks a similar road. From the back, the Nova 3i looks strikingly similar to the Huawei P20 Lite (especially the black variant). The P20 Lite has a relatively small chin, minimal side bezels, and a notch cut-out at the top of the display containing the front camera and earpiece. So, the dimensions and weight differ on both. The Nova 3i is slightly broader, a bit taller and has a certain amount of heft which adds to the sturdiness. The Huawei Nova 3i has an extremely reflective glass back There are always three major downsides to smartphones with heavy usage of glass on the body -  risk to use sans cover, the slippery nature of the glass and its affinity to attract fingerprints. Slapping a case on the phone does hurt the look and feel, but that's what we will recommend.Well, it's not new, but Apple's continued influence on modern smartphone design can be easily spotted on the front of the Nova 3i. The footprint and shape are quite identical, and of course, there's the familiar notch stacked at the top edge of the immersive display.Although the notch does not have the iPhone X-like high tech camera array under the notch, it's still quite broad because of the dual camera setup. Although the  82.03% of screen-to-body ratio seems almost bezel-less, that doesn't mean Huawei has used the extra space very smartly. There's a noticeable chin at the bottom, but it's also among the thinnest on phones of this range right now. The fingerprint sensor sits on the back in a more regular position seen on most Android phones. It's quite easy to access with one hand.The Huawei Nova 3i weighs in at 169g. With dimensions set at 157.6 x 75.2 x 7.6mm, it really is pocketable and can be used with one hand.Face unlock and fingerprint sensorThe Face Unlock on the Nova 3i isn't as advanced and secure as the one on the iPhone X, but it sure is a better implementation than many other Face ID wannabes. It's quick and accurate, even when I tried it in minimal light or even pitch dark.It does take a full second to unlock but that's when the phone is locked. Huawei went a step ahead and added raise to unlock feature that works impressively well. By turning it on, users just need to raise the phone in front of the face and boom! you're inside the phone.However, in comparison, it's not as fast as the one on OnePlus 6 but it's equally accurate. I personally relied on the fingerprint unlock, which was more convenient and faster. But still, good work there by Huawei, but it's the animation that takes an extra count to open the home screen.The Face unlock is turned off by default, so you need to surf around the security settings to set it up. It is surprisingly fast and takes no time to enroll your face, which further ensures that it isn’t truly obtaining a detailed 3D map of your face like Face ID.But again, when it comes to daily use and better security, you might want to stick with the default fingerprint sensor. The sensor on this phone is super-quick and easy to reach.It has a tall and bright 6.3-inch display DisplayEdge-to-edge 5.84-inch display1080 x 2280 resolutionWithout being too big for one-handed operation, the Huawei Nova 3i manages to cram in a 6.3-inch 2340x1080p IPS LCD display, credits to the whole edge-to-edge approach. The notch makes it an unusual or rather unorthodox 19:9 aspect ratio.The huge display looks impressive from the moment it turns on. It makes for a perfect canvas when flicking through the home screen and native apps. However, except for some native apps, many apps remain unoptimized for this aspect ratio. Still, the panel is capable and looks quite attractive with that design. It's sharp, accurate, but of course, it doesn't have a high contrast ratio and saturation of an AMOLED panel. An AMOLED panel also does a better job at hiding the notch with deep black bands on both sides of the notch. While in this case, the black isn't merging into the black notch that well. The Nova 3i follows suit with most phones in its range having 1080 x 2280 screen, which not just makes it sharp, but also fairs well when used for multimedia."
5,2,3Vdv5tdSAPUXTejA2DySQP,3Vdv5tdSAPUXTejA2DySQP,iPhone XR review,,na,na,na,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xr-review,,"Update: The iPhone XR has been updated to iOS 12.1.3, adding new emoji and features in the process.Apple has managed a marketing masterstroke with the iPhone XR: not only has it delayed the launch of the third of its trio of 2018 iPhones, thus creating some mystery around it, it’s also managed to make this seem like 2018's ‘cheap’ iPhone.Yes, it’s cheaper compared to the recently-launched iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max, but we’re talking $749 (£749 / AU$1229) compared with $999 (£999 / AU$1,629), which is hardly budget. To the average price-conscious, brand-neutral buyer this is a long way from a ‘cheap iPhone’. To the Apple fan who wants to stick with the brand though, the iPhone XR offers a much cheaper way to get a 2018 model without having to pay the sky-high prices of the XS duo, without sacrificing too much in terms of features – and with a cheeky amount more performance than one might expect.While it’s impossible to know for certain what Apple is aiming to achieve with the later launch of the iPhone XR, the fact remains that it’s already enjoyed the buzz of the new iPhone XS launch, and now has a second bite of the, er, apple in terms of generating hyper around this ‘mystery’ phone. Well, Apple has either pulled a marketing masterstroke or screwed itself by missing sales from launching late – as the XR is one of the best iPhones we’ve ever tested.iPhone XR price and release dateThe price of the iPhone XR is something that’s going to attract buyers: at $749 / £749 / AU$1229 for the 64GB model ($799 / £799 / AU$1299 for 128GB and $899 / £899 / AU$1479 for the 256GB) it’s far more affordable than the iPhone XS.You can now buy the phone around the world as it was released on October 26 2018, and it's on sale in Apple Stores and at your local phone emporium, with few concerns about stock levels. The cheapest UK contract prices can be found on our best iPhone XR deals guide.What's new?Compared to the iPhone XS, the iPhone XR is downgraded in a number of ways to hit that lower price point. That said, there are a number of key features that are the same: iOS 12 is the operating system that runs things, and it’s backed up by the wildly-powerful A12 Bionic chipset inside.The notch contains all the same front-facing cameras and sensors as the iPhone XS, and the dual speakers still face the same way when pumping out sound. iPhone XR specsWeight: 194gDimensions: 150.9 x 75.7 x 8.3mmOS: iOS 12Screen size: 6.1-inch Resolution: 1792 x 828CPU: A12 BionicStorage: 64/128/256Rear camera: 12MPFront camera: 7MPColors: Blue, White, Black, Yellow, Coral, RedResistance: IP67To the untrained eye, or someone not holding the iPhone XR and XS side by side, it might even be hard to instantly tell the two apart – but there are a number of key differences that we need to dig into.Only a single cameraArguably the most impressive thing about the iPhone XS is the camera, as it’s the only thing that feels significantly upgraded over the iPhone X. While the iPhone XR offers the same ‘standard’ lens as the XS, it lacks the telephoto second sensor, so has to do some fancy tricks with software to compensate.This means you won’t be able to zoom in as far with the XR, as the telephoto lens offers (relatively) lossless photography at two times zoom, while portrait mode, where the background is blurred out, isn’t as effective.You can still take a portrait shot and have the background attractively blurred to keep the focus on the subject, but unlike with the iPhone XS, you can’t take pictures of objects and animals in the same way.This is due to the fact the software can’t identify those subjects as easily from the single sensor, where the additional hardware on the more expensive XS is able to draw on more info.The Liquid Retina screenApple is never one to shy away from some marketing hyperbole, and the iPhone XR comes with a ‘new’ type of LCD, a screen that’s been designed to allow it to make this curved, ‘all-screen’ display.The effect is much like the LCD screens Apple has made before, to be honest, as they’ve always been colorful and sharp, but with the new ‘Liquid Retina’ display things are supposed to closer to the high-end OLED screen.We’ll delve more into the quality of the screen later in this review, but it’s one of the key differences you’ll want to consider if you’re thinking about going for the less-costly iPhone.No 3D TouchThere’s one way to know if you use a feature on an iPhone, and that’s to take it away, and see if you miss it. Anyone coming from a later-series Apple handset will have had access to 3D Touch, where pressing the screen harder opens menus or activates different features in apps.This feature has been removed for the iPhone XR, presumably to save money – instead you have to do a ‘long press’ to do the same thing. So if you ever accessed shortcuts by pushing harder on an app, or opened the torch with a harder prod on the lock screen… well, that’s gone.We didn’t realise how much we used that feature before – and it’s irritating to not have something that feels like a real button to open the camera – but it doesn’t take long to get used to the alternative… it just feels a bit less premium.Chunkier designThe iPhone XR is also a thicker design, with chunkier bezels around the side of the phone – hold it side by side with an iPhone XS and you’ll feel it’s clearly the cheaper model, with a thicker feel in the hand.However, looking at it and handling it in isolation you’ll just feel that it’s a smooth, rounded design that apes the popular form of the iPhone 7 or iPhone 8 – basically, the iPhone XR is the all-screen version of those handsets, bringing a screen the size of those on the  iPhone 7 Plus or 8 Plus in a form factor that’s more akin to the smaller models.Multiple colorsImage 1 of 6Image 2 of 6Image 3 of 6Image 4 of 6Image 5 of 6Image 6 of 6The notion that this is the new iPhone 5C is one that could be easily argued, as this is the first iPhone in a long time to come in so many colors: (product) RED, which is the sample we have, blue, white, yellow, coral and black.It's a nice look, although it would be nice to have some more flashes of color on the front of the phone too. If you're thinking of buying an iPhone from a fashion point of view, this could well be the way to do it, with the colors chosen impressing when we checked them all out at the launch event.Improved batteryApple believes you’ll be able to get 90 minutes more battery life out of the iPhone XR than the 8 Plus, which is a big jump in real terms.Well – and we don’t want to spoil the surprise a little later – we’d say it’s even better: the iPhone XR finally achieves the holy grail of all-day battery life in an iPhone.Perhaps that’s giving Apple a little too much credit – after all, there are plenty of Android phones out there that can utterly smoke the iPhone range for power longevity, giving you far longer between charges.Apple has offered terrible battery life for years, incrementally improving it to be ‘just good enough’, and the iPhone XR is the first iPhone we haven’t had a real worry about day to day – and that alone could elevate it to the heights of being the greatest iPhone ever created."
6,2,jKF3T99oFQjfQKBxnxihU5,jKF3T99oFQjfQKBxnxihU5,iPhone XS Max review,,na,na,na,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xs-max-review,,"The iPhone XS Max (pronounced ‘Ten S Max’) is the biggest smartphone Apple has ever made. With a 6.5-inch display, hardly any screen bezel and the now-iconic screen notch it’s a dominating presence in the hand.It also dominates the pocket, both in terms of size and price. As well as being the biggest, the iPhone XS Max is also the most expensive iPhone to date, with Apple delivering a handset with a screen size that rivals the most premium of Android flagships.Update: the iPhone XS Max has now been updated to iOS 12.1.4 but some other rivals have also arrived, so we've updated this review accordingly.This is a bold statement from a firm that has, up until 2017 with the introduction of the 5.8-inch iPhone X, resisted the urge to push the screen size envelope to the same scale as its Android rivals.However, Apple has decided that now is the right time to supersize its smartphone display and the iPhone XS Max is the first generation of the new, larger form factor.For those who crave more screen for video and gaming on the move, the expansive display of the iPhone XS Max will be a welcome addition to Apple’s lineup, while those wanting a premium experience without the supersized dimensions can take comfort that it’s launched alongside the smaller iPhone XS.Read our in-depth iPhone XS reviewRead our in-depth iPhone XR reviewRead our in-depth Apple Watch 4 reviewWatch our 48-hour review of the iPhone XS and iPhone XS Max video belowiPhone XS Max price and availabilityiPhone XS Max 64GB price: $1,099 (£1,099, AU$1,799)iPhone XS Max 256GB price: $1,249 (£1,249, AU$2,049)iPhone XS Max 512GB price: $1,449 (£1,449, AU$2,369)As we've already hinted, this is a premium phone with an even more premium price tag. The iPhone XS Max starts at $1,099 (£1,099, AU$1,799) for the 64GB model, which is $100 (£100, AU$170) more than the iPhone XS. In the UK, our guide will help you find the best iPhone XS Max deals on contract. If you want more internal storage, the 256GB iPhone XS Max price is $1,249 (£1,249, AU$2,049), while the most expensive 512GB version will set you back a staggering $1,449 (£1,449, AU$2,369).There's no mainstream smartphone that costs more than the 512GB iPhone XS Max, putting it in a league of its own in terms of pricing. You do get a lot of phone for the money – but there's no getting away from the fact that it's an awful lot of money that Apple is asking for.DesignSame design as iPhone X, but biggerA touch shorter and narrow than the iPhone 8 Plus, with a bigger screenThe iPhone XS Max design is deceptive. Pick it up, and the rounded sides of the handset make it feel noticeably thick.The result is a phone that doesn't sit as comfortably in the hand as it could, and considering the size and cost of the XS Max it's a phone you want to be able to securely hold. This is only half the story though.We compared the iPhone XS Max to a number of phones during our in-depth review, including the Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (6.4-inch screen), OnePlus 6T (6.41-inch) and Sony Xperia XZ3 (6-inch), and the iPhone felt thicker, and less planted in the hand than all of them. The funny thing is though, the iPhone XS Max is thinner than all of those phones at just 7.7mm.The reason for this is simple: tapered edges. The Samsung, Sony and OnePlus all taper their rear edges, giving the impression of a thinner device while also allowing them to sit a little better in the curvature of your hand.The iPhone XS Max has a totally flat back that's a little more awkward to hold, and we found that a tactfully-placed pinkie finger on the underside of the phone was a must for one-handed use.iPhone XS Max hands-on galleryImage 1 of 11Image 2 of 11Image 3 of 11Image 4 of 11Image 5 of 11Image 6 of 11Image 7 of 11Image 8 of 11Image 9 of 11Image 10 of 11Image 11 of 11What's more impressive is that the XS Max manages to squeeze a huge 6.5-inch display into a body that's a touch shorter and narrower (at 157.5 x 77.4mm) than the iPhone 8 Plus, which only boasts a 5.5-inch display.While the iPhone XS Max does feel a little chunky in the hand there's no questioning the fact that you're getting a huge amount of display real estate crammed into a form factor which does a good job of keeping it usable.The steel frame around the outside and the new formulation of glass on the front and rear – which is tougher than the glass on the iPhone X – give the iPhone XS Max a supremely premium look and feel, while its resistance to dust and water has also been enhanced.Apple has upped the protection to IP68, enabling the iPhone XS Max to be submerged to a depth of up to two meters for 30 minutes without suffering any ill effects. Apple claims it's tested the protection in a number of liquids, including salt water, chlorinated water, milk, wine and beer, although we wouldn't advise purposefully exposing the handset to any of these.It's worth noting that Apple's warranty, like those of all phone manufacturers, doesn't cover 'liquid contact' damage, which means if the liquid resistance does fail on the iPhone XS Max you won't be covered.The headphone jack is gone for good from iPhonesThere's no headphone jack on the iPhone XS Max. The port is now totally dead after Apple killed off the iPhone 6S and iPhone SE post-iPhone XS launch (the last two handsets with the 3.5mm jack that were available from the firm's site), which means you get a centralized Lightning port alongside speaker and microphone holes on the base of the iPhone XS Max.There's a pair of Apple EarPods with a lightning connector in the box with the iPhone XS Max, but if you plug this into the lightning port on the base of the phone you can't connect the charging cable to it at the same time.Thankfully, the iPhone XS Max also supports wireless charging, so if you have a charging pad to hand you can top the handset up while listening to a wired set of headphones.The power/lock key is on the right side of the XS Max, and is easy enough to hit with thumb or forefinger, while the volume keys sit below the physical mute switch on the left of the handset.Hold the power/lock key down and you'll bring up Siri, which means turning off the iPhone XS Max requires you to hold down the power and volume up keys until an on-screen prompt appears.The SIM card tray continues to be located below this key, but there's a new feature inside the iPhone XS Max (and XS). The handset is dual SIM enabled, with an eSIM embedded inside the handset.This allows you to insert a SIM from the carrier of your choice, and then enable the eSIM on a different plan or carrier. It's worth noting that not all carriers support eSIM technology, and availability varies by region, so make sure you check before signing up to anything.Overall though, Apple hasn't moved far from the design of the iPhone X with the iPhone XS Max, other than to stretch it a little. There is, however, a new color option over the X.Apple introduced a new gold finish for both the iPhone XS Max and XS, and it's a little richer than the more subtle gold finish option for the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus. If you find the gold a bit too much, the iPhone XS Max also comes in Silver and Space Gray."
7,2,Bz9FmsBRJ46UgFadNzrmyE,Bz9FmsBRJ46UgFadNzrmyE,iPhone XS review,,na,na,na,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/iphone-xs-review,,"This is the iPhone XS – pronounced ‘10-S’, not ‘excess’ as you might think. It looks identical to last year's iPhone X, and you might think that not a lot has changed – but it’s inside where the differences lie.This is a weird situation for a review; usually, when looking at an ‘S’ variant of an iPhone we’re asking the question of whether it’s better than the now-cheaper model from the previous year.In 2018, however, Apple has made the choice to discontinue the iPhone X, so while we can draw comparisons they won’t help you make an informed choice (unless you can still pick one up while stocks last).Update: we've added a competition section to this review, highlighting the iPhone XS's key rivals. Plus, iOS 12.1.3 has landed on the phone and some stores are offering it at a reduced price, all of which we've detailed in the review.If you want the best iPhone Apple has created, the iPhone XS is surely it – but do the tweaks inside really justify the price tag, and are they enough to fend off the ever-improving competition?There’s also the looming specter of the iPhone XR – it’s a more affordable version in many ways compared to the iPhone XS, but until we can test that in the future (it’s due out in October) it’s hard for us to say whether the iPhone XS is the best Apple handset for you.Read our in-depth iPhone XS Max reviewRead our hands-on iPhone XR reviewRead our hands-on Apple Watch 4 reviewiPhone XS price and release dateStarts at $999 / £999 / AU$1,629Top model costs $1,349 / £1,349 / AU$2,199In terms of the price, the good (ish) news is that it hasn't risen over last year’s incredibly expensive iPhone X, with the 64GB iPhone XS price coming in at $999 / £999 / AU$1,629. The 256GB iPhone XS price is $1,149 / £1,149 / AU$1,879, and the 512GB iPhone XS price is $1,349 / £1,349 / AU$2,199.That said, while the cost of rival smartphones has been going up, the iPhone XS is still going to be one of the most costly phones you can buy (apart from the iPhone XS Max, which carries the eye-watering price tag of $1,099 / £1,099 / AU$1,799 for the cheapest option).You may be able to find the phones a little cheaper from other stores though. For example, at the time of writing both Amazon and Carphone Warehouse in the UK are offering a 256GB iPhone XS for the price of a 64GB one.In the UK, our guide will help you find the best iPhone XS deals on contract.Key featuresNew gold color optionSame design and similar features as last genUsually in this section we'd talk about all the new features that the phone brings – but in this case there really aren't that many, with Apple resolutely sticking to the strategy of launching an 'S' phone with little changed other than speed improvements and a few other performance bumps.That's not to say it isn't impressive, and useful, new hardware in the iPhone XS, but most of the benefits won't be instantly discernible to the average user.One change that is easy to spot is the new color: the gold variant is more mocha than anything else, with a touch of copper in the shade, and brings another option in addition to the Space Gray and silver options.We can only surmise that this was possible because the chassis of the iPhone XS is so similar to that of the iPhone X, so it wasn't expensive or time-consuming to alter the process to add in a new hue.A12 Bionic chipsetThe iPhone XS and XS Max both have the same chipset insideLoads of powerNeural Engine brings enhancements throughoutNotably more powerful AR capabilitiesApple is proudly talking up its new chipset, and with good reason: it's one of the most powerful on a smartphone, created as it was using a 7nm process. That may not mean much to most people, but essentially it means that more transistors can be chucked onto this hexa-core CPU, which has two 'power' cores and four more that are optimized for efficiency.However, even those slower cores are still more powerful than any of those found in the iPhone 6, a handset that's only four years old, showing just how rapidly smartphone technology is progressing in terms of power and efficiency.One might question whether this much power is really needed – and sure, if you're just browsing the web and sending messages it's utterly wasted. However, if you want to explore the world of augmented reality, then these extra transistors are on hand to help out.There's also a new 'Neural Engine' in the mix, enabling your phone to become more intelligent, learning as you use it. It adds a 'smart layer' to proceedings, allowing the handset to recognize things on the screen, whether that's appending an Animoji to your head in real time during a FaceTime call, or working out what's needed to improve the quality of a photo as you're taking it.It's hard to really quantify the benefit of this improved chipset other than through numbers. Running the iPhone XS through the Geekbench CPU testing process showed that it's the most powerful phones we've ever used: a score of 11,481 is over 1,000 higher than the iPhone X from last year, and better than any phone we've tested.That speed improvement is easy to feel within the phone, as the iPhone XS is one of the snappiest handsets we've ever tapped our way through. It's tricky to say how much of this is down to the hardware and how much to the improved iOS 12 software – but either way, it's a really, really rapid experience.The A12 chipset brings a step up in graphical performance too – gaming is getting ever closer to console-level graphics, and we had the chance to check out a few AR titles too.That said, we're still not fully convinced about the benefits of AR gaming – it's mildly diverting for a while, but many titles still seem to lack the overall polish that more typical iPhone games bring, such as Elder Scrolls: Blades, where you've got incredible gaming prowess mixed with high-level effects within.For instance, we played ElemenTao, and not only did it lack any kind of tutorial but it was a bit clunky when we tried to play it on a desk. That's not really the fault of the game, but rarely do we have a large table with nothing on it on which we can play solo titles, or with chums.Yes, there will be moments when it's cool, but they'll be as rare as deciding to play board games of an evening – so it depends if that’s what you’re into."

Here's our updated review.The LG G7 ThinQ touts a Super Bright LCD that's viewable in direct sunlight, which is ironic because the rest of it has a hard time standing out.It's a reasonable, but not significant upgrade over last year's LG G6, and with a larger 6.1-inch all-screen display, AI-enhanced cameras, a loud 'Boombox Speaker', a faster chipset, and Google's Android 8.0 Oreo software out of the box.It's also cheaper than the new LG V40, which has five cameras, slightly better specs and a larger 6.4-inch OLED screen. It's a monster phone with a monster pricetag.You may not immediately be wowed by any of the LG G7 specs in comparison. It doesn't have a curved OLED screen like the Samsung Galaxy S9, the triple-lens rear camera of the Huawei P20 Pro, or the undeniable value of the OnePlus 6. And despite its controversial notch cutout at the top, it doesn't have Apple's fancy 3D TrueDepth camera, as seen on the iPhone X.LG is emphasizing that this is a smart, not flashy, phone. As the 'ThinQ' part of the name suggests, the company is determined to push AI onto all of its smart devices no matter how awkward the moniker sounds. The execution on this new ThinQ phone is, thankfully, a little more practical than the nomenclature.Watch our hands-on LG G7 ThinQ video below to see the phone in actionThere's a dedicated AI button on the left side of the phone, and LG isn't forcing its own virtual assistant homebrew into your daily life like Samsung does with Bixby. No, this button leads to the familiar Google Assistant, and uses far-field voice recognition to better understand commands. In short, it's better than the Bixby button.Its dual-lens AI camera emphasizes ThinQ, too, with its ability to categorize subjects and automatically tune its settings to snap better photos via machine learning. It can also recognize low-light situations, and employ Super Bright Mode to make photos and video four times as bright as on the G6, albeit – at a reduced resolution.The LG ThinQ a more normal-looking, risk adverse phone from LG. It's pleasing, but not at all surprising.We tested LG G7 for several weeks, and noticed an uptick in photo quality next to the G6, just like we saw on the LG V30S ThinQ, the first LG phone with its AI camera and Bright Mode. It's not better than the Google Pixel 2, Google Pixel 2 XL, or Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus – most due to LG's smaller camera sensor size – but it's still a step up for LG, and this is one of the only phones with a wide-angle camera. The wide-angle rear camera was able to capture more of what we saw in front of us, and LG’s robust cinematic video tools make it easier to record 4K video with a lot of style. On the front of the G7, LG finally upgraded its front-facing camera to 8MP. That's where we see the biggest improvement among the cameras, if only because LG has been holding back with a 5MP on previous handsets.Google Lens appears with two taps of the new AI buttonMachine learning is just one way to aid in capturing superior photos, but like the megapixel count, what matters more are how the pictures look after everything is processed. We have a full gallery of photos later in the review.The LG G7 wins on completeness, even if it doesn't have many standout features. It doesn't take big chances on design or battery life, but it looks stylish in most colors and lasts long enough with all-day longevity. It's biggest weakness is the price, specifically in the US, next to its competitors that are do things a little bit better in almost every department. Depending on where you live, it's either a good deal for a phone without much pizzazz (like in the UK), or overpriced and will have you counting down the days to the inevitable LG V40 (like in the US). LG G7 is this year's smartphone sleeper hit no matter where you live.Price and release dateRelease date: May/June 2018US LG G7 price: $749UK LG G7 price: £599AU LG G7 price: AU$ $1,099The LG G7 ThinQ was announced on May 2, 2018 and its available in the UK, US, Australia and a number of other markets around the worldIn the US, the LG G7 is available from all carriers apart from AT&T, which instead has opted to exclusivly stock the LG V35 instead.We're still waiting for the official price and release date information.The LG G7 price is more expensive than we had hoped: $749 in the US through Verizon and T-Mobile, with the latter selling the Raspberry Rose color exclusively. Verizon, meanwhile, is slashing the price by $100 if you buy it on a device payment plan ($31.25 a month for 24 months) – essentially making it $650, and 100% more confusing. Let's go 110% more confusing and cite that Sprint will have it for even more: $792. Ouch.It's £599 SIM free in the UK, making it significantly cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy S9 launch price in the UK, even though the LG G7 is more expensive than the S9 in the US.It's AU$1,099 in Australia at stores JB Hi-Fi and Mobileciti, that's cheaper than the S9.Where you are in the world really determines whether or not the G7 is a good value.Super Bright LCD and glass design6.1-inch Super Bright LCD display makes it easier to see your phone screen outdoorsNotch design makes way for status icon-filled ‘New Second Screen’ Sleep/wake button moved to the side, fingerprint sensor remains on backGlass back, 3.5mm headphone and IP68 water-resistance The LG G7's design puts an emphasis on its 6.1-inch LCD screen, which takes up nearly the entire front of the device, save for a notch at the top and a small chin bezel at the bottom. Its clean-looking unibody glass and all-screen aesthetic are a big upgrade over the fractured metal LG G5 look two years ago, even if this means you have to forgo a replaceable battery.The notch left and right sides can be hidden in black or accentuated with various colors and gradients. Either way, it's extra screen space for status icons, the time and the battery life percentage.LG calls the top screen space to the left and right of the notch its ‘New Second Screen’ – it’s not. At least not like it was on the LG V10 and LG V20 second screen which showed detailed notifications. This is simply where the time, battery life percentage, and small notification icons live.The notch is also LG’s way of expanding the screen to a 19.5:9 aspect ratio – there’s a smidgen more space to fit all of those status icons. And, hey, if you don’t like the controversial notch look, you can always ‘hide' it by masking the screen corners. Or, if you really want to highlight this Apple-esque design trait, you can change up the color and even add gradients (the middle notch will always be black, though). You can see the blacked-out LCD sides surrounding the notch, but only with a discriminating eye in certain light. However, after several months of using the LG G7 we grew to accept the notch, and we now hardly notice it.The LCD also carriers an always-on display, despite the fact that this is more of an OLED-benefiting technology.Why LCD? LG likes to boast that its entire display can get very bright – maxing out at 1,000 nits. This makes it ideal for outdoor use when a normal smartphone peaks at 500 or maybe 600 nits. LG calls this its Super Bright Display, and says it's 30% more energy efficient in this mode versus the LG G6 screen.Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus (top) vs LG G7 ThinQ (bottom) in direct sunlight. The G7, in this test, looked brighter.The Super Bright Display mode lasts for three minutes, a cap meant to save your battery and not overheat the device. That was just enough time to read messages our phone screen while walking outdoors in direct sunlight in our preliminary testing. The problem is that the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus we were carrying also showed a peak brightness of more than 1,000 nits. It’s one of the few phones that can do this besides the G7, but it’s also LG’s chief smartphone rival. It some cases, the G7 looked brighter without distorting the images on-screen, but not always.The LG G7 ThinQ has an easy-to-reach fingerprint sensor on back, just below a vertically stacked dual-lens rear camera. Only this sensor pad doesn’t click in to double as a sleep/wake button, like on other recent LG devices. LG’s design team has returned the power to the right side of the phone – where it belongs – after much feedback. They've clearly gotten our letters.Remember when LG used to put both the sleep/wake button and volume buttons on the back of its phones, circa LG G4? Yes, it provided cleaner sides, and it was easier to grasp the device without accidentally pressing these buttons, but the design always felt too unconventional. The LG G7 feels like a mainstream, immediately familiar smartphone, and that’s pleasing.The sleep/wake button returns to the right side of the phone. The fingerprint sensor remains on the back, but doesn't click in.There is one extra button, too: the new dedicated AI button that sits on left side of the metal frame. More than a few times, we mispressed this Google Assistant shortcut, mistaking it for the volume down key on the left side. It’s the same problem we have with Samsung’s Bixby button. Luckily, you can turn off LG’s AI button, and the company is contemplating letting users remap it to another action in the future. LG could have avoided this issue though by adding a textured finish to the AI button, making it easier to recognize under thumb.LG’s AI button is better than Samsung’s, however. A single press launches Google Assistant, a double press launches you straight into Google Lens, and a long press on the key takes you straight into voice commands with Assistant. It’s a far more intuitive system than Samsung’s, and one we can see ourselves using.The LG G7 comes in a bunch of colors: Raspberry Rose, New Moroccan Blue, New Aurora Black, and New Platinum Gray. The LG G7 has a clean, albeit plainer look than the curved Samsung Galaxy S9 and Apple’s completely chin-less all-screen OLED. It feels premium in the hand, and at 162g is has a good weight without being too overbearing. Those with smaller palms will still likely find the LG G7 too big to use one-handed though.One thing to note though, the glass rear of the LG G7 is a real fingerprint magnet, so if you're not planning on putting a case on the phone be prepared to give it regular wipes.You can opt for a variety of colors to spice things up: Raspberry Rose, New Moroccan Blue, New Aurora Black, and New Platinum Gray. Not all LG G7 colors will be available in all countries. In the US, you'll find Raspberry Rose on T-Mobile. New Moroccan Blue is exclusive to the UK via O2."
9,2,RfTM75aj8rKyyb75dseonL,RfTM75aj8rKyyb75dseonL,Hands on: LG Q7 review,,na,na,na,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/lg-q7,,"LG gunning for the budget-friendly crowd has been fascinating to watch. It's an area that's fast being taken over by lesser knowns and up and comers in the smartphone space that offer up modest specs for a very reasonable price. Its latest attempt is the LG Q7, which was announced earlier in 2018, and is the successor to the - you've guessed it - the LG Q6. The Q6 was notable as it was the first budget handset to offer an 18:9 screen. Unfortunately, other features were annoyingly absent - including a rear fingerprint sensor. So, can the LG Q7 make amends and fill in some of the specs gaps that the Q6 failed to deliver? We tried it at IFA 2018 to find out.LG Q7 release date and priceThe LG Q7 has been announced for selected markets and should be released imminently. Its price is currently unknown but it is expected to come in at a similar price to the LG Q6 which retailed for quite a bit under $300 / £300 / $390 Aus when first released. Design and displayThe LG Q7 once again has an 18:9 screen; this one is 5.5 inches and is LG’s FullVision display variant, which offers 2160x1080 resolution, 442ppi. Don’t go expecting a non-bezeled display here - there is a bit of letter boxing on the top and the bottom of the device. It has a plasticky body with not too much chunk to it, at 143.8 x 69.3 x 8.4mm, and feels like it could be something of a smudge and scratch magnet. You’ll be pleased to read that the rear fingerprint scanner missing from the LG Q6 is all present and correct. There’s also a rear 13MP camera on the back, and some Q7 branding. On the left of the device is an SD/SIM slot (where you can add an additional 512GB of storage) and a volume rocker. On the right is the power button and at the bottom you have 3.5mm jack and USB-C charging. This is another upgrade to the LG Q6 which had to make do with plain-old micro-USB. Camera, power and batteryOn board, there’s 32GB of memory, 3GB of RAM and it makes use of a Mediatek MT6750S chip. If you wanted something with a bit more bite, then the Q7+ has been given the Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 chip - a chip we much prefer. The OS is Oreo 8.1 and to accompany the rear 13MP camera, there’s an 8MP selfie camera on the front. The front camera has a little bit of AI smarts, beautifying your face if you wish it too, when you take a selfie.Flicking through the various menus and screens and the LG Q7 felt pretty fluid. The overlay on top of Oreo was a little annoying, just a bit too childlike for our liking. But we got used to it the more we used the handset. We mentioned that the phone didn’t feel too chunky in the hand but it did feel a little too light. Couple this with a plasticky chassis and it makes everything feel, well, cheap. There are some enticing features, though. Fast charging is on board, so you should be able to juice up your phone to an appropriate level in around 30 minutes. The battery is a decent 3000mAh - it’s non removable, though, so you better hope it doesn’t degrade. For those looking for a bit of audio goodness, DTS: X Surround Sound on board. If it is DAC technology you are after - which can be found in the LG G7 Thinq range - the you will have to look elsewhere. Another big update to the Q6, however, is the introduction of waterproofing, with IP68-certification. To have this on a phone of this (mid)range is a bit of a bonus and should mean that you can run it under a tap and the tears won’t flow.Early VerdictIf you look at the LG Q7 against the LG G7 Thinq then the specs will disappoint - this is a mid-range phone after all. Pit it against its predecessor and there is quite a bit of change. Yes, it’s still got a plasticky, scratch-prone body but improvements have been made with a fingerprint sensor on the back, waterproofing and a better selfie camera. It’s not a radical change but does fix some of the issues we had with the LG Q6.IFA 2018 is Europe's biggest tech show. The TechRadar team is in Berlin to bring you all the breaking news and hands-on first impressions of new phones, watches and other tech as they're announced. Best budget smartphone 2018: our top cheap mobiles"

This is a chance to release some of the bottom-line squeeze of the G6, and perhaps look to emulate whatever alchemy makes the OnePlus 6 and the Honor 10 such mid-range champs.Sure enough, bolstered performance and an improved screen go some way to achieving that goal. The question is whether the margin of that improvement is sufficient to justify the existence of the Moto G6 Plus.It’s certainly remarkable how little we missed the flagship experience in moving to the Moto G6 Plus, but then the same thing could be said of the Moto G6. So are there enough additions to make the Plus worthy of the name?Moto G6 Plus price and availabilityAvailable to buy in the UK for £269 / AU$499 (about $380)No US releaseThe Moto G6 Plus completes a trio of budget-priced 2018 phones from Motorola alongside the Moto G6 and Moto G6 Play.If the name didn’t tell you that the Moto G6 Plus was the top performer in the range, then its £269 / AU$399 (about $380) price tag probably should. It’s £50 more expensive than the regular G6, and £100 dearer than the Moto G6 Play.While it’s available now in the UK, there are no plans to bring the Moto G6 Plus to the US at present, despite the ongoing availability of the Moto G5 Plus and Moto G5S Plus in the region.We don’t know if or when the Moto G6 Plus will be arriving in Australia as yet.Design and display5.9-inch display is bigger and brighter than G6Curved glass design much closer to Moto X4 than Moto G5Motorola has taken a very different approach to design with the Moto G6 Plus, at least compared to previous Moto G devices.Just like the Moto G6, out goes the somewhat nondescript combination of plastic and metal in favour of a sleeker amalgam of metal and glass. While the edges of the phone have a slightly cheap and plasticky feel to them, the curved rear panel is all-glass.You only need to look above the Moto G listing on the Motorola website to realise that this isn’t a completely fresh approach from the company. Last year’s Moto X4 looks and feels extremely similar.There are telltale signs that the Moto G6 Plus is a less-premium handset, however. Our test model seemed to have a slightly loose USB-C port on the bottom edge, causing the connector to wobble rather disconcertingly.Then there’s the cheap plastic SIM tray that had scratched to a much lighter color, evidently where some previous user had gone in a little too forcefully with a tray key.Another sign that this is isn’t a premium phone is the lack of proper water-proofing. Motorola claims that it’ll stand up to splashes with a 'water repellent nano-coating inside and out,' but there’s no IP rating to be found. The omission of such is much less of a criticism than it is in something like the OnePlus 6, but it’s still worth pointing out.One way in which the Moto G6 Plus design has evolved from the X4 is with the screen-to-body ratio. While this is far from a bezel-less display, the top and bottom edges of the phone have definitely receded in line with the 2018 trend.This can also be seen by looking at the size and shape of the fingerprint sensor below the display. The Moto G6 Plus's sensor is much flatter than the X4’s, though it’s recessed enough to be easy to find, and it remains fast and accurate.By expanding closer to the edges, Motorola has been able to keep the general size and feel of the Moto G6 Plus relatively modest, with dimensions of 160 x 75.5 x 8mm and a weight of 167g. It’s still a fair handful, and you won’t be using it comfortably with one hand, but it sits comfortably in the pocket, at least.This is despite the fact that the Moto G6 Plus has the largest display in the family - just. At 5.9-inches it’s only slightly bigger than the 5.7-inch G6 and G6 Play, and there’s an argument to be made that there should have been more of a difference here.Another way Motorola has kept its large-screen phone feeling slim, of course, is by making it longer and thinner. With an 18:9 aspect ratio, it joins the general trend for stretched-out smartphone displays.It means that a lot of video content you encounter will have side borders by default, particularly when it comes to YouTube. However, most fresh gaming content is being made to fit such screens, and properly mobile-optimised websites are definitely more pleasant to navigate on the longer display.As for the screen itself, we have absolutely no criticisms. Like the rest of the G6 family, you’re looking at an FHD+ (1080 x 2160) resolution, which you might think would be a problem given the sheer size of the display. While it’s less pixel-dense than the G6 - let alone QHD displays like the Samsung Galaxy S9 - it remains plenty sharp enough.It also seems to be better than the G6 display when it comes to maximum brightness and color contrast, which matters an awful lot more than a few inconsequential pixels."
11,2,8DgC4kZgBs2kTTEsRzyvfG,8DgC4kZgBs2kTTEsRzyvfG,Nokia 3.1 Plus review,,na,na,na,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nokia-31-plus,,"Nokia kicked off the year with their new range of smartphones that ended up being appreciated by many. Essentially, all the smartphones were a revision of their initial line-up, which we can confidently call as real upgrades.If we compare the first Nokia handsets after revival to new phones like the Nokia 5.1 Plus, Nokia 6.1 Plus or the Nokia 7 Plus, it's evident that the company has been paying attention to the feedback and is working towards fixing them.The latest one to join the league is the Nokia 3.1 Plus. It succeeds the Nokia 3.1 and is aimed at the budget market, especially in the offline market. Similar to its siblings, the Plus variant of the 3.1 shares minimal similarity with its predecessor. There's a lot of new stuff starting with the design to the internals, but is it good enough for the price or should you look away? Let's find out.Price and availabilityThe Nokia 3.1 Plus is priced at Rs. 11,499 and comes in three colors – White, Blue and Baltic. The Nokia 8110 4G is priced at Rs. 5,999. Both the smartphones will be available across retail channels from October 19. DesignThe Nokia 3.1 Plus shares its design language with its newly launched siblings--the Nokia 5.1 Plus and Nokia 6.1 Plus. The difference here is in the material used. While the other two phones sport a metal and glass body, the Nokia 3.1 Plus comes packed in an aluminum shell with poly-carbonate on the top and bottom (which aids better network reception). The metal on the back has a soft touch with a matte finish with zero reflection of shine. The finish on the rear panel resembles more like the Nokia 6.1 or the 5.1 and it feels sleek for sure. Not just the looks, but the in-hand feel of the phone is premium. Building upon Nokia's assurance of making solid phones, the sturdy built on the Nokia 3.1 Plus can be felt when you hold it in hand. The chrome lining around the camera and fingerprint sensor does add up to the overall appearance of the phone. It will, however, get stained easily.It has curved edges all around, which makes it easy to grip and hold for long without digging into the fingers/palm. But do remember, it's slightly heavier at 180g.  Although, the size of the phone does not qualify it to be called a handy device like the Nokia 6.1 Plus. There are two soft touch physical buttons on the right side--volume rocker and power/sleep key, and they are easily accessible and give a tactile feedback. The rear fingerprint scanner also falls nicely under the finger.The 3.5mm audio jack is on the top, while the micro USB port sits at the bottom with microphone and loudspeaker on its left and right respectively. There are two slots on the left side--one for a microSD card and the other for dual SIM cards. The front has a Nokia 7.1-like design, or say, a standard front frame with curved corners and an 18:9 display. A thick chin and forehead with an earpiece and front camera on top with the Nokia branding on the top right corner. Nokia is probably the only brand who has picked the odd spot for their logo on phones, others have either used the chin or haven't put the branding at all. With so many 18:9 display phones, it's never easy to know what phone it is.DisplayThe new Nokia 3.1 Plus has a new HD+ IPS LCD screen with an 18:9 aspect ratio, an expected update since the Nokia 3.1. It is a bit taller with a 6-inch panel where vertical resolution is still 720p and the horizontal is 1,440p like the Nokia 3.1.The black levels are deep, but the maximum brightness is just above average for outdoor viewing. Sunlight legibility is underwhelming, but still on par with competing devices.Color accuracy can't be counted in the strong areas of the display, it has a Cyan, Blue-Greenish tint to it. For regular users, it's a very average display for multimedia and gaming, but full HD resolution is a bare minimum that we expected.Battery life3500mAh batteryNokia claims 2-day battery backup We mentioned that the Nokia 3.1 Plus is slightly bulky, but that's because there's a juicy 3500mAh battery packed inside. Nokia promises 2-day battery on this phone, which is technically correct, but only if you don't stress your phone with power-intensive tasks and prolonged gaming. Power users can also get through a full 10 AM to 8 PM working day without a hitch. A full charge got us through a day's usage, which includes streaming, messaging, scrolling never-ending social media feed. It can be a dependable daily driver if the battery is your concern. CameraPrimary: 13MP PDAF/F2.0/1.12um Secondary: 5MP BW/FF/F2.4/1.12um 8MP front camera AI featuresThe Nokia 3.1 Plus sports a dual rear camera setup- 13-megapixel primary lens with f/2.0 aperture + 5.0-megapixel secondary lens with f/2.4 aperture. The front-facing camera is an 8-megapixel shooter with f/2.2 aperture. The camera setup is mediocre and by that we mean, it can take convincing shots in daylight, but struggles in trickier lighting situations. Against direct sunlight, we sometimes got overexposure and blown out highlights, and in low light, some areas seemed to smudge out. It struggles with auto-focus in restricted light and also, you need to keep your hand steady to get a clear shot. Nonetheless, if you give it a good lighting and a steady pair of hand, you can get shareable shot for your Instagram feed. The 8MP front camera takes good selfies, but again, it's not the best in low light environments. Image 1 of 26Image 2 of 26Image 3 of 26Image 4 of 26Image 5 of 26Image 6 of 26Image 7 of 26Image 8 of 26Image 9 of 26Image 10 of 26Image 11 of 26Image 12 of 26Image 13 of 26Image 14 of 26Image 15 of 26Image 16 of 26Image 17 of 26Image 18 of 26Image 19 of 26Image 20 of 26Image 21 of 26Image 22 of 26Image 23 of 26Image 24 of 26Image 25 of 26Image 26 of 26"

The following review has been updated to reflect this development.Since being rebooted under the watchful eye of HMD Global, the Nokia brand has been attached to some very solid, value-for-money handsets – think decent specs at a decent price, and a clean, stock version of Android to boot.With the Nokia 7.1, this rather appealing mid-range excellence is being pushed even further. But just how good can a phone at a mid-range price be? Actually rather good, the Nokia 7.1 whispers, with its attractive design, competent specs, and impressive camera.Not everyone wants to shell out four figures (or close to it) for a smartphone, of course, and these days you can get some rather capable phones for some rather appealing prices, with the Nokia 7.1 being one such handset.As for where this slots in to Nokia's increasingly complicated range, it's newer but cheaper than the Nokia 7 Plus. This is effectively Nokia's new champion mid-ranger, with only the Nokia 7 Plus and the Nokia 8 models (such as the Nokia 8 Sirocco) above it in terms of power and prestige.Nokia 7.1 price and release dateYours for a mere £299, US$349, AED 949On sale from November 2018You can buy the Nokia 7.1 unlocked for £299 in the UK, $349 in the US, AU$499 in Australia and AED 949 in the UAE, with shipping getting underway in early November.Even for a phone that's unashamedly mid-range, that's a low price – it's veering not far from budget territory. When you think that Apple's newest iPhone XS phones start the bidding at £999/$999, you're talking about a big price gap between the very top-end flagships of 2018 and what we have here with the Nokia 7.1.Your choice of colors depends on your market – midnight blue (like our review model) is available everywhere, with some regions (including the US, Australia and Middle East) stocking a gray silver option as well.Mid-range qualityYou get a lot for your moneyMiddling specs but superb packageWhat you really need to know about this phone is that it punches above its weight – it's weight being that price tag, the so-so Snapdragon 636 chipset inside, and the just-enough 3GB or 4GB of RAM. You get 32GB or 64GB of internal storage, though you can expand that with a memory card. These options vary by region.Where it goes beyond what you would expect from a mid-range phone is in the quality of its build, the quality of the display, and the quality of the camera. We're going to discuss all of these features in more detail in the review that follows, but they're the areas that the Nokia 7.1 stands out in.The HDR10 support on the display is worth noting, as it means superior contrast and a broader range of colors on the apps that support it (which include Netflix and Amazon Prime Video).On the camera side, a dual-lens rear camera is matched with a single-lens front-facing one, and the brand continues its #bothie push – that is, taking snaps that include shots from both the front and rear camera simultaneously. It's yet to turn into a craze, but if it does become popular, the Nokia 7.1 has you covered.Speaking of reasons why you'll maybe want to pick this phone up, it's also important to note that this is an Android One phone – that means stock Android, free from pointless tweaks and unwanted bloatware, and with a guarantee of speedy updates in the future.You get two years of Android updates and three years of security patches guaranteed with an Android One phone.While our unit was running Android 8 Oreo at the time of this review, the Android 9 Pie update is now available for the device, as indeed it should be on an Android One handset.The Nokia 7.1 probably won't win any design awards or any benchmark tests, but maybe your next smartphone doesn't have to. What we do get here is a winning combination of price, power, specs and features – this is what a mid-range phone should be.Not everything is perfect about the Nokia 7.1 though. The battery life disappoints, and the specs that we mentioned earlier mean the handset doesn't exactly race through tasks like switching between apps or running the latest games. There's no waterproofing here, and no wireless charging, to help keep costs down.Most phones are made up of some compromises though, and the Nokia 7.1 gets most of them right.Design and displayTall, bright, responsive displayQuality if unimaginative designThe Nokia 7.1 doesn't ooze the premium quality of something like the iPhone XS, but we're a fan of the design nonetheless. It takes the now-standard glass sandwich approach, with aluminum edges around the sides, and a 5.84-inch, 19:9 aspect ratio display – the 1,080 x 2,280 resolution gives you a very respectable 432 pixels-per-inch.There's a notch here, which is relatively chunky, and a bottom chin that's rather thick and makes this very obviously a mid-range handset.It didn't offend our eyes too much though – overall it's a good-looking phone front and back, though we wish phone makers would prioritize rear cameras without a bump again. It scores points for its nicely chamfered edges, without an angled corner in sight.Take a look at the slightly more expensive Nokia 7 Plus and the Nokia 7.1 obviously loses, without the extra metal accents and the soft matte backing, but every part of this phone is about the balance between price and quality – and it's a balance that the Nokia 7.1 gets right much more often than not.We found the LCD display bright, sharp and perfectly good for watching movies or checking through emails (that 19:9 aspect ratio really gives you a lot of scrolling room). Colors are vibrant and clean, and you could be fooled into thinking this is a display from a much more expensive phone.In use the screen is punchy and appealing, though this being an LCD display, it can be difficult to view in bright sunlight (that's an issue other LCD screens struggle with too, of course). Overall, from web pages to photos, it really impresses, even more than the appearance of the phone as a whole.As far as the rest of the design goes, we're less sure about the volume buttons above the power button (a Nokia staple), or about them being so high on the right-hand side – it makes it hard to adjust the volume in portrait mode.We did find ourselves getting more used to the layout as the week went on, so no doubt it's something it's possible to get adjusted to eventually.You don't get anything fancy like an in-screen fingerprint scanner – the fingerprint scanner is around the back, as usual. With a thickness of 8mm it's also slightly chunkier than some of the best phones around, though you're not really going to notice the difference."
13,2,2czaodYy7BPbj59YwEcoRg,2czaodYy7BPbj59YwEcoRg,Hands on: Nokia 8 Sirocco India review,,na,na,na,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/nokia-8-sirocco-india,,"The Nokia 8 Sirocco is HMD Global's attempt at creating the ""ultimate statement of flagship design with the latest screen and camera technology"".Although it's a bold claim to make, HMD admits that the Nokia 8 Sirocco is made ""for fans"" who have been asking for a premium flagship that actually pushes the boundaries. Read more: Nokia 7.1It's true to an extent that the Nokia 8 Sirocco ticks all the boxes that the original Nokia 8 missed. The moment I held the phone in my hand, I was impressed. However, with a fleet of new flagships making their way to the market, it wouldn't be as easy for the phone to compete with rivals. Especially with a price tag of Rs 49,999. But that's a question we can answer in our full review.Nokia 8 Sirocco is compact and fits well in hand.Nokia 8 Sirocco availability, price and offersThe Nokia 8 Sirocco will be available at a best buy price of Rs. 49,999.Available in black, consumers can pre-book their Nokia 8 Sirocco starting April 20 from Nokia's online store, Flipkart.com and select retail outlets. The phone will start selling from April 30. Airtel customers buying the Nokia 8 Sirocco will get a data benefit of 120GB. While prepaid customers will get 20GB additional data on each of the first 6 recharges of Rs 199 or Rs 349, postpaid customers can avail 20GB per month on the Rs 399 or Rs 499 plans, for 6 months. Airtel customers will also get an extended free subscription to the Airtel TV app till December 31, 2018 and ICICI bank will offer a 5% cashback till May 31, 2018.Additionally, consumers will get 25% instant discount on domestic hotels at MakeMyTrip. The Nokia 8 Sirocco will be available at no cost EMI on credit cards and through Bajaj FinServ and Home Credit.The new Nokia 8 Sirocco is shiny yet solid smartphoneDesign and displayNew Nokia 8 Sirocco specsDimensions: 140.93 x 72.97 x 7.5mmOS: Android 8Screen size: 5.5 inchesResolution: 2560 x 1440CPU: Snapdragon 835RAM: 6GBStorage: 128GBBattery: 3,260mAhRear camera: 12MP + 13MPFront camera: 5MP With the Nokia 8 Sirocco, the company switches from the blocky design language, in favour of something that looks futuristic and premium. The phone is covered in 95% vacuum moulded Gorilla Glass and has a stainless steel frame at its core.It has a Blackberry Priv-like curved display that matches the build quality of the Galaxy S8. It's made mostly out of glass and shines, but that also makes it prone to fingerprints and it feels slippery. The edges of the Nokia 8 Sirocco taper from 7.5mm to 2mm and it was fun finding the discreetly placed SIM tray on its thinnest point. Similarly, the volume buttons and the power key are flush with the edges, which sometimes makes it a little tricky to click. The phone sits well in your hand, where the curved edges on the back allow it to nestle against your palm. The company purposely used a 5.5-inch display to make the phone compact. The Nokia 8 Sirocco is a short and wide phone that feels really nice to use with one hand, until you get annoyed with the sharp edges on the sides. To compliment the svelte design, the company had topped it with IP67 dust/water resistance and wireless charging.Power, performance and interfaceThe Nokia 8 Sirocco packs plenty of power under the hood, but it's still not the best we have right now.It is backed by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 SoC with 6GB of RAM, which was flagship-class in 2017, and was also used in the original Nokia 8. While Snapdragon 845-powered phones haven't made it to the market just yet, Nokia may have to contend with criticisms for having an older generation chipset. That said, the practical difference between the 835 and 845 is minor.Simply put, it might not compete against upcoming flagships on benchmarks, but it has plenty of power to run pretty much anything you throw at it.You get the stock Android 8 Oreo on the new Nokia 8 SiroccoThe unit we used was fresh out of the box, so we couldn't spot any performance blemishes initially. But this might change once the phone is put to regular use, full of apps, games and other forms of data. Still, stock Android Oreo felt smooth as silk during my limited experience with the phone.It's also enrolled in Google's Android One program, which guarantees the next two big Android updates and three years of security updates.It is powered by a 3,260mAh non-removable battery that we expect should last a day per charge, but you'll have to wait for our in-depth Nokia 8 Sirocco review to find out exactly how it performs.There's Qi wireless charging built in too.CameraThe cameras on the Nokia 8 Sirocco are tuned by Zeiss Optics, an old partner for Nokia phones as far as cameras are concerned. You get a 12MP main camera sensor alongside a 13MP telephoto lens, which lets you click pictures with blurred backgrounds.There are two cameras on the back of the Nokia 8 SiroccoIt also features a Live Bokeh mode that allows you to adjust the level of blur you need in the picture.   Unfortunately, the demo area was dark and we didn't get a chance to test it in daylight. We still managed to take some shots that looked really nice on the phone's display, but we'll put it to test in our full review. Round the front, you get a 5MP camera meant for selfies and video calls. It supports wireless charging.Early verdictThe Nokia 8 Sirocco is a noteworthy upgrade over the original model. It's fast, handy, pretty and brings stock Android software, with a guarantee for updates. All of these are good reasons to buy this phone, though we can only confirm that once we've reviewed it.While the pricing may make it Nokia's least selling phone of the year, if the point of this was to be a full portfolio player on the market, it's goal achieved."

That’s not the case here.While the original Nokia 8 sported a top-end chipset (at the time), a QHD display and a splash-proof design, none of those flagship specs feature on this revamped version of the phone - this is a distinctly mid-range affair.If you’re still interested in a mid-range Nokia phone, we have a full review of the handset below, where we run through what we like and dislike about the Nokia 8.1.Nokia 8.1 release date and price Out now in the UK and costs £379.99May be released in the US thanks to a deal with carriersAnnounced late in 2018, the Nokia 8.1 is available around the world now from a variety of different retailers. However, there’s still no clear release date for those in the US or Australia.HMD Global has brought most of its Nokia phones to Australia in the past, so fingers crossed this will also be one to land there. We haven’t seen many Nokia phones in the US for a while, but the company has just announced it will be partnering with US networks Verizon and Cricket Wireless to bring its phones to the market.Exactly when that will be remains unclear, but that may mean you’re able to buy the Nokia 8.1 in the US in the coming months. In the UK, the price is set at £379.99 (roughly $485 / AU$665), which considering it’s a mid-range device is a good price compared to a lot of the competition.Design and displayGlass on the front and back, aluminium around the sidesA large 6.18-inch Full HD+ displayFeatures a 3.5mm headphone jack, not waterproofThe Nokia 8.1 is essentially a larger Nokia 7.1 when you hold it in your hand. A lot of the design elements are similar, this is just a larger version of that handset, but it’s still not impossible to hold. With dimensions of 154.8 x 75.8 x 8mm it’s easy enough for most people to hold, and it isn’t too heavy at 180g.A lot of the design elements we’ve come to like from newer HMD Global-made Nokia handsets are here, and overall the design is attractive if not premium.Image 1 of 2Image 2 of 2The front and rear of the phone is made of glass, and there’s an aluminum frame holding the whole thing together. Our grip wasn’t fantastic on the phone at first because of that glass back, but it’s something we got used to after a few days of using it.The corners of the rear of the phone are rounded meaning it sits in the palm of your hand comfortably. The rear of the phone houses a fingerprint scanner that we found to work quickly and be in an easily reachable position.The camera sits above the scanner. It’s raised out from the back of the phone quite a long way. In fact, it protrudes out another 1.5mm over the phone, meaning the handset won’t sit down flat on a desk next to you. It’s not out far enough that it becomes uncomfortable in a pocket, though.The bottom edge of the Nokia 8.1 features a USB-C port as well as the single speaker, which is remarkably easy to cover up. You may find that an annoyance when watching video. The side edges of the phone are clear apart from a volume rocker, power button and the SIM tray.Image 1 of 3Image 2 of 3Image 3 of 3Then the top edge of the phone features a 3.5mm headphone jack, which anyone who likes wired headsets is sure to appreciate sticking around for this latest generation of Nokia handsets.The bezels around the display are thin, especially for a mid-ranger. There’s a notch at the top of the display to hide away the selfie camera and other tech, but we couldn’t get it to look like a normal notch.Instead, the two sides of the notch are covered in black and house the information you’d expect such as the time, notifications and battery level. So in other words the notch is semi-hidden. To be able to properly display the notch you’ll need to have developer software running on the phone, which is something we weren’t able to do.The 8.1 in the name of this phone doesn’t refer to the size of the screen, luckily. Instead the Nokia 8.1 features a 6.18-inch display with a Full HD+ resolution. That’s 2280 x 1080, with a pixel density of 408ppi.We found the display is good enough for the size of the phone. Picture quality isn’t incredible as it isn’t a QHD panel, and the technology used here is an IPS LCD rather than AMOLED. That said, for the price of this phone you’re unlikely to be disappointed with how the Nokia 8.1 looks. It’s around an 81% screen to body ratio though, so you’re not going to be getting an all-screen front on this handset..One final thing to note is that this isn’t waterproof. You won’t be able to get your Nokia 8.1 particularly wet, and we don’t currently know its exact IP rating so it may not even do well in the rain. That’s a shame if you’re after a durable device, but it’s not all that common that we see mid-range phones with high IP ratings to protect from water damage."

Even though it seems like there can’t be a meaningful upgrade to the OnePlus 6, the company, following their two-phones-a-year strategy launched the OnePlus 6T this week. OnePlus says they’ll only make ‘T’ variants of their smartphones when there’s enough progression in the technology that’s being put in the phone. From outside, the OnePlus 6T doesn’t seem like a major upgrade, which has been a constant with other ‘T’ variants, but the 6T packs some upgrades that are technologically advanced and meaningful.The OnePlus 6T is the result of OnePlus' attempt to further enhance the OnePlus 6 with incremental upgrades without hampering what’s already good. So, it has almost the same internals as the OnePlus 6, but with some noticeable upgrades.The 6T gets an in-display fingerprint sensor feature called Screen Unlock, and a hefty 3700mAh battery, which is a 23% increase in the size against the predecessor and an immersive display with a smaller notch. It’s not that the OnePlus 6 was inferior in any sense, instead, it’s just that the 6T is a more advanced device on the way to their next flagship.OnePlus 6T price and availabilityOnePlus 6T launch price: from Rs 37,999OnePlus 6T release date: November 1OnePlus 6T specsWeight: 185gDimensions: 157.5 x 74.8 x 8.2mmOS: Android 9Screen size: 6.41 inchesResolution: 1080 x 2340CPU: Snapdragon 845RAM: 6GB/8GBStorage: 128GB/64GBBattery: 3,700mAhRear camera: 16MP + 20MPFront camera: 16MPThe OnePlus 6T will be available in two color variants - Midnight Black and Mirror Black. It goes on sale from November 1 on Amazon.in and OnePlus store along with being available in Reliance Digital and Croma stores across India. .The 6GB RAM/128GB storage variant is priced at Rs 37,999, 8/128 variant for Rs 41,999 and the high-end 8/256 for Rs 45,999.Display85.6% screen to body ratio is highest even on a OnePlus phoneTinier notch, same resolutionThe 6.41-inch full HD display on the 6T is immersiveThe major change in the display arrived with the OnePlus 5T, where the company decided to chop off extra bezels and adopt an 18:9 display. The process continued on the OnePlus 6 with the introduction of a notch, which is now shrunken even more on the OnePlus 6T. Which allows it more screen space to fit more icons on the top left and right of the display.The display is a 6.41-inch AMOLED panel having 19.6:9 aspect ratio. Thanks to its 85.6% screen to body ratio, the phone doesn’t feel large in hand despite the big screen size. There’s no upgrade in the display resolution this time as well. It has a full HD (2340 x 1080p) display with 402ppi pixel density. But in all honesty, the AMOLED display on the OnePlus 6T still offers gorgeous picture quality. The colors pop, it looks immersive and there’s no compromise with the details.What’s new in the display is its key feature - the in-display fingerprint sensor. We’ve seen many other smartphones like the Vivo Nex and Oppo Find X using a similar technology, but OnePlus claims itself to have the fastest unlock time of 0.36 seconds on this one. Evidently, it’s not as snappy as the older fingerprint solution on OnePlus phones (which is insanely fast), but good enough to set a stepping stone for their next flagship. It’s not just a cool thing to have on your phone, it also helps phone makers to save space for a bigger battery or display panel.The fingerprint sensor is under the display.During tests, my first impression with the screen unlock was way better than what I experienced on the Vivo X21. This version of the technology seemed refined, unlike the unbaked solution on competing phones. Of course, there is a learning curve in the beginning, but once I got into a habit of it, it was quite smooth, but sadly not the fastest way to unlock. I reiterate that it’s not as fast as the conventional fingerprint sensor and has its issues with sweaty fingers or delay in registering, but it worked well enough in most cases. I’ll still suggest you to keep the face unlock as the backup option until you get in a natural habit of unlocking using the display. You will get to use the screen unlock, but only if face unlock allows you the time to. DesignPremium glass metal body looks and feels greatSlightly bulkier than the OnePlus 6Premium body finishOnePlus has done splendid enhancements in their smartphone design over the years. But of all the designs, the OnePlus 6 looked like their most premium work till date and that’s a constant on the OnePlus 6T. The company uses a 3D glass back on the phone which looks great without compromising with the essentials. The OnePlus 6T is made out of exactly the same glass and metal material as its predecessor. There are only a few changes in the overall look and feel and the changes are well implemented.Front this time has a Gorilla Glass 6 protection, and the body is glass. It’s available in two colors--Midnight black and Mirror black. The base variant is only available in the Mirror Black variant, which I personally find more interesting as the matte finish is quite mainstream. Going by history, OnePlus would most likely bring in more color variants in the next few months. The phone feels comfortable to hold, and it’s easy enough to grip – with dimensions of 157.5 x 74.8 x 8.2mm it’s not a large device. In comparison to the OnePlus 6, the 6T is 0.4mm thicker and heavier by 8 grams. It has a relatively thinner chin and top bezelThe back of the phone is relatively cleaner, as there is only the camera setup since the fingerprint is moved under the display. On the right edge of the phone is a power on button, which is one of your options for waking the device – the other is a double tap on the screen - and above that is the signature OnePlus slider that allows you to mute your phone with a quick flick. On the left edge of the phone is an easily reachable volume rocker, a USB Type-C at the bottom and two grills on each side having a loudspeaker and microphone. As already revealed, one of the biggest change is the missing headphone jack. The decision might have upset some OnePlus fans, but the company believes it’s a necessary change that had to happen sooner or later. To cover up, OnePlus is bundling a USB Type-C to 3.5mm adapter in the box. Moreover, the OnePlus Bullets headphone are now available with USB Type-C connectivity.Hard truth is that a headphone jack is still an essential requirement of the users in India. It was OnePlus which made much of a fact that they have retained the headphone jack in their previous phones while mocking the competition.OnePlus 6T photo galleryImage 1 of 6Image 2 of 6Image 3 of 6Image 4 of 6Image 5 of 6Image 6 of 6"

We've not yet been given any word on US availability.Most recently though, the Oppo FInd X launched in the UK on January 29, 2019 and will set you back £799.There’s little doubt that this is Oppo’s boldest smartphone to date – in both pricing and features – but whether or not it’s worth the investment will ultimately depend on what you’re after, and what alternatives are available in your region.While its novel display and camera design won’t surpass gimmick-status for many, and may even be considered a hindrance to some, its premium power and prettiness definitely make it worthy of consideration against even more expensive flagship competition.Key featuresBrilliant notchless displayPop-up camera and sensorsTop-shelf specs3D facial recognitionWithout a doubt, the notchless AMOLED display and counterpart pop-up camera array are the features that define the Find X, for better and for worse.

So much so, in fact, that it might even sway cost-minded consumers away from the likes of Apple and Samsung.Read more: Vivo V9In the West, the 6.01-inch R11s has only launched in Australia so far, where it's priced at AU$659 (about $518, £370). Those who prefer their handsets even more phablet-sized also have the choice of the Oppo R11s Plus, which has a 6.43-inch display and is priced at AU$779 (around $612, £438). In both instances, the phones are less than half the AU price of an iPhone X or Samsung Galaxy Note 8, which will be quite a selling point for many people.That said, despite sporting some high-end features, the R11s is undeniably a mid-range phone, as it lacks a few of the key aspects we've come to expect from flagship handsets. Still, if you can look past those shortcomings, the Oppo R11s offers terrific value.Check out the best Oppo R11s plans in AustraliaKey featuresTiny bezels make the R11s feel modern64GB of internal storage can be expanded to 256GBFace unlockFingerprint scannerOne of the key improvements that the R11s holds over its predecessor is a drastically-reduced bezel size, giving the phone a similarly-modern look to the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Huawei Mate 10 Pro. Those smaller top and bottom bezels (which are less than half of the size of what they were on the R11) mean Oppo's had to drop the physical home button that's featured on the front of pretty much every one of its phones up until this point. Instead, the company's now opted to use an on-screen navigation bar, while also moving the fingerprint sensor to the rear of the phone.Oppo's fingerprint sensors have always been incredibly fast, and the R11s is no exception, with the phone unlocking in what seems like a split second. Our favorite new feature? Face unlock, which was introduced on the Oppo F5 but seemingly perfected (or at the very least, greatly improved) here. We can't say for certain whether it's more or less secure than Samsung's own facial recognition tech, though.According to the disclaimer in the 'About Face Recognition' section of the phone's settings, Oppo states that ""Your phone may be unlocked by someone with a similar appearance or objects shaped like you,"" which doesn't offer a whole lot of confidence. Still, we tried to fool our R11s with several selfies taken on another handset and couldn't get it to unlock. After three failed attempts, the R11s required the PIN to be entered.One flaw with the face unlock that was implemented on the Oppo F5 was that you had to hit the power button for it to kick into gear. The Oppo R11s has fixed that thanks to a 'raise to wake' feature, which bypasses this button press and means you only have to lift your phone up and face it for it to unlock. And the R11s' facial-recognition is so lightning fast that, on most occasions, you won't even see your lock screen.Design and displayFull HD+ (18:9 aspect ratio) AMOLED screenVery similar to iOS layoutAs is typical of most smartphones, you'll find the power button on the right side of the screen and a volume rocker on the left. It's got a combination dual SIM and microSD slot on the right side of its all-metal unibody chassis, which has such thin edges that it actually feel a little strange in the hand when the phone is naked.When its case is off (Oppo continues its much-appreciated tradition of including a clear gel phone case in the box), it also has a significant camera bump, made all the more noticeable by its wide, dual-camera nature. Music lovers will be happy to know that a 3.5mm headphone jack has been mercifully included on the bottom of the unit to the right of its Micro USB port. Yes, you read that correctly – it appears that Oppo isn't ready to jump on the USB-C bandwagon just yet.Along the top and bottom edges of the phone you'll find some fairly subtle iPhone 7-style antenna lines, which were barely noticeable on our black review unit. The Oppo R11s offers a hefty 64GB of on-board storage, and that can be expanded by a further 256GB thanks to its aforementioned microSD card slot.Likewise, the fact that the R11s already has a screen protector on it right out of the box is something we love. It's a thoughtful touch that saves customers from the hassle of purchasing and then awkwardly applying one themselves. It's the kind of practice we wish more phone manufacturers would adopt.The Oppo R11s may have more screen real estate available than its predecessor (the phone's display now takes up 85% of its front), but its resolution remains in the 1080p realm (2,160 x 1,080). Thankfully, it's got a gorgeous AMOLED screen with a pixel density of 401ppi, offering inky blacks, vibrant colors and exceptional brightness. In the past, we've noted Oppo's tendency to oversaturate the colors on its displays, but that isn't the case here. Want to get the best deal on an Oppo R11s in Australia?

We’ve said it a lot in the past, and it’s a niche that Oppo fills well, especially with the R15 Pro.The last Oppo we reviewed was the R11s, and the R15 Pro is a clear evolution on that. It’s definitely the Chinese company's best phone to date, and takes a lot of design cues from Apple, Huawei and Samsung. If you’re going to be influenced by anyone, be influenced by the best.In Australia, the Oppo R15 Pro is priced at AU$779. That’s amazing value when you consider the phone's premium design and features. While it's true that it's somewhat channeling the iPhone X in its design, it retains more of an identity than some other Android handsets, such as the Huawei P20 Pro.Ultimately, this is an excellent handset for the price, with some of the best and worst aspects of contemporary phone design, and a number of quirks and characteristics familiar to Oppo phones. If you don’t mind all this, then you can save yourself a great deal of cash by grabbing this handset.Key features128GB of internal storage can be expanded by an additional 256GBFace unlock and fingerprint scannerSlim bezelsWater resistantIf you happen to live in a metropolitan area, you've likely seen the huge billboards for Oppo’s latest phone. Here’s a phone made for capturing the essence of the outdoors, they say, and there’s certainly truth in that advertising, but for a phone that relies so heavily on its camera, does it cut the mustard?Before we dive into the quality of its snapper, let's see what the Chinese manufacturer has done to improve on its predecessor, the Oppo R11s, that only launched in Australia six months prior.Features such as NFC connectivity and water-resistance (IP67) are welcome additions in the contemporary world of smartphones, sitting nicely alongside the handset's notch-touting display and dazzling all-glass rear. The increase to internal storage from 64GB to 128GB is also quite welcome.Thanks to its notch and an even thinner chin bezel, the display takes up more than 84% of the phone's face, increasing it to 6.28-inches and cementing its place in phablet territory.Unfortunately, not all of 2018's standard features have made it the R15 Pro, with a micro-USB port still found on the phone's base (albeit with fast-charging capabilities) and overall performance and battery life that doesn't quite cut it against some of its premium competition.Similarly, Oppo's camera app can be a little obtuse with its array of quirkier modes and settings – beautification being a prime example – but this should come as no surprise to anyone who's used an Android phone from the likes of Huawei, Samsung, Google or any of the other major players in the last few years.These somewhat niche settings and modes can be used to varying effect, but the phone's primary camera mode is where it truly shines. The dual lens setup makes for some truly wonderful shots, and along with HDR can bring a landscape to life or add rich depth to a portrait.Design and displayNotched Full HD+ (19:9 aspect ratio) AMOLED screenColorOS sticks with iOS-esque layoutAside from the notched display, the first thing you'll notice is just how handsome the chassis looks. We were able to test the handset out in both Cosmic Purple and Ruby Red, with each offering a different breed of iridescent shimmer that played with the light in subtle and tasteful ways.The display is rich, bright and clear with its FHD+ (1,080 x 2,280) resolution and, despite its 6.28-inch dimensions, doesn't feel oversized thanks to its 19:9 aspect ratio.Delicate curves and a comfortable weight make the phone a pleasure to hold, and the negligible camera bump can be mitigated with the included gel case, which adds more texture. Thanks to the stellar facial recognition system, the screen will turn on from face down to firing in roughly 1.3 seconds. It’s near instantaneous if you use the rear-mounted fingerprint sensor instead."

The firm has built a reputation for making attractive, powerful devices at rock-bottom prices, earning a commanding position in the Indian and Chinese markets, particularly over the past five years.It's now going even deeper on this path, as now Xiaomi has brought an even-cheaper handset, the Pocophone F1.Packing the kind of specification not seen at this sort of price since the original OnePlus One, the Pocophone F1 features many of the internals of handsets selling for £1000/$1000/AU$1,500, but for a lot less.That specifically means a Snapdragon 845 chipset, 64GB or 128GB of storage, 6GB or 8GB of RAM, and a 4,000mAh battery, along with a dual-lens camera. Given it's starting at £309 (roughly $390, AU$555) but selling for £349 (around $440, AU$630) in the UK on Amazon, the question remains on how it can be created for such a low price.Pocophone F1 release date and priceOut now in the UKStarts at £309 (roughly $390, AU$555)The Pocophone F1’s price starts at £309 (roughly $390, AU$555) directly from Xiaomi, with prices rising depending on the configuration and retailer chosen.There are four variants, with the three main ones being as follows - 6GB of RAM with 64GB of storage, 6GB of RAM with 128GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM with 256GB of storage.An ‘Armoured Edition’ also exists, packing 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage but trading the polycarbonate build for solid Kevlar, but this isn’t available yet for purchase in the UK. Nor, for that matter, is the normal 8GB of RAM model.Xiaomi phones are not yet directly on sale in the US, and the firm has also yet to officially expand to Australia.This is the Armoured EditionMinimalist, durable designPlain but sturdy designArmoured Edition offers more durabilityOne thing is for sure about the Pocophone F1 - it doesn't feel like a piece of precision-engineering. While the likes of Honor and Nokia are doing all they can to bring glass and metal all-screen designs to lower price brackets, Xiaomi is forging a different path.The Pocophone, like the original Oneplus One, is a plastic creation. That isn’t to say that it feels cheap (indeed it feels durable and dependable), but it lacks the spirit of more premium designs. It is almost utilitarian in its minimalism, so those who like to express themselves through their phones will want to invest in a skin or a case.The front of the phone houses the 6.18 inch, 18.7:9 aspect ratio display, which is bordered by a sizable notch at the top. This houses the infrared face sensor (fast, but not secure) and a 20MP f/2.0 selfie camera.There's also a thick chin at the bottom, which means the Pocophone F1 isn’t designed to compete with the bigger flagships on every point.The Kevlar back feels soft and allows a good gripOur review model came in a matte polycarbonate painted navy blue, other models come in red or ‘Kevlar’, the latter offering extra durability.In short, this isn’t one for the fashionistas and glitterati of the world, however for the power user - or those who value longevity in their handsets - the design will be a breath of fresh air.It is a harrowing experience watching a beloved £1000/$1000 glass sandwich tumble in slow motion towards an unforgiving pavement. Plastic handles such impacts far better than these harder materials. Saying this, it won’t conduct heat as well as metal devices, meaning overheating could be an issue a few years down the line.The Armoured Edition of course feels better than the polycarbonate variants. The good thing about it is that it's not slippery or fragile, so you don't need to put a case on the back like glass phones such as the OnePlus 6, Honor 10 or the Asus Zenfone 5Z.Its look isn't the most intriguing part of the phone, but in practice it is a welcome balance between form and function. In fact, if you are a fan of older Motorola designs with textured backs then the Armoured Edition in particular will feel right at home in the hand.This is a phone with a design all of its own, totally unique in the market at the moment, taking trends that are a few years old at this point and updating them for the modern age.Pleasingly, the camera bump on the rear is kept to a minimum, and the easy-to-find fingerprint reader works both quickly and reliably.At 182g in weight and 8.8mm thick, in combination with the larger screen, this isn’t a device for easy one-handed use. But this is a design that incorporates a large battery and a headphone jack, so it's sure to please many for that reason.Display6.18-inch 1080 x 2246 screenCan get bright, but auto brightness is erraticThe Pocophone F1 features a 6.18-inch FHD+ (1080 x 2246) display, coated with Gorilla Glass 3. Though this isn’t the newest version, it does come with its own strengths. Previous versions, such as 3, were more resistant to scratches, meaning that while less shatterproof this will survive a trip in a pocket full of coins a little better.This is another in the long trend of manufacturers mostly abandoning the 2K dreams of several years ago. Instead, Full HD+ panels have appeared with a vengeance, offering lower pixel density but with important trade-offs in improved battery endurance and better overall performance.Needless to say, the screen can reach both very dim and very bright levels, however the auto brightness is quite erratic. Color reproduction was a little cool for our tastes, but the MIUI software has ample screen tuning abilities built in. We switched to the ‘warm’ preset, which improved things considerably.The tall 18.7:9 screen may not be the newest trend on the market anymore, however it makes for an immersive viewing experience on the Pocophone F1.The only real improvement could have been found by trading up to an OLED screen, but that would have entailed a rise in cost. This isn’t a screen which breaks boundaries for the price point, however it is certainly good enough.One surprising issue, which was difficult to replicate, is a slightly odd touch problem. Occasionally, and especially when using the home screen, taps seemed to register in the wrong place, often opening the wrong app. This was irritating, and will hopefully be solved in a future software update."
21,2,9FM5frUF7CVn6cp2XQ3PPN,9FM5frUF7CVn6cp2XQ3PPN,Samsung Galaxy A7 (2018) review,,na,na,na,https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-a7-2018,,"The Samsung Galaxy A7 is a phone that you might notice because of its looks, explore because of its display and buy because of its camera. That's the kind of balance that Samsung has tried to strike with their first triple camera phone.From what we saw on paper, the Galaxy A7 (2018) looked like a phone that's made for everyone. And by everyone, we mean that it packs a decent set of hardware in a premium looking shell and a camera you can get creative with.At its price, the 4GB RAM variant of the three cameras, the primary is a 24-megapixel sensor with a f/1.7 aperture, the secondary is an 8MP sensor and ultra-wide lens with a f/2.4 aperture, and finally, there's a 5MP depth sensor with a fixed-focus lens and f/2.2 aperture. The highlight here is the 8MP sensor as it has a 13mm 'ultra-wide' lens with a 120-degree field of view. It also has a big 6-inch Super AMOLED full HD (1080p) display, that's best in the league for multimedia consumption. The company also emphasizes on the Widevine L1 certification, which enables users to stream content in HD.DesignMetal and glass designmicro USB chargingFlat surfaceFrom the very first look, it's easy to guess that the Galaxy A7 is a Samsung phone. The quality of material and the precision of finish is seen on flagship phones like the Galaxy Note 9. Similar to its predecessor, the Galaxy A7 (2018) comes in a glass and metal sandwich design, but without any curves on the sides. It gets a rich-looking reflective glass surface on the rear, that shifts shades in different light. Since it's back is all glass, it's a given that it's a fingerprint magnet and prone to cracking when dropped with an impact. But I have an instance to share. It was my first day with the Galaxy A7 and I accidentally slipped it on a marble flooring from a height of about three feet. The sound gave me instant chills, but to my surprise, it survived. While that doesn't qualify it to be called as a shatterproof phone, but I would still call it a sturdy and well-built handset. A sturdy body-colored aluminum rim surrounds the body. It has rounded corners and curves to give it a pleasant in hand feel. Although, its big size makes it difficult to operate with one hand. There's a welcome change in the design this time. After experimenting with the fingerprint sensor on their phones, Samsung finally put fingerprint into the power/lock key like Sony Xperia handsets. You don't have to make an extra effort to reach, as it falls right under the thumb while holding it with the right hand. The power button is still clickable, but you don’t need to press it to unlock the phone.The triple camera placement is very subtle. The setup resides on the top left corner with a LED flash below it. We must say that Samsung does a great job at keeping the handsets void of any unusual camera protrusion. Even on the Galaxy A7, there's a very tiny bump despite the three cameras.On the front, the Galaxy A7 looks like its other cousins. There's no sign of a notch on top, instead, there's a thick chin and a forehead where it resides the earpiece, front camera and an LED flash. So, don't expect a notch or even a nearly bezeless design. It looks more like the Pixel 2 XL from last year from the front. The volume is placed above the power key/fingerprint sensor on the right side. The SIM and microSD card slot is on the left and the 3.5mm audio jack, loudspeaker and a micro USB port are at the bottom. In all honesty, a micro USB is one of the biggest letdowns on the Galaxy A7. Especially, when OEMs like Nokia are putting a Type-C on phones priced below Rs 15,000. Display6-inch 18.5:9 LCD screen, 1080 x 2220 pixelsNo notchThe Samsung Galaxy A7 (2018) has a tall 6-inch 18.5:9 Super AMOLED panel with full HD (1080x2220p) resolution. Like most Samsung displays, this one is punchy and vivid straight out of the box. AMOLED panels are naturally crisp and reproduce vivid color tones, and the same is the case on the Galaxy A7. It is sharper than almost every other phone in its league and can be rated as the finest display among the competition. The sheer size of the display makes the Galaxy A7 makes it a well-suited phone for gaming, video streaming and scrolling social media content.Brightness levels are high, making it clearly visible under bright and sunny outdoors. It can also be viewed from extreme angles without any obstruction."
"qaFwLHCnP2YL5MHQVxtkdc~Hands on: Samsung Galaxy A9 (2018) review~https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-a9-2018-hands-on~ ~ ~ ~The Samsung Galaxy A9 (2018) has four rear cameras. Yes, you read that right, four. It's a world's first, and while it may seem excessive Samsung believes the additional hardware makes for better photos.Samsung goes as far as to say the Galaxy A9 is 'optimized for Instagram', which gives you a clear indication at who this handset is aimed at. Young adults where camera experience is king and social media is a daily ritual.Unsurprisingly, the main focus of the Samsung Galaxy A9 is its quad-cam setup round the back, but with a 6.3-inch Full HD+ display, 6GB of RAM, 128GB of storage (plus microSD slot) and a 3,800mAh battery it offers up a decent array of specs.It sits atop Samsung's mid-range A series of devices, sliding in just under the flagship Galaxy S line - offering some top-end features at a more attractive price point.This means the new Samsung Galaxy A9 has the likes of the OnePlus 6T and Honor View 20 to contend with in an increasingly competitive 'affordable flagship' segment.While the Samsung Galaxy A9 is now available to buy, we're still waiting on our review device. Once it arrives, we'll get to work putting it through our in-depth review process.Samsung Galaxy A9 (2018) release date and priceThe Samsung Galaxy A9 is available in the UK both SIM free and on a range of contracts.The Samsung Galaxy A9 price is £449 (around $580, AU$800) SIM free, making it around the same price as the the Honor View 20 and OnePlus 6T, and comfortably cheaper than the Samsung Galaxy S9.DesignThe Samsung Galaxy A9 has a premium design with a metal frame and a glass front and rear, insuring the handset looks and feels the part.It's available in three colors, with the most eye-catching options being lemonade blue and bubblegum pink, which boast attractive two-tone hues which are reminiscent of the fancier finishes on the Huawei P20 and P20 Pro.For those who want their phone to be a little more understated, the Samsung Galaxy A9 is also available in caviar black.Measuring 162.5 x 77 x 7.8mm, the Samsung Galaxy A9 is a sizable handsets - thanks in part to the 6.3-inch display - which makes slightly taller and wider than the Samsung Galaxy Note 9.It's lighter than the firm's supersized phablet though, weighing in at 183g. It means that while there's no getting away from the fact that this is a big phone in the hand, it doesn't feel overbearing.The glass back doesn't provide much grip however, so one handed use feels a little precarious (a case may be required for peace of mind), plus it's a fingerprint magnet. We had to wipe the rear numerous times during our hands on preview of the Galaxy A9 so get clean pictures for you.The rear mounted fingerprint scanner falls nicely under forefinger, while the power/lock and volume keys on the right can be hit relatively easily is you've got larger hands.Samsung Galaxy A9 (2018) hands on galleryImage 1 of 10Image 2 of 10Image 3 of 10Image 4 of 10Image 5 of 10Image 6 of 10Image 7 of 10Image 8 of 10Image 9 of 10Image 10 of 10Flip to the left side of the Samsung Galaxy A9 and there's another physical button - Samsung's Bixby button. This key launches the firm's smart voice assistant, and while it may not be to everyone's taste, its inclusion in a non-flagship device is another example of Samsung filtering down its top-tier tech.There's good news for audiophiles on the base of the Samsung Galaxy A9, as a headphone jack resides alongside a USB-C port and single, down-firing speaker.DisplayThe Samsung Galaxy A9 (2018) packs a 6.3-inch Super AMOLED Full HD+ display which is bright, clear and colorful.While the 1080 x 2220 resolution isn't as impressive as the QHD panels on the Galaxy S9, S9 Plus and Note 9, for its price point it's hard to knock the Full HD+ offering on the Galaxy A9.You can see the design language of Samsung's flagship infinity display spilling over to the Galaxy A9, but it's not quite as edge-to-edge here, with slightly thicker boarders all the way around the device.That's to be expected considering the Samsung Galaxy A9's price point, and there's still plenty of screen to enjoy here - and no notch, which may please some users.CameraWe've already mentioned it, and there is no denying that this is the main draw for the Samsung Galaxy A9 - the quad-cam offering on the rear of the handset.The primary camera is a 24MP offering which is the default option in auto mode, and the one which will give you best low light performance.Next up is an 8MP, 120 degree wide angle lens allowing you to get more into each shot, followed by a 5MP depth-sensing camera which collects data used in Samsung's Live Focus background blur mode.Finally there's a 10MP telephoto lens providing a 2x optical zoom over the primary camera, allowing you to get closer to the action.Up until now some of these features have been provided by software, but Samsung claims the move to hardware will garner better results. Meanwhile, round the front there's a 24MP selfie camera with its own.During our brief time with the Samsung Galaxy A9 we found the primary camera was generally good, but if you zoom into shots after taking them the detail gets muddy pretty easily. It's worth noting that the Galaxy A9 we got our hands on wasn't running final camera software, so image quality may improve before the handset officially goes on sale. There are plenty of options in the camera app too, but Auto mode will likely be the most used mode.You'll need to select the Live Focus mode to shoot Bokeh, background blurred, images on the Galaxy A9, which uses the 24MP primary and 5MP depth sensing cameras.However, you can switch between the primary, zoom and wide-angle cameras easily from auto mode. A small, on-screen prompt appears in the viewfinder area, allowing you to tap between the three options, getting you closer to the action or expanding the field of view to fit more in.Battery and performanceThe Samsung Galaxy A9 comes with an octa-core Exynos 7885 chipset and 6GB of RAM which provides a decent slug of power.It's in charge of running Android 8 Oreo, which is sadly not the latest version of Google's mobile software. Samsung tells us that it will bring the Android 9 Pie update to the Galaxy A9 as soon as it's can, but it's still working on adapting the platform with its own interface.While not date was given for the Android Pie update, we don't expect it to land on the Galaxy A9 until early next year.Android does run smoothly on the Galaxy A9, and we experienced slick performance and fast app load times during our time with the handset.There's good news in terms of storage, with the Samsung Galaxy A9 coming with a sizable 128GB of space built-in. If that's not enough space (although for most it will be) there's also a microSD slot which supports cards up to 512GB in size.The Samsung Galaxy A9 also fits in a 3,800mAh battery which is bigger than the power packs squeezed into the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9 Plus. The hope is the Galaxy A9 will offer up some impressive battery life, but you'll have to wait for our full review to find out just how well it performs.There isn't any wireless charging included here, but the Samsung Galaxy A9 does support fast charging, allowing you to quickly top up the battery if you are running low.Early verdictThe Samsung Galaxy A9 is a good looking, feature packed smartphone with standout camera spec. Whether that camera spec lives up to Samsung's hype remains to be seen - keep an eye out for our in-depth review - but the early signs are positive."
"8PM9AQMLavdTqzJLJcg9BK~Samsung Galaxy J2 Core review~https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-j2-core~ ~ ~ ~Samsung’s first Android Go smartphone, the Galaxy J2 Core is strictly entry-level. It wouldn't be wrong to say that this phone caters to an audience who wants to have their first encounter with smartphones. The Galaxy J2 Core is Samsung’s own take on Android Go and hence comes with some of its own distinct features. Priced at ₹6,190, the J2 Core treads a fine line against the competition, but is it able to balance it? We find out. Also Read: What is Android Go? How Google plans to bring a better Android to low-end phonesSamsung Galaxy J2 Core release date and priceThe Samsung Galaxy J2 Core is already available in brick-and-mortar stores as well as e-tailers, Flipkart, Amazon India and Samsung India Shop. The phone is priced at ₹6,190.DesignRight of the box, the J2 Core feels good in the hand. The chassis is plastic but it is the slight shimmer that gives it a different look altogether. Although, over time this shimmer will lose its charm and being a plastic back, scratches and scuff marks would eventually get on that back panel.The phone is sturdy to hold and feels like could take a beating or two. More so than playing safe, Samsung has done a good job with the design of the J2 Core because it is different. Of course, the plastic is there but then let’s also look at the price.During the course of our review, we think that nearly every feature set of the J2 Core boils down to the price it is being offered at. The rear panel of the phone is removable for placing in a 2,600mAh battery, dual SIM cards and a microSD card. Going with a dedicated memory card slot earns Samsung some points. The back also houses a cleverly crafted camera module, which at first gives off an impression of being a dual camera setup but of course, you forgot the pricing, did you?Instead, the camera module is placed in a way that it also contains the LED flash. A speaker unit is housed right adjacent to the camera.The edges of the J2 Core have a matte finishing giving the phone a grip to be held in hands. The right edge houses the volume up/down buttons while the left side is home to the power button. There’s a micro-USB port along with a 3.5mm headphone jack on the bottom edge of the phone.Overall, there are no downsides to the design of the phone as it does the basics right. We believe users will increasingly like the built of the J2 Core.DisplaySamsung Galaxy J2 Core features a 5-inch LCD panel which has a quad-HD (960x540 pixels) resolution and a pixel density of 220 ppi. Being an entry-level smartphone, the display is fine for normal usage but we were expecting an HD panel, at the very least. Then again, the display is one of the areas where the price of the phone comes into play which is why it loses some points.Consuming content on the J2 Core is a breeze, first due to the YouTube Go app being specifically optimized for Android Go phones. Second, the display has a good color reproduction but has low sunlight legibility.So, as Samsung is targeting first-time smartphone buyers, experience must be a priority. The display is good in day to day usage, it’s not the best one but does the job just fine.CameraSamsung Galaxy J2 Core comes sporting an 8-megapixel camera on the back assisted by a LED flash along with a 5-megapixel selfie snapper on the front. Both the cameras offer a f/2.2 aperture and have features like Beauty Mode for enhancing your selfies.The camera is another department where the phone loses points. We expected a better camera performance from the J2 Core. Having said that, the camera is above average and can take those occasional pictures and selfies.Pictures created by the camera on the J2 Core have a bluish tint to them. It does manage to capture details but only in bright light. In low light, the camera’s performance is not good at all and a lot of noise creeps into the frame. Again, for its asking price, the J2 Core does an average job with its cameras. Anyone particularly looking for a camera-phone under budget will be disappointed with the J2 Core.Image 1 of 4Image 2 of 4Image 3 of 4Image 4 of 4PerformanceThe J2 Core is powered by Exynos 7570, Samsung's homegrown chipset which is supported by a quad-core Cortex-A53 CPU clocked at 1.4GHz along with 1GB of RAM and 8GB of storage. The storage can be extended further by using a microSD card up to 256GB.On the communications front, the phone supports 2.4GHz Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Bluetooth v4.2 and comes with an accelerometer, a proximity sensor and location services support.The J2 Core runs on Android 8.1 Oreo (Go Edition) which should ideally have a stock interface. Samsung's phone, however, has a neat trick up its sleeve and instead of going with the stock Android interface, it comes with a highly optimized version of Samsung Experience UX.In our usage of the J2 Core, we didn't find any lags and neither did we run into any errors as such. Our use consisted of various activities throughout the day, including browsing the internet and social media feeds watching videos in high quality on YouTube among other things.Now, of course, this isn't a phone for power users and as such, we didn't fill it up to the brim with excessive apps and games. Speaking of games, the phone will be able to run titles that have fewer graphics requirement, easily. Also, we'd like to mention here that users might have a hard time if they want to play intensive titles like PUBG Mobile and Asphalt 9, even on low settings.The audio on the J2 Core is a tad bit on the lower end of the spectrum, so don’t expect good sound quality from the speaker, it’s above average on its best days.As far as the performance of the phone goes, we weren't too impressed due to Samsung's implementation of their own skin. However, the company did it so as to create consistency across its smartphone range which in turn lets it stand out from the crowd. Then there was a case of people who love Samsung’s UI.BatteryThe 2,600mAh battery aboard the J2 Core was easily able to last for a day on a single charge, that is when used moderately. Our usage pattern consists of browsing the web, endlessly scrolling through Facebook, Instagram and Twitter feed along with a combined hour of video viewing. Although in some similar cases of usage, the J2 Core did die down on us before the end of the day.In our 15-minute battery tests that consisted of browsing, watching video and playing games, the J2 Core's battery dipped down only 1-2% which is a good score.VerdictWith the J2 Core, Samsung has tried to focus on getting the basics right with some added functionalities. Display and cameras are the two areas where Samsung needs to work, for phones launching in this segment. Though, the full picture isn't all grim looking and due to the system level optimization that comes with Android 8.1 Oreo (Go Edition) along with the refreshing design and the snappy performance, the J2 Core is a cool new option for first-time smartphone buyers. While the J2 Core wouldn’t please a user who has used a smartphone before, it will surely attract first-time smartphone buyers. For everyone else, you may want to look at some of the offerings by competition, such as the Xiaomi Redmi 6A which retails at ₹5,999 and looks like a better composition of hardware specifications on paper. Still, Samsung should be your choice if after sales support and service is a major concern.Also Read: Samsung Galaxy Note 9 review"
"bngXxHZotwLXb4JJubMYpF~Samsung Galaxy Note 9 review~https://www.techradar.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-note-9-india~ ~ ~ ~While many would says it's not new, the Galaxy Note 9 defies the fact in every department if not design. It's quite evidently an incremental upgrade over last year's Note 8 with a bigger display, better display, more power and enhanced cameras. But all that comes with an expensive price tag as well. It's the biggest Android phone that's turning heads in 2018, with a sizeable 6.4-inch AMOLED panel, a massive 4000mAh battery and up to 512GB internal storage with 8GB of RAM. If that's not enough, Samsung provides additional support for microSD card of up to 1TB.While the display size is increased over Note 8's 6.3-inch, the good news is that it doesn't feel any bigger in hand. Which gets even better with all the new features from their siblings— Galaxy S9 and S9 Plus. The camera, very clearly, better than the Note 8, with a dual 12MP rear setup that has dual-aperture technology, and can record Super Slow Mo videos. There are stereo speakers, and AR Emoji is back with some finer avatar customisations, but rest assured, it'll still look nothing like you.In addition to the existing camera features, the Note 9 camera has some exclusives including an automatic scene optimizer and flaw detection features to enhance pictures. From what we've seen, Samsung has a record of rolling out the exclusive features to older devices later on. Samsung Galaxy Note's most supreme attraction has always been its S Pen. This time as well, the stylus gets an upgrade with a low-frequency Bluetooth for customisable remote-controlled shortcuts. So, if you wish to click a shot of yourself from 30 meters away, this S Pen can help you do that. Taking full body snapshots have become quite effortless, given you find a neat and safe place to place your precious and expensive Note 9. Of course, you need to envision the frame in advance to get a better shot as we failed to find the right angles to get the best results using the S Pen. Check out our hands-on video below to see the Galaxy Note 9 in action:Samsung Galaxy Note 9 release date and priceRelease date is August 22, up on saleRs 67,900 for 128GB/6GBRs 84,900 for 512GB/8GBThe Samsung Galaxy Note 9 released on Friday, August 22, sooner than anyone had expected a year ago. The Note 8 came out on September 15 in India last year. Talking of Samsung's chief competition, the Note 9 price rivals that of Apple’s flagship handset iPhone X. While the phone is priced high in UK and the US, in India, the Note 9 undercuts the iPhone X by approximately Rs 20,000 and has double the storage. The Galaxy Note 9 colors in the India are Ocean Blue with a yellow S Pen (it also writes in yellow for the ultimate color contrast), Metallic Copper and and Midnight Black. New S Pen tricksBluetooth stylus has custom shortcutsGreat for remotely taking photos, works up to 30 feet awayCharges quickly while embedded in the phoneNormal note-taking works even when unchargedSamsung Galaxy Note 9 has always sold their S Pen as the key feature of the lineup, and this time it's no different. The new S Pen arrives in yellow colour in the blue variant and it's capable of doing much more than just sketching or writing.Samsung's engineers managed to squeeze a small supercapacitor and tiny Bluetooth Low-Energy antenna into the otherwise unchanged stylus so that it can perform various remote functions. It’s the type of gimmick we ended up liking – sometimes. So what's exactly new here? The most useful and interesting feature this time is the remote control feature, which enable users to remotely launch the camera app with a long press of the button in the centre, flip the camera to selfies mode with a single short press, and snap a group photo with two presses. It's easier than any other alternative that's seen on a smartphone camera. It's easier to use than the timer or the palm gesture.Samsung is making S Pen shortcuts customizable. Here are the ideas mentioned:Camera: Flip the camera / take a photoCamera: Flip the camera / record a videoMusic Player: Play and pause music / skip to the next track Photo Gallery: Advance to the next photo / cycle back to a previous photoPowerPoint: back and forth through presentation slidesSamsung put a software development kit (SDK) out there for non-core third-party apps to take advantage of this shortcut tool, so you'll see more customization as long as app developers support the functionality. The S Pen does need to be charged, but it requires only 40 seconds of charge time for 30 minutes of standby battery life or 200 button clicks, according to our testing.There's also a helpful S Pen battery indicator in the notification shade at the top of the display, so you won't be kept guessing as to how much power you have left. And we found that keeping the S Pen topped up was much easier than charging the iPad's Apple Pencil. Simply embedding the S Pen inside the phone charges it, and when it’s not in use that’s where you typically put it. The Apple Pencil has nowhere to hide, and walking around with it in the Lighting port is rather dangerous. Samsung’s years of stylus-making experience are obvious here.Image 1 of 3Draw the S Pen out of the Note 9 when the screen is off and you'll launch on-screen memoImage 2 of 3The color of the S Pen ink is the same as the color of the stylus itselfImage 3 of 3The Ocean Blue Note 9 has the more dynamic yellow S Pen for a nice contrast. It writes in yellow digital ink. All the of them support the same Air Commands and do everything that the S Pen on the Note 8 can do. If we look at the core target customers for the Note 9, they are the enterprise users. For them, the S Pen does come handy while running a PowerPoint presentation and using the S Pen as the clicker. Of course, the off screen memo feature is something that benefits everyone.

Like previous 'Premium' phones it has a 4K screen and Sony crams more pixels into 5.8 inches than some TVs do into 50.A super-sharp screen isn't the main event this time, though. Night photography is.The Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium has comfortably the best camera used in an Xperia phone to date. It can take almost strangely good night photos considering it does not have optical image stabilization.However, it still can’t topple the Huawei P20 Pro at night. And the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium is otherwise tricky to recommend. It’s big and heavy without any obvious excuse, and parts of the design are awkward and a little dated.If you find the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium as part of a low-price deal it’s still a solid buy. Its tech and performance are good. But there are too many better alternatives out there to fully recommend it at full price.Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium price and availabilityOut now in the US, hits UK on August 31Costs $999/£799Sony announced the Xperia XZ2 Premium in April 2018, before it went on sale at the end of July. It took a little longer to reach the UK, though, with it arriving on August 31.In the US the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium price is $999, comparable with the iPhone X, Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus and Samsung Galaxy Note 9. However, UK buyers get a slightly better deal. At £799 the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium is a little cheaper than all those high-profile rivals. Currently it's not available in Australia.The wider context is worth considering too, though. Those after a slick phone with high-end specs should also check out the OnePlus 6 ($529, £469) and Huawei P20 (£499, AU$899), which are as powerful but cost significantly less.Thanks to the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium’s relatively late arrival even the Huawei P20 Pro is now available for less than the Sony.Key featuresHigh-end specs at a high-end priceDual rear camerasSnapdragon 845 chipsetThe Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium is an unusual phone. It’s one of the few 2018 models to use an old-style 16:9 screen rather than an 18:9 one.This immediately dates the look, and makes it feel far larger than other phones with a similar screen inch count. However, it’s also the only high profile 2018 flagship with a 4K screen. Samsung, Apple and LG don’t make 4K phones at the moment.It’s a Sony USP. In person, though, its benefits are not particularly dramatic.The camera is a better draw. This is, remarkably, Sony’s first dual-rear camera phone. The Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium uses these cameras to great effect too, boosting low light performance.This phone has almost none of the image quality issues of old Sony Xperia phones. All options at this price are top performers, though, and the XZ2 Premium doesn’t slide ahead of the lot. It just sees Sony phones finally reach where they should be.Outside of these distinct areas, the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium has familiar specs. It uses the Snapdragon 845 chipset, seen in several top Androids of 2018, and a 3,540mAh battery with wireless charging.Storage comes with a slight sting. You get 64GB. At this price we’d like to see 128GB instead, although as the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium has a microSD card slot this probably shouldn’t put you off buying the phone.Design158 x 80 x 11.9mm, 236gGorilla Glass 5 rear, aluminum sidesIP68 water resistanceThe Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium is the stubby, tubby king of Android phones. Sony has ignored several recent design trends, and we end up with something quite different to the rest.But not in an entirely positive sense.The Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium doesn’t have an ultra-slim screen surround, and is very wide and thick. 11.9mm at its middle, it heads towards twice the thickness of an iPhone X.At 80mm wide, it also feels larger than the 76.4mm Galaxy Note 9. Add its hefty 236g weight and the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium starts to look like a mammoth.There’s no obvious reason either. This phone does not have a gigantic battery or military spec ruggedization. It’s just unusually thick and heavy.Screen shape is what makes it seem immediately dated. Just about every other phone around the price has an 18:9 or 18.5:9 screen. These displays are longer and taller than the Sony’s, used to fill more of the front with display.Big borders above and below the screen make the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium look stout. Put the Sony next to the other $1000 phones and re-imagine them as the school kid cast of an 80s adventure film. The Sony definitely plays the part of the ‘fat’ kid.Still, the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium is an immediately eye-catching phone. Its back is a smoothly curved piece of Gorilla Glass 5, the sides shiny, rounded aluminum. It feels expensive, and the curvature of the glass ensures it doesn’t seem as thick as its 11.8mm spec sounds.Some have complained about how the XZ2 Premium’s smooth glass rear makes it slip all over the place. Maybe our desks are too flat, our hands not smooth enough, but we haven’t found it an issue.The Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium’s power button and fingerprint scanner placement are odd, though. When the Xperia Z series began in 2013, Sony introduced its ‘OmniBalance’ design. Its core tenet is ‘put stuff in the middle’, expressed in a more flowery manner.It’s used here, far too literally. The fingerprint sits in the middle of the XZ2 Premium’s back, and it’s far too low. Your finger wants it to be where the camera sits. Making a ‘convenience’ feature like a fingerprint scanner less convenient makes it, you guessed it, worse.The power button on the side is also a little low, but only by a centimeter, not two inches like the scanner.Like a lot of past Xperia phones, the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium is water resistant. It’s certified to IP65/68, meaning it can handle being submerged in water and pelted with water jets. Sony asks you not to test this, mind:“You should not put the device completely underwater; or expose it to seawater, salt water, chlorinated water, or liquids such as drinks. Abuse and improper use of device will invalidate warranty,” Sony writes on its website.There’s also no headphone jack. You get an adaptor in the box, but we’d much rather see a 3.5mm socket.Sony’s Xperia XZ2 Premium is an awkward phone. It’s big and heavy, and its screen shape belongs in 2016, not 2018. You’ll get used to all its odd design elements, but at this price we don’t think we should have to.Screen5.8-inch 3840 x 2160 Triluminos LCD screen16:9 aspect ratio4K HDR video supportWhen you look at the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium’s screen spec, you have to consider more than the numbers. This is a 5.8-inch LCD screen. However, thanks to its 16:9 shape it’s actually as wide as another phone with a display measuring well over six inches.This is a big-screen phone. Just as we saw when looking at the design, that this screen shape looks dated is a key issue. And it does not make good use of the phone’s footprint. There’s a lot of blank space above and below the display. It doesn’t have a front fingerprint scanner or larger front speakers to excuse the ‘wasted’ space either.Widescreen moans out of the way, the Sony Xperia XZ2 Premium’s display is otherwise excellent.It’s super-vivid, rich and sharp. Pixel density of 765 pixels per inch is almost ridiculous. The Galaxy Note 9 offers 516ppi, and we’re well beyond the point of diminishing returns here. You can’t really even tell whether the phone renders Android at 4K or, like the last Premium phone, drops down to 1080p most of the time.The most obvious benefit is for VR, as even if the games/apps aren’t rendered at 4K, high pixel density still lowers the ‘screen door’ effect, where you can discern the little gaps between pixels. However, VR remains a niche curiosity for most people.Like the top Samsung phones, Sony lets you choose how vivid you want the XZ2 Premium screen to look. There’s a ‘Professional’ mode that calibrates to the sRGB gamut, a ‘standard’ mode that offers the slightly punched-up tones most people want and Super-Vivid, which maxes-out the abilities of the Triluminos screen.The XZ2 Premium also supports HDR. This means you can watch HDR content in apps like YouTube and Netflix."
"eSLBZhFCWywwHmLXu7BbSG~Hands on: Xiaomi Mi A2 review~https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xiaomi-mi-a2~ ~ ~ ~Xiaomi’s first big launch since the IPO is a phone that’s known for not having the company’s core identity. The Xiaomi Mi A2 is an Android One device that sports stock-like Android software, miles apart from Xiaomi’s usual MiUI implementation, a software the company really banks on to engage its community.When it launched the Mi A1 last year, the company’s tryst with stock Android software was an experiment, but having seen unprecedented success with that device, the phone is now part of Xiaomi’s yearly cycle. Hence, the Mi A2 is an update over its predecessor, and brings a healthy mix of Google and Xiaomi in one phone.Price and availabilityThe Mi A2 launches in Spain immediately, at €249 for the 4GB/32GB variant and €279 for the 4/64GB variant and €349 for the 6/128GB version. The phone lands in India on 8 August, but only the 4/64GB variant is expected to be sold in the country.There’s a Mi A2 Lite as well, which is being sold at €179 for the 3/32GB version and €229 for the 4/64GB variant. While the company has announced this phone already, it’s availability in all of Xiaomi’s markets is yet to be confirmed.What’s newThe primary changes this year include a larger 5.9-inch FHD+ display, a new dual-camera combination on the back and a higher resolution front camera. The Mi A2 omits the telephoto lens from last year, in favour of a 20MP+12MP setup. So, the camera doesn’t have fancy optical zooming capabilities, but it still shoots portrait shots. In fact, Xiaomi says its software will intelligently choose which sensor to use when you’re shooting photos in portrait mode.There’s also a sizeable update in terms of processing power, but perhaps not enough to ditch your Mi A1 just yet. The Snapdragon 660 takes a page out of Qualcomm’s flagship chipset (the 845), replacing ARM’s Cortex A53 cores with custom Kryo 260 cores. That should give a good boost in terms of processing speeds, at least on paper. You can expect higher benchmark scores compared to the Mi A1.Xiaomi is also quite confident about the camera this time and suggests that it will be comparable to the OnePlus 6, which is quite a claim to make. While it’s too early to take a call on this, things are looking up after the first few shots. The camera app here is the only noticeable change to Google’s stock Android software.The Mi A2 still comes with a two-year update promise, meaning it will definitely get the Android P and Android Q updates in future. At the moment, the phone runs Android 8.1 Oreo out of the box.DesignWhile the Xiaomi Mi A2 retains the general look of the Mi A2, there’s a noticeable change in its identity. For one, the phone feels wider, meaning it’s not as ergonomic as its predecessor. The “hand feel” isn’t of a compact phone and lies closer to that of a phablet. It’s also slimmer and has the full metal build like last time.The two cameras are placed vertically on the top left on the back, with a noticeable bulge. You’ll find the fingerprint sensor below it, at the centre of the rear panel.While the design has changed a bit, this looks more old school amongst a sea of notch-riddled, full screen smartphones today. The Mi A2 is not a big screen phone with a small overall footprint. And that might actually work against Xiaomi at this point.Early verdictIn Xiaomi’s core markets, like India and China, the Mi A2 might be the only notch-free device that anyone will care about. The company’s decision to make a stock Android device paid off last time and the phone has entered the yearly grind. The Mi A2 is an update over its predecessor, so it’s not expected to replace your Mi A1. However, it gives Xiaomi a shot at user acquisition, by getting customers who aren’t too fond of the company’s own software. In the long run, the Mi A2 would likely be one of Xiaomi’s many phones only, but it keeps the company relevant and grinding.Particularly in India, the Mi A2 might be very important to Xiaomi’s cause. Since the company will hike the pricing this time, the Mi A2 will be sold at a price tier that Xiaomi has often failed to capture. In that, mid-ranged bracket, the Mi A2 will be a cheaper alternative to the Nokia 7 Plus, and on first impressions, Nokia is in for a tough battle.Comparison: Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro vs Mi A1"
"S6SKPFBr4pBRmXFwNHhouF~Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 review~https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xiaomi-mi-mix-3-review~ ~ ~ ~The Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 is a striking smartphone, with an all-screen display that shuns the notch and 'punch-hole' design culture currently sweeping the industry in favor of a cleaner, smarter look.Now, you might be wondering, if there’s an all-screen display, but no notch, and no punch-hole, where’s the selfie camera? The answer is that Xiaomi has dusted off a smartphone design trick from way back when, with the display sliding down to expose the Mi Mix 3’s front-facing snapper.It’s a trick Xiaomi has pulled off to good effect, and it means the Mi Mix 3 earns a prominent entry in the annals of the smartphone industry’s quest for a 100% screen-to-body ratio, with Xiaomi managing to fill 93.4% of the phone’s front-facing body with screen.Sliding display aside, the Mi Mix 3 boasts a host of high-end features, and with a price tag that sees it compete directly with ‘affordable flagships’ such as the OnePlus 6T and Honor View 20. Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 price and availabilityThe Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 is available in the UK, China and a host European and Asian countries, but the brand is yet to launch its smartphones in the US. Xiaomi only arrived in the UK at the end of 2018, so there’s hope it will bring its phones to the US soon.The firm’s phones are available in Australia and India, although the Mi Mix 3 is yet to reach either - but keep an eye out for it as it may be arriving soon.The Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 price is £499 (around £650, AU$900) in the UK, which as we’ve mentioned puts it up against the the OnePlus 6T and Honor View 20, while comfortably undercutting the established names.There is a Mi Mix 3 variant with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but we’ve been told that it won’t be coming to the UK.Design and displayThe big feature of the Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 is its sliding screen, which you have to tug with a little force to get the magnetic mechanism to move down and click into place.It is something of a party piece. We handed the Mi Mix 3 to many of our friends and family, and they were impressed with the all-screen display, but stumped when we challenged them to find the front-facing camera. When we slid the screen down to reveal it, everyone had the same reaction: “That’s cool.”It also makes a satisfying ‘clunk’ as you slide it up and down, which initially saw us playing with the slider subconsciously as we held the device, but we stopped doing so shortly into our review period – because the Mi Mix 3 isn’t actually that easy to slide.The screen is held in position by magnets to prevent accidental slides, but we found these to be a little too strong. Coupled with the slippery glass finish and a heavy body, it means you need to apply quite a lot of pressure to the screen in order to slide the Mi Mix 3 open.Compared to the BlackBerry Priv – one of the few sliding phones to launch in the past four years – the Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 just isn’t as smooth.Sure it’s cool, and the Mi Mix 3 can boast a form factor that helps it stand out from the crowd of slabs, and will potentially make it the envy of your friends, but day to day we found that we hardly used the slider.Unless we wanted to snap a gratuitous selfie, the screen remained unmoved. You can use the sliding action to answer calls, but it’s a bit of a gimmick and an on-screen swipe tends to be easier if you’re using the phone one-handed. It can be popped down to use the camera for face unlock, but considering the Mi Mix 3 has a rear fingerprint scanner which is easier and quicker to use, that function seems a little redundant.                                              And the sliding design choice does come with a few drawbacks. The Mi Mix 3 is noticeably heavier than other phones, at 218g, and it’s slightly thicker (8.5mm) than most of its rivals, although it’s still slim enough to fit in your pocket. It's too early to tell if the sliding mechanism will wear out after prolonged use over the phone's lifespan, but we experienced no issues with the movement during our time with the handset. We did find that the section of phone which is uncovered when you slide down is a dust trap though, so a regular wipe is required to keep things looking fresh.Xiaomi has confirmed that the Mi Mix 3 does not have an IP rating for water or dust resistance, and the sliding mechanism puts its weather-proofing credentials even further in doubt.Another issue with the sliding design is protection. A slim case is provided in the box with the Mi Mix 3, but it doesn’t cover the base of the phone, and leaves the chin which slides out exposed if you were to drop the handset. You'll have to be extra careful if you do decide to pick it up.As is the trend with flagships these days, there’s no 3.5mm headphone jack on the Mi Mix 3, with just a USB-C port and speaker grilles on the base of the phone. On the right you'll find a power/lock key below a volume rocker, both of which are easy to hit.There is a third physical button though, located on the left of the handset just below the SIM card tray. This key launches Google's Assistant when pressed, giving you quick access to voice commands.The relatively large size of the phone means it's a little unwieldy when trying to type one-handed, with two hands often required if you're tapping out more than just a few words.Having a large, completely uninterrupted screen really feels like a luxury, though, and the 6.39-inch Full HD+ (2340 x 1080) AMOLED display on the Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 is all the better without any notches or punch-holes getting in the way.However, it doesn’t quite have the same punchy contrast of the AMOLED displays on Samsung and OnePlus handsets. It means colors appear a little more muted on the Mi Mix 3, which can make some images look a little more natural, but when it comes to watching video and playing games we’d have liked a little more pop.Xiaomi Mi Mix 3 hands on galleryImage 1 of 7Image 2 of 7Image 3 of 7Image 4 of 7Image 5 of 7Image 6 of 7Image 7 of 7"
"UxBWz32PDReo9WDm3vwMJo~Hands on: Xiaomi Redmi 6A review~https://www.techradar.com/reviews/xiaomi-redmi-6a~ ~ ~ ~Xiaomi may make phones with in-display fingerprint scanners now, but it also has super cheap phones, too. The latest of the them is the Xiaomi Redmi 6A which has a lack of thrilling features, but that doesn't really matter considering how much it costs.We've had time to try out the Xiaomi Redmi 6A at the London launch of the brand, and you'll find our first impressions of the phone below.Xiaomi Redmi 6A price and release dateYou're able to buy the Xiaomi Redmi 6A in the UK from November 9 and the phone is exclusive to Three's network. Or you can buy it from some third-party retailers for £99.You can buy the Xiaomi Redmi 6A in India too with the price starting at Rs 5,999. You've actually been able to buy it in India since it launched in June 2018, though there's no clear plan for Xiaomi to bring the phone to the US or Australia.Design and displayImage 1 of 2Image 2 of 2The Xiaomi Redmi 6A is an affordable phone, and you'll instantly recognize that as soon as you pick it up in your hand.Considering its price, we found the Xiaomi Redmi 6A to feel quite premium in hand, with a metal effect on the rear of the device that's brushed to make it feel that bit more authentic.It's a good looking device considering that price, and along the bottom you'll find the microUSB port for charging while the top edge features a 3.5mm headphone jack. The power button and volume rocker are easy to reach on the right hand side.We've seen the black edition in our short time with the phone, but the device also comes in light blue, pink and gold colors as well.The display is where things aren't as premium, but that's to be expected at this price. The Redmi 6A comes with a HD+ resolution display that's 5.45-inches.That means you'll get 295 pixels per inch, and while that may not sound great on paper, there are many phones on the market that cost more than this but offer the same or slightly worst screen quality.We found the display to be bright in our quick test, and it's a great size for those who don't want a gargantuan phone. The bezels are thick around the top and bottom of the phone, but it features an 18:9 aspect ratio that makes it feel a little different to some other budget devices too.Battery life and cameraWhile we can't offer a verdict on the battery life on the Redmi 6A, we can say we'd expect it to last a full day as it has a 3000mAh battery inside. Considering there's not much to power on this phone, we'd expect it to do well in day-to-day usage.We'll be sure to test that properly when it comes time for our full review.There's a 13MP rear camera on this phone with an aperture of f/2.2, and while it won't take the best shot for your Instagram it's quite respectable when compared to other phones around this price.We took a few photos in our testing time and time-to-focus proved a little slower than we would have hoped, but it's unlikely to be enough to really frustrate you.For selfies, you've got a basic 5MP front-facing camera with the same aperture as the rear. Again, this won't blow you away but it's also not the worst we've seen at this end of the market.Performance and interfaceWhen you're spending this much on a phone, you shouldn't expect the performance you'd likely get from a Xiaomi Mi 8 Pro.It's sporting a MediaTek Helio A22 chipset, and we've yet to use that properly in another device so we can't offer much insight on its overall performance, but it's toward the low end of the power spectrum.Impressively, you can get it paired with 3GB of RAM in one edition of the Redmi 6A, and while it won't be able to run all of your mobile games at top spec it's sure to be able to run most of your apps. It may just take a little longer than you'd hope for them to load.There's a 2GB RAM version of the phone too that comes with 16GB of storage, while the 3GB sports 32GB. We'd advise not to go for a 16GB phone at all, as that's unlikely to be enough space for all of your apps and anything else you want to upload.It's currently not clear what version of the phone Xiaomi will be bringing to the UK.In terms of interface, the Redmi 6A comes with Android 8.1 software installed, so it's relatively new, and it has Xiaomi's own interface over the top of it.It looks good, but it's a different appearance to a lot of other phones on the market right now, so it may take you some time to get properly used to it when you first boot up the device.Early verdictThe Xiaomi Redmi 6A isn't going to floor you with its performance or features, but everything here seems to work well.Considering the price, you'll likely be happy with what the Redmia 6A can do and it keeps pace with other budget alternatives."
