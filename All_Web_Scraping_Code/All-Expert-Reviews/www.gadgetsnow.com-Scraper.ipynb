      " Updated: Oct 25, 2018, 10:02AM IST\n",
      " If there’s one brand that has been in an overdrive when it comes to launching smartphones, then it is Honor. So much so that Huawei’s sub-brand has achieved a good amount of traction in the Indian smartphone market over last one year. The firm is giving a stiff competition to Xiaomi and Samsung in the budget and mid-range segments. Out of all the Honor smartphone series that exist in the country, the Honor ‘X’ series has probably been one of the most popular ones in the market and with the new-launched Honor 8X, it is quite clear that the firm wants to continue the streak. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honor 8X is the latest in the ‘X’ line of smartphone that has always been catering to the sub-Rs 20,000 market. With the increasing competition in the particular bracket, it was only expected from Honor to launch the 8X that has some new features and a more powerful set of specs under the hood as compared to some Chinese players. Launched last week, you can get the Honor 8X in three variants based on storage and RAM and two variants based on the colour. \n",
      "These are the variants and their prices: \n",
      "\n",
      "-4GB RAM+64GB storage (Rs 14,999) \n",
      "-6GB RAM+64GB storage (Rs 16,999) \n",
      "-6GB RAM+128GB storage (Rs 18,999) \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We used the base model (4GB RAM + 64GB storage) as this is the most affordable in the 8X lineup and most likely to get buyers given the buying behaviour in the Indian smartphone market The smartphone also comes in Blue and Black colour versions. There’s also a Red colour variant that will arrive later \n",
      "\n",
      "So what’s the deal with Honor 8X? At a base price of Rs 14,999 is it a worthy competitor to the likes of \n",
      "Xiaomi Mi A2, \n",
      "Nokia 6.1 Plus or other such handsets? We used it for a while and here’s what it boils down to. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honor 8X Design \n",
      "\n",
      "Honor 8X is a refreshing change from the previous X-series smartphones from the brand. This time it’s more premium-looking using the same metal and glass build. What’s the first change you may see is the dual-tone look at the back. Both the design tones are glossy but with a different shade that looks good for a smartphone priced at Rs 14,999. Honor says it has achieved this look using multiple layers of glass. However, since the entire back is glass coated, it attracts fingerprints and may be damaged as well if dropped from a height. However, the overall build seems sturdy. \n",
      "\n",
      "What adds to the look is the front side that now has a larger screen estate. The sides have brushed metal look with volume and power buttons on the right side and the SIM card supporting slot on the left. At the bottom you have a 3.5mm headphone jack and a speaker grille along with a micro-USB port in the middle. You can also see the antenna strips at the bottom and towards the top on right and left side. \n",
      "\n",
      "The company said that it went for the older micro-USB port as it wanted to keep the price of the handset down. Including a Type-C port could’ve resulted in a slight increase in Honor 8X’s cost. \n",
      "There’s no Honor logo at the front though. It has been moved to the lower back side towards the left along with ‘AI camera’ written below the vertically placed dual cameras on the top-left side are all from the landscape point of view, something similar to what we have seen in flagship Huawei smartphones. The device is also being touted for the camera among other features and this design emphasises on it even more. Also, both the cameras have individual bumps but is not wobbly to operate when kept flat on a hard surface. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honor 8X however, is not made for single-handed usage as it is broader than others in the segment. But the looks will most likely make you forget about it. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Honor 8X Display \n",
      "\n",
      "Honor 8X’s display is not the best but it’s still worth the appreciation. At Rs 14,999 you are getting a 6.5-inch FullView IPS LCD display with FHD+ (1080x2340 pixels) resolution, giving a 91% screen to body ratio, which is difficult to find in smartphones coming at this price range. The screen is immersive enough and fortunately the notch is not a distraction here. \n",
      "\n",
      "The notch is one of the most compact ones we have seen lately. Like others, it comprises of the ambient and proximity sensor, a circular speaker grille and a front-facing camera. It is short in both length and width, giving more space for the system and app icons on either side of the screen. All this comes in addition to a thinner chin at the bottom of the screen. It still exists though and you can clearly see it but it’s again one of the slimmest ones in the segment. So, thumbs up on that front. \n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally, you cannot expect an AMOLED-grade saturation and overall quality here but it still is good to look at. It gets bright enough so you don’t have to struggle or change angles to view the content on the screen in bright daylight conditions. The colours are vibrant and have a certain amount of ‘punchiness’ to them. Streaming shows in Netflix shouldn’t be an issue with this one or playing games for that matter. The panel also plays well with the colour tones when viewed from different angles. There’s hardly a noticeable change there. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the software side of things, you get a bunch of features including the ability to customise the colour tone and the temperature of the display, Blue light filter and allowing apps to show content in full view (including the area covered by the notch). \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Honor 8X PerformanceIn our daily usage, the Honor 8X hardly gave us a chance to complain about its performance. The smartphone offers fluid performance and a major part of the credit goes to the HiSilicon 710 processor. The animation rendering and operating on multiple apps shouldn’t be an issue with the handset. The processor is said to compete with the likes of Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 and the Snapdragon 636, which are also reasonably good chipsets for budget or mid-range handsets. \n",
      "\n",
      "Although the unit we received includes 4GB RAM, having a 6GB RAM won’t bring a major change upfront though but it sure is powerful enough to handle more apps easily. Average usage including light multi-tasking is handled well and the UI is easy to get used to. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Honor’s EMUI has seen subtle changes over past couple of years and has the one running in Honor 8X (EMUI 8.2 based on Android 8.1 Oreo) is as refined as it gets for now. You get several customisation options under the ‘Settings’ app and the entire interface is pretty straightforward without much unwanted cramped features. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, it was a pleasant experience for us with the Honor 8X. It can handle most of the tasks that you do on a day to day basis and is clutter free. It’s not as clean as the one found in Nokia smartphones, which essentially is stock Android. As for the OS updates, Honor is yet to reach a level where it gets OS upgrades as quickly as the ones running stock Android. Nonetheless, the unit we reviewed runs September security patch. \n",
      "\n",
      "What adds to it is the GPU Turbo tech that essentially boosts the performance of the games on the smartphone. This works in tandem with the powerful yet less power consuming HiSilicon 710 processor. \n",
      "\n",
      "The 64GB inbuilt storage may not be enough for most of us but fortunately, Honor is giving the ability to expand the inbuilt storage up to 400GB via microSD card, which takes a separate, third slot in the same dual SIM card tray. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Honor 8X Camera \n",
      "Camera is one of the highlights of the Honor 8X smartphone. The firm is touting the dual rear cameras of the device that come with powerful specs and deliver a decent image and video performance. In our daily usage we found the night shots in particular better than others. What powers the device’s camera section are two rear cameras with a dedicated 2MP depth sensor along with a 20MP primary sensor. Both are said to sport f/1.8 aperture along with a bunch of modes that are powered by the AI prowess worked upon by the firm to bring out the best shot. \n",
      "\n",
      "The AI feature is not switched on by default but the option is right there on the main camera screen at the top. In daylight usage, the feature essentially boosts the colours of the subject most of the times and makes the overall shot tad bit sharper. In low-light it optimises most of the shots closest to what it looks like in real life. As compared to a regular-clicked shot, the AI-based one loses a bit of brightness but tries to retain the near-original colour. Also, the shutter takes a second after the shot is taken, particularly to sharpen the image. This could be annoying at times but the end results do look good. \n",
      "\n",
      "Honor claims that the AI tech in camera can optimise the image based on 22 shot categories, which includes nearly everything from a dedicated mode to click pets, portraits, nature, beaches, architecture and more. For low light shots you can also go for the dedicated Night mode, which takes even more time to click a shot and in a lower resolution but eliminates shaky shots, delivering a stable shot as the end result. Nonetheless, customisation options are ample. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The overall camera quality however, is good like it has been for all the recent Honor smartphones that have launched in the particular segment. The video shooting quality is also decent and should work for most of us. You cannot shoot 4K videos with this one but you still get the next best option – full HD at 60fps. You also get to chose the video format between H.265 (that takes less space) or H.264. Slow motion video recording is also workable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The front-facing camera of the Honor 8X boasts of a 16MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture, which is not bad but also not best when it comes to taking natural-looking selfies. The bokeh mode still needs a lot of work. It however, does recognise the subject spot-on. A lot of this has to do with the post processing and we hope Honor gets it right at the next attempt. \n",
      "\n",
      "You also get backlight portrait selfie feature, something that is similar to what is there in the iPhones. It is good for those who want to go creative in their selfie shots but is yet to reach there. Nonetheless, the 16MP camera does capture details and colours, making the shot look vivid. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Honor 8X Battery \n",
      "Honor 8X gets a thumbs up from our side in the battery department. The smartphone runs for almost 8-9 hours on average usage. This includes everything from playing for an hour to streaming music, using the camera for some time and even editing documents, all which staying connected to Wi-Fi or 4G network. \n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth adding here that Honor smartphones, although not really known for their battery performance, have always proved to be worth it handsets. The Honor 8X has a 3750mAh battery, which is not usual in smartphone in the particular price segment. The ample battery, although makes it slightly heavy, it does make sure you get long hours of usage. This is after the smartphone powering a 6.5-inch screen with around 400ppi and FHD+ resolution. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The 3750mAh battery when clubbed with a 6.5-inch display and a HiSilicon 710 processor should deliver around 5 hours of screen on time. What’s good news here is that the device comes with a bundled 10W charger (5V/2A). You also get the usual software-based features to save battery. This includes the Power Saving mode and the Ultra Power Saving mode, both of which essentially restricts background app processing along with animations and even drops the brightness of the screen with a monochrome interface. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict \n",
      "Honor 8X has its own set of pros and cons like any other handset but if you look at the overall set of specifications and the performance it delivers in different departments, it is one of the most competitive handsets in the market. It has a good display that is immersive and some nifty features such as triple card slot also comes as an addition if nothing else. The battery performance is also good. As for the design, it is one of the most good-looking devices in the sub-Rs 20,000 segment. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you want a stock Android handset, this is nowhere in the list but it manages to outshine others in different departments. Its track record in terms of OS updates is also not a good one. But if these factors are something you can ignore, the handset definitely ups the bar for other devices coming from Nokia and Xiaomi.\n",

      " Updated: Oct 31, 2017, 06:32PM IST\n",
      " The camera in a smartphone has become a deciding factor for most customers. When earlier this month, Honor launched a smartphone with four cameras, it was obvious that it would catch the fancy of “camera conscious” customers. Is the four-camera equipped Honor 9i only about the cameras or does it have what it takes to get a march on the competition? We spent a few days with the smartphone and read the rest of our review to find out the answer to the above question:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Design\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thing that you will notice about the design and build quality of Honor 9i is that it looks more premium than other smartphones in the same range. The credit for it goes entire to the aluminium body that’s coupled with the matte finish. It’s fair to say that the smartphone has top-notch build quality and excels in the look and feel factor. What adds gloss to the design is the fact that one-handed usage of the device is extremely easy. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The front of the device is dominated by the 5.9-inch IPS LCD display, which comes with slimmer bezels and on-screen navigation keys that only appear when one touches the screen. The slimmer bezels add to the premium look of the smartphone. Right above the display lies the dual selfie cameras. Flip the smartphone over and you’ll see the dual rear cameras along with LED flash. The fingerprint sensor lies just below it and at the bottom lies the Honor branding. The right edge has the power and volume rocker buttons and the left edge has the SIM tray. The 3.5mm jack, microUSB slot and the speaker grilles are all on the bottom edge.\n",
      "\n",
      "The minimalistic design of the 9i works quite well and if you like your smartphone to be chunkier then this isn’t the right choice for you. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the design of the smartphone worked wonders then the display isn’t far behind. The Honor 9i has a beautiful display and it’s a treat to watch videos or browse photographs on the smartphone. The Honor 9i’s 5.9-inch IPS LCD display with 18:9 aspect ratio – which we mentioned earlier – has a lot going for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The colours look bright and vibrant, but not saturated. And if you don’t like the default colours being showcased on the display, you can choose from warmer or cooler tones. The colour reproduction was accurate and they don’t change even when viewed from different angles. However, sunlight readability was one aspect of the display that could have been better. Overall, the minimalistic design coupled with a beautiful display really impressed us. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "Honor 9i smartphone is powered by an octa-core Kirin 659 processor. It packs 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage. The smartphone runs Android 7.0 Nougat skinned with the company's own EMUI 5.1. However, there is no word on whether the smartphone will be getting an Android Oreo update. The Honor 9i smartphone houses a 3340mAh battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "On paper, all the specifications sound really impressive and we’ve to admit that after using the phone for a while, it’s safe to say that it lives up to what it promises. Most routine tasks were handles with consummate ease by the smartphone. Before getting into the performance details, let’s talk about the software on board. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Honor 9i runs Android 7.0 Nougat skinned with the company's own EMUI 5.1 and comes with quite a few tweaks. For instance, the notification panel is different from what it is in other Android smartphones. The app icons are also different and the app drawer of the smartphone is integrated with the home screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "While launching various apps on the smartphone there weren’t any noticeable lags and even switching between apps wasn’t an issue. Even while using multiple tabs of Chrome, there was absolutely no problem. Honor 9i handles multitasking quite seamlessly. \n",
      "\n",
      "Be it playing music while using navigation or playing games the device coped with multitasking easily. You can browse the Internet or use social media apps like Facebook and Instagram, there won’t be any issue with the smartphone’s performance. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The cell phone reception was good most of the times, even in areas like elevators. Another plus was the fingerprint sensor of the smartphone as it was very quick in unlocking the phone, even with moist fingers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The one aspect where the smartphone falters is gaming. The smartphone does warm up slightly even while playing “simple” games like Temple Run 2 and Angry Birds. Having said that, this isn’t what can be termed as a heating issue. \n",
      "\n",

      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "The battery of the smartphone is another aspect where the smartphone scores highly. On what can be called heavy usage – social media, browsing internet, watching videos, listening to music – the smartphone’s batter lasted an entire day. It’s another feather in the Honor 9i’s cap. \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s talk about the USP of the device: The four cameras. It comes with 16MP+2MP rear cameras and 13MP+2MP front facing cameras. In both the cases, the secondary camera is for Bokeh effect. The cameras also have a feature called smart selfie toning flash. According to Honor, the feature automatically adjusts the brightness level as per the surroundings. Users can also click images first and focus later.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Most of the images that we clicked using all the four cameras came out quite well. The images taken in daylight or even well-lit indoor areas turned out to be really good. There wasn’t any noticeable pixilation and the colours were accurate. While viewing images on the laptop, the quality didn’t deteriorate. In lowly lit areas, there is a drop in the image quality but even then they were satisfactory. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bokeh effect of the both the cameras was good and we liked that fact that it can be adjusted. The camera app of the smartphone also comes with a Portrait mode and a Moving Picture mode. The latter is a functionality that enables the user to click GIF like images.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the 13MP selfie camera also did a good job and mostly clicked good pictures. It comes with a Beauty mode that can be adjusted. You can click Moving Pictures with the front facing camera too. However, there was an inconsistency in the quality of images in well-lit and lowly lit areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also ran a few benchmark tests on the phone. It scored 912 and 3351 in single core and multi core score of Geekbench 4 test and 64050 in Antutu.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VerdictFor a smartphone priced at Rs 17,999, Honor 9i comes with good specifications and its performance surely matched our expectations. This is what can be called an all-rounder of a smartphone. The Honor 9i has a great design and a beautiful display. To support the good looks is the smooth, solid performance and it has a camera that clicks really good images. There’s not much more that you can ask of a smartphone at this price point, can you? \n",

      "HTC Desire HTC 10 Pro doesn’t have a metal unibody construction like the Desire 10, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it looks bad. Yes, a metal unibody would have been great but the soft-touch polycarbonate material used in the Desire 10 Pro feels great in the hand. It has a matte finish and the metallic Gold lines add to the looks further. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Specifications\n",
      "\n",
      "Weighing about 165g, the HTC Desire 10 Pro sports a 5.5-inch Full HD display of 1080x1920 pixel resolution. It’s powered by a 1.8GHz octa-core MediaTek Helio P10 processor coupled with 3GB of RAM and 32GB of internal storage. There’s also a 4GB RAM variant with 64GB internal storage, and both support microSD cards of up to 2TB in size. \n",
      "\n",

The device has HTC’s BoomSound audio technology which only works on wired playback and is powered by a 3,000mAh battery. On the connectivity front, it supports 4G LTE, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and NFC.\n",

      "Performance and Camera\n",
      "\n",
      "No matter how good the design looks or how well a smartphone is priced, at the end it all comes down to performance. So is this mid-range smartphone capable of performing all the basic tasks? We’d say that the HTC Desire 10 Pro largely checks all the boxes in terms of design and general performance. During our benchmarking tests, the smartphone scored 730 in single-core performance and 2780 on multi-core one. On the other hand, the OnePlus 3T scores 1859 on single-core and 4339 on multi-core.\n",

      "\n",
      "We ran some heavy games and they worked perfectly fine. The display resolution is sharp and colours are vibrant. We didn’t experience any heating issues either, even when multi-tasking between various apps and windows. The speaker is loud enough but nothing too good. Also, the battery generally lasts a full day on a single charge with moderate usage.\n",
      "As for the call quality, we found it to be pretty decent in our testing. Obviously, this is something that depends on the network.\n",
      "\n",
      "What we found disappointing is that the default installed TouchPal keyboard isn’t that great. Although you can always download alternatives like Google Keyboard from the Play Store, it’s still a hassle and something that should work out-of-the-box. \n",

      " Only a few years back, you had to buy a flagship smartphone to get a great camera experience. But thanks to the advancements in technology and lowering hardware costs, that’s no longer the case. Today, even mid-range smartphones come with really capable cameras.\n",
      "\n",
      "With smartphone cameras already pushing the boundaries in terms of pixel count (among other features), the next popular trend among manufacturers seems to have become dual-camera smartphones. And the latest to join the bandwagon is Lenovo’s Phab 2 Plus. \n",
      "\n",
      "To differentiate it from the other dual-camera smartphones in the market, the \n",
      "Lenovo Phab 2 Plus is playing the budget-price card. Apart from all the ‘regular’ features, the phablet offers things like Augmented Reality camera effects, Dolby Atmos and a bit battery, all encased in a solidly built body.\n",
      "\n",
      "But even though all of it sounds really good, does it make the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus worth buying at the asking price of Rs 14,999? We reviewed the phablet for a few days, and here’s the rest of our review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Design and display\n",
      "Even though it has a pretty well-rounded design, the \n",
      "Lenovo Phab 2  Plus doesn’t offer anything that we haven’t already seen in other smartphones. It has a metallic unibody design with gently rounded corners and 2.5D curved glass front panel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having a massive 6.4-inch display, this is certainly not a smartphone built for one-handed use. However, the one-handed mode shifts the lockscreen and dialpad to one corner, making things a little better. The slightly curved back helps in making the phone’s grip better. But by all means, you are going to have a hard time finding a pocket big enough to stuff it in.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming to the sides, the right side is where the power button and volume rocker are. The left is home to a hybrid dual-SIM tray. A 3.5mm audio sits at the top, while the bottom is where the microUSB charging/data transfer port is.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The rear houses a dual-camera setup, along with a fingerprint sensor and Lenovo branding. We found the fingerprint sensor to be pretty responsive during our testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Above the display is an earpiece, a proximity sensor and a 5MP front-facing camera. There are three capacitive navigation keys below the display. However, they aren’t backlit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lenovo Phab 2  Plus has a large 6.4-inch Full HD display of 1080x1920 pixel resolution. The resulting pixel density of 344ppi, while not exactly the best, it’s more than decent.\n",
      "\n",
      "During our time with the device, we found the display to be really good. It produces vivid colours with a fair amount of accuracy. Viewing angles are good, and the screen is quite legible under direct sunlight. It’s possible to adjust the colour temperature and saturation in the phone’s settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus is a solid-looking phablet. And whether you love playing games or watching movies, it’s going to work just fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance and camera\n",
      "As a budget phablet, the Lenovo Phab 2 Plus offers fairly reasonable specifications, pretty much in line with what the competition. Under-the-hood, it’s powered by an octa-core MediaTek MT8783 processor paired with 3GB RAM. There’s 32GB of internal storage, expandable via microSD cards of up to 128GB in size. The phablet runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow with Lenovo’s Vibe UI skin baked on top.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the above mentioned one-handed mode, the Phab 2 Plus comes with many other ‘smart assist’ features like smart shortcuts, which lets users create a floating shortcut bar for quickly accessing utility-based apps. The phablet also has gesture controls and nifty smart calling features, such as the one which automatically lowers the ringing volume when the phone is picked and another which answers the call when the device is brought closer to the ear.\n",
      "\n",
      "Due to the built-in Dolby Atmos technology, we found the audio output from the Phab 2 Plus to be really loud and clear. The phablet comes with a Dolby Atmos app pre-installed that can be used to customize sound profiles based on the media you’re listening to, such as movie, music and game. Lenovo has even bundled JBL earphones with the phablet. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the general performance of the Phab 2 Plus, we found it to be overall decent during our testing. From multi-tasking to random app switching, the phablet handles everything without any issues. Even intensive games like Asphalt 8: Airborne work as they should. The big screen acts as an added bonus during media consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming to the call quality, we found it to be decent. Network reception is good, even in places like elevators and parking lots. The phablet manages to lock on to GPS networks really well too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about the battery, the Lenovo Phab 2 has a non-removable 4,050mAh battery. In our testing, it easily lasted more than a day with heavy usage, involving an hour or so of phone calls, social media usage, some video streaming and web browsing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on to the cameras, which are probably among the most important aspects of the Phab 2 Plus. The phablet comes with a dual-camera setup comprised of two 13MP modules. These are accompanied by a dual-LED flash, PDAF and laser AF. The UI of the camera app is pretty simple and offers standard features such Panorama and Night Mode, among others.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Phab 2 Plus comes with a ‘dual lens’ mode that lets you capture photos with depth of field. For these, the focus can be changed after the image is captured. But as good as it sounds, we didn’t find this feature that impressive during our testing. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Photos taken using the dual lens mode turn out to blurry and the focus is a bit off. Same is the case with the ‘Group selfie’ mode, which is aimed to help you get better selfies of multiple people, but the results turn out to be blurry and highly processed. The dual lens mode also offers a background replacement feature, which lets you cut a part of the image and place it in other images. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of the interesting features of the Phab 2 Plus’s camera app is its augmented reality mode. It makes the pictures more interactive using four available themes, which overlay animated objects over the pictures. The Pro Mode offers advanced features with manual settings such as shutter speed and focus controls.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Lenovo Phab 2 Plus is capable of recording 1080p Full HD videos and we found the videos shot with it to be decent, especially for casual use. The videos are recorded with Dolby 5.1 audio by default, which is really nice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the selfie camera, the 8MP front is quite decent too. Under natural conditions, it takes quite good images.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "With a good build quality and a massive battery as its biggest plus points, the Lenovo Phab Plus 2 is ideal for users who are looking for a device that provides great multimedia consumption experience on-the-go. The Dolby Audio is an added bonus as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if you want to make the Phab 2 Pro your everyday smartphone, its big size could be a bit of a problem. The camera experience is also average, at best. For those looking at alternatives within the same price range, we think that the \n",
      "Xiaomi Mi Max  is a much better option.\n",

      " Updated: Aug 30, 2017, 04:23PM IST\n",
      " NEW DELHI: LG is one smartphone maker which somehow skips the consideration set of prospective buyers. It’s a bit surprising as the South Korean tech firm delivers decent-looking smartphones which perform admirably but is left behind due to certain factors.However, this year the firm took a bold step, much like its South Korean rival Samsung, and launched its flagship G6 smartphone with a requisite better display, what it calls as the ‘FullVision’ display with 18:9 aspect ratio. \n",
      "\n",
      "The company soon realised that there could be more adopters for it in the budget segment. And materializing the idea, the company then launched the LG Q6, which comes with the same ‘FullVision’ display and is priced at Rs 14,999. We got a chance to use the LG Q6 for a few days. The smartphone is definitely compact and has an impressive display. But does the story ends here for the Q6 or is there something more? Here’s our review.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Design and display\n",
      "\n",
      "The LG Q6 gets a mixed reaction from us for its build and the design it carries, along with the large display. To start on a positive note, LG has implemented the large screen on a compact body beautifully, something we said for the LG G6 as well. The handset feels compact and 'grippy' to some extent. You won’t find it bothering you while operating single-handedly or even when it’s in your pocket.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Q6 also strums the right string in the weight department as it is distributed evenly and is light. It feels sturdy enough to resist casual drops from a couple of feet or slightly more. LG says it has used Series 7000 aluminum frame on the sides to make it one of the most durable handsets out there. However, you can be pretty much sure about the display cracking if the handset falls on its face.\n",
      "\n",
      "One downside we found was the plastic back panel. The panel simply hampered the otherwise good-looking smartphone. We used the LG Q6 for just a week and started observing several minor scratches on the back. While we understand that the South Korean tech firm had to cut corners from some place or the other, this could have been one bad decision by the firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "To give you an idea, in Q6 you will get a clean back side with a large camera sensor on the top-left along with LED flash, handset name at the bottom and a speaker grille at the bottom-left. While on the right only the power button lies, the left includes the volume buttons with SIM card and microSD card trays. At the bottom, you get a headphone jack and a micro USB slot.\n",
      "\n",
      "The display is what will be the biggest sales factor for the Q6. LG, being the first to bring extended displays in lower mid-range smartphone, has made an impressive 5.5-inch (1080x2004 pixels) display. The screen has an 18:9 aspect ratio, which is not common (yet) and is found only in the LG G6 and the Samsung Galaxy S8 or S8+ (for now). Galaxy S8 and the S8+ come with 18.5:9 aspect ratio though.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, the display looks great and has been implemented well with the overall design of the Q6. Not only it makes you feel like you’re holding a 5-inch handset but also makes it way too easy to operate with one hand. Adding to it are the useful and usual features such as re-arranging options for the on-screen navigation buttons, scaling of apps according to the display resolution, Blue light filter or ‘Comfort View’ and KnockON, which lets you double tap on the screen to turn it on or off. Since there is no fingerprint sensor (unfortunately) and no face or iris scanning system in place, features such as KnockON really come in handy.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as the colours go, you won’t find the tones drastically changing while viewing the screen from different angles. The colours are well saturated and balanced but don’t expect Samsung AMOLED-like output. Of course, you’ll find it more immersive while watching Netflix or playing games.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "While the display is the strong suit for the LG Q6, its performance might not be that impressive. The handset runs on an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor, which was introduced last year in February. We should add here that LG Q6’s competitor in the same price segment, the Moto G5 Plus runs Qualcomm Snapdragon 625, which is clearly a notch up from what the Q6 uses. Both the processors were launched together.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Why LG went for a weaker processor is not yet known. However, we did notice lags and slight frame drops while playing games and working on documents simultaneously. There have been cases wherein we saw the handset struggling with apps when being used in a split screen mode. \n",
      "\n",
      "But all this doesn’t necessarily mean that the Q6 is an absolutely broken device. Stuttering is something we noticed only while heavy usage, something this handset is not made for. Average to low usage should make the apps work just fine and fluid. Most of the games too work flawlessly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Supporting the Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 is a 3GB RAM, which is ample enough to handle 5-7 apps quite well. The graphics are taken care by the Adreno 505. We ran apps like Asphalt Extreme, Adobe Lightroom, tried editing on Adobe Premier Pro and other such heavy applications and the LG Q6 did perform better than we expected in most cases. As a part of our standard testing procedure, we ran the device through Antutu and Geekbench. On Antutu it managed to hit the 40565 score, which is lower than a lot of handsets. On Geekbench the Q6 scored 632 and 2135 in single and multi-core tests, which again are not the best we’ve seen in lower-mid range smartphones.\n",
      "\n",
      "The network reception and the call quality were just fine. Other options including Bluetooth, Wi-Fi and others too worked smoothly. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We also tried the Face Unlock feature, which has been in Android smartphones as a security layer since quite some time. Face Unlock, as the name suggests, unlocks the smartphone keeping your face as the password. All you need to do is to pick up the device and smile at it. While this feature sounds captivating enough, it doesn’t give 100% results. At times, it might not unlock the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "Adding to the overall performance is the smartphone’s UI, which in this case is the LG UX. Based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, the LG UX used in the Q6 is not different to that what has been used in the LG G6 and is more of a refinement of last year’s UX. The icons, Settings page, navigation buttons and other options fail to give a ‘Wow’ effect but surely makes it easier to operate across different apps and pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "LG has not yet revealed its list of smartphones that will be receiving Android O. However, since the Q6 is one of the latest in the series, it stays as one of the prime contenders to get the update.\n",
      "\n",
      "The camera on the LG Q6 is decent and should be good enough for those who are not much into clicking professional shots. The smartphone makes use of a 13MP sensor at the back, which is quick to capture images in both daylight and low light environments. The image quality is good and the colour reproduction is close to what you see in reality. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, unlike what happens in most of the budget smartphones, the Q6’s performance in low-light impressed us. The smartphone shoots images as quickly as it does in daylight, while capturing more light. The shots captured by us during the night time were without any glaring issues. Shooting in artificial light situations is also not a hassle.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for modes and customisations, users get a good amount of options to play with. With nine filters and modes like Panorama, Food and Square, one can be creative to a certain extent. Out of these, the ‘Square’ mode is one of the most talked about modes in the LG Q6. It lets you take a shot and preview it right there on the screen, take two shots organised side-by-side, take as many as four shots in a square canvas and capture a photo matching the composition of another photo.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, you can tweak the photo size, video shooting resolution (up to Full-HD - 16:9), HDR mode, timer and a lot more. The camera UI pretty much mimics that of the LG G6. However, it looks somewhat cluttered as the options and buttons are listed on both sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the front, the LG Q6 has a 5MP front-facing camera, which the company touts, has 100-degree wide lens. Like we’ve seen in other LG smartphones lately, the Q6 too has a regular selfie mode and a wide-angle selfie mode. The options are there on top of the screen so you won’t need to dig them from within the settings. You also get the option to play around with the skin tone and filters. The front camera performs well and shouldn’t be a let down for selfie lovers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The LG Q6 delivers one of the best battery performances in a sub Rs-15000 segment. Backing the device is a 3000 mAh non-removable battery, which can run for a full working day. Regular usage brings you working time of around 9-10 hours, while during light usage you can stretch the handset’s battery for up to 12 hours or more. The Q6 also supports fast charging tech and also has a couple of options to extend the battery life. The ‘Battery Saver’ reduces or disables features like vibration and screen brightness. As expected, it also limits the background apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a Game Battery Saver mode wherein you get three options to choose from - Extended, Maximum and Custom. While the ‘Extended’ option adjusts the video resolution to save battery, the ‘Maximum’ option additionally adjusts the frame rate as well. You can activate the ‘Break Time’ feature, which reduces the screen brightness and the game performance if the game is left running for over 5 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "\n",
      "Based on our analysis, the LG Q6 has several factors that work in its favour and some that don’t. It has a beautiful display with wide 18:9 aspect ratio which we’ve seen with the flagship LG G6. The body is compact and light-weight while the battery is one of the most appealing corners in the device. The camera too works flawlessly across the board. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If the phone scores high in some aspects, it also has its fair share of lows. The back panel is a fingerprint magnet and the overall performance of the device is also not the best in class. It is definitely not meant for heavy users but is more for light and casual users. The mono speaker too holds back the device from touching perfection.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given the price tag of Rs 14,999, you can easily get your hands on to the Q6’s alternate option, the Moto G5 Plus. Although the OS updates will be reaching first, you could be missing on a good camera, display and have to settle for a minimal yet clean UI. While Q6 is one of the best mid-range smartphones by LG, it still leaves you wanting for more. If only the Q6’s price drops under Rs 12,000, it will be an absolute steal.\n",
      "\n",

      " Updated: Aug 31, 2018, 11:46AM IST\n",
      " Till a few months back, Oppo was just another smartphone maker in this hustle bustle of the Indian smartphone market. You thought of Oppo and perhaps you felt that it is a Chinese smartphone maker in every price segment that rides high on design. Come 2018 and the perception about Oppo has changed. The handset maker has been setting trends of late, especially after the Find X, which has been called as the most innovative smartphone of the year so far. Maybe that’s taking it a bit far but you can’t deny that Oppo has been taking certain risks to stand out from the crowd. \n",
      "\n",
      "After establishing their flagship, the company has now expanded its mid-segment smartphone range, the F-series, with the launch of the F9 Pro. Launched at a price of Rs 23,990, the Oppo F9 Pro has a couple of highlights -- gradient dual-tone design, fast charging support and a waterdrop notch. We have explored all these parameters during the time we spent with the device to see whether they are enough to convince you to make it your next smartphone:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DesignTaking the notch design up a notch (pun unintended), Oppo has introduced what they are calling a waterdrop notch. Compared to all the notch-sporting handsets we have seen since the launch of\n",
      " iPhone X (which is quite a lot!), the Oppo F9 Pro has the tiniest notch we have seen. It only houses the front camera on the display and a speaker on the top edge of the handset. We reached out to Oppo to ask where the proximity sensor and the light sensor are placed, but the company acted secretive on that front. Nonetheless, both of them work just fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Courtesy this tiny notch, the Oppo F9 Pro has a 90.8% screen with 19.5:9 aspect ratio. After the Oppo Find X and the Vivo NEX, this is as close as one can get to an all-screen smartphone. Originally this kind of notch was seen on the Essential Phone. In India, the Oppo F9 Pro is the first one to sport one, but certainly not the last. the upcoming smartphones from other Chinese handset makers such as Vivo and Huawei smartphones are already seen doing rounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the notch, the other highlight of the Oppo F9 Pro is its gradient design, which shows a diamond shaped pattern on the lower end of the smartphone when the light reflects on it, which is quite unique as compared to other smartphones that have a dual colour back panels. Oppo launched the F9 Pro in three colour options Sunrise Red, Twilight Blue and Starry Purple and our review unit is the Twilight Blue one that is Black from the top and turns Royal Blue towards the lower back panel. The dual colours become more vibrant due to the gradient back design which does look aesthetically appealing. But the glossy finish attracts a lot of fingerprints, that made us wipe the back of the device more often than a person should need to. \n",
      "\n",
      "The back has the dual rear camera setup, placed horizontally in a silver rim and an extended part of it also houses the LED flash. The rear side also houses the fingerprint sensor as well as Oppo branding.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as what is placed where, the Oppo F7 has a power button on the right, while the volume rocker keys and the SIM card tray is placed on the left. The 3.5mm audio jack, speaker grille and microUSB port placed at the bottom. Overall, we can say that the Oppo F9 Pro will appeal to those who are looking to buy handsets that will grab attention when they are using it. We were quite impressed with the whole look and feel of the device even though at 169g weight, the handset may feel a bit heavy to some users.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "DisplayThe display is undoubtedly one of the main talking points in the Oppo F7. It features a 6.33-inch full LTPS TFT screen of 2340x1080p resolution. It has a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a 90.8% screen that look super appealing when watching movies. However, while watching YouTube, if you zoom in to fill the display, it does cut out the video part below the notch. At the bottom of the display, you get a slim chin that is unable to house the navigation keys, and therefore they are placed on the screen. They are generally hidden while operating a full screen app but appear as soon as you tap on the screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In our experience, the display performance of the Oppo F9 Pro is quite commendable. The colours are sharp and vibrant. Whether you're watching a movie on Netflix or playing a game, the viewing experience on the handset is bang on. As compared to its predecessor, the Oppo F7, the sunlight legibility has also improved significantly. \n",
      "\n",
      "As part of the display settings, users get the option to adjust the colour temperature of the screen and font size. Also, users get an option to switch off \"Notch Area Display\" if they encounter a situation where the app content gets blocked by the notch area. The YouTube issue we mentioned above can be fixed by using this feature.\n",

      "PerformanceOppo is offering the F9 Pro with Android 8.1 Oreo with a custom ColorOS version 5.2 on the top. This means that users get a bunch of additional features and various options to tinker around with.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, you get a smart sidebar on the home screen that houses commands like screenshot, screen recording and block banner notification. The slidebar also lets you place your most widely used apps in that widget so they can be easily accessed. \n",
      "\n",
      "Oppo is offering its standard Lockscreen magazine that changes the wallpapers of the locked smartphone. And thankfully, this time, it lets you subscribe to channels such as Travel, Bollywood, Sports, Fashion etc so you don't end up watching screensavers that you haven't approved of. \n",
      "\n",
      "In the Settings, you also get an option to select the \"Quiet Time\" during which, the phone will be put to silent mode (with no vibration) except for alerts you have permitted. You also get an Assistive Ball that performs functions like Back on one tap, Opening multitasking window on double tap and Home screen on touch and Hold. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for security, users get both fingerprint scanner and a facial unlock support, both of which are super quick to unlock the smartphone. There is a Oppo Secure keyboard that appears every time you have to input a password or OTP-Pin. \n",
      "\n",
      "While that was all about the functions of the Oppo F9 Pro, in terms of specs, the handset packs the MediaTek Helio P60, an octa-core chipset fabricated on a 12nm process. This chipset is specifically designed to support AI processing. The handset comes with a 6GB RAM and 64GB internal storage with the support for microSD card support as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Oppo F9 Pro handled the routine tasks without any hiccups. We were quite satisfied with the performance of the device. We did not face any issues such as lags or heating of any kind during our time with the device.The speaker output is also more than satisfactory. Both the call quality and the audio quality are also quite good.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Camera\n",
      "Unlike its predecessor Oppo F7, the F9 Pro features a dual rear camera setup. It has a 16-megapixel sensor with f/1.8 aperture and a 2-megapixel sensor with an aperture of f/2.4 for depth effect. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The camera app also is endowed with a lot of features. Besides the HDR mode, there is a Super Vivid mode that increases the contrast. Users also get AR stickers and various filters in-built in the camera app of the smartphone. Selecting the Portrait Mode while using the rear camera enables iPhone like portrait lighting effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "In our experience, the handset managed to capture pretty good night time shots. Something we also saw on the Oppo F7 as well. The day time shots were also detailed and were captured with accurate colours. Besides the design, the images capturing capability is certainly the other highlight of the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The 25-megapixel front camera with f/2.0 aperture will also meet your needs if you are looking for a camera that will beautify all your facial flaws. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Battery\n",
      "With the F9 Pro, Oppo has introduced what it is calling the VOOC charging. For those familiar with the smartphone market, can understand that it is similar to what we saw with OnePlus devices. It packs a 3500mAh that lasts just about a day easily with slightly heavy usage. But their claim is strong on how quickly it charges and not how long it lasts. We tested out their claim of 2 hours of talk time with 5-minutes of charge. From a complete discharge, the handset managed to charge 9% in 5 minutes and lasted over 50 minutes during the call. Overall, it took us half hour to completely charge the phone, which was similar to what we have seen on the OnePlus 6. \n",
      "\n",
      "This involves routine tasks, as well as GPS tracking, watching Netflix and more. For a more moderate user, it can sustain more than a day's work load. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "When it comes to the Oppo F9 Pro, the handset passes with flying colours in terms of design and display and to an extent in the camera department as well. It also manages to charge quickly like the OnePlus 6, which is quite impressive. If that is what you are looking for in your next smartphone, then the Oppo F9 Pro will not disappoint you. \n",
      "\n",
      "Having said that, where the Oppo F9 Pro falls short is the processor. The handset is powered by MediaTek P60 processor. Perception matters in this industry and the moment you utter MediaTek, the sense you get is that perhaps it’s not a phone worth spending your hard earned cash on. Even though the handset works smoothly, we must point out that this is the same processor as the one in the Realme 1, which is selling at a starting price of Rs 10,990. So if you feel that you are overpaying for the device, you must know that it is for the design, fast charging and for the display. \n",

Pretty soon you might see a lot of ads or hoardings of a new smartphone brand called Realme and it could remind you of Xiaomi’s Redmi series smartphones. However, don’t get confused as it is not part of Xiaomi’s family but is a series launched by its rival Oppo to take on that series precisely.\n",

      "Launched for the first time in India, Oppo has offered only one smartphone in this series called the Realme 1. With a starting price of Rs 8,990, this smartphone will have its hands full taking on the army of devices that already exist in a crowded segment. Oppo certainly has its task cut out if it wants to establish itself as a worthy contender in this segment. On paper, it has pretty standard specs as any other budget device but does it have what it takes to be the new king of the sub-Rs 10,000 category, we find out: \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Design\n",
      "Being touted as one of the main highlights of the device, the design of the Realme 1 smartphone is definitely a bit different when compared competition. Oppo has brought its so-called trademark diamond cut back design, which was so far only seen in its flagship smartphones, to the budget handset. Seeing how all the sub-Rs 15,000 smartphones look alike, the Realme 1 back panel is certainly a refreshing change.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Having said that, this diamond cut back is placed on a acrylic plastic body with a high gloss finish, making it terribly prone to fingerprints and smudges. Besides the Realme branding in the center and Oppo branding at the bottom, the back also houses the 13MP camera along with a LED flash on the top right corner, at the exact spots as the Oppo F7. Incidentally, the Realme 1 and the Oppo F7 have the exact same dimensions (156x75.3x7.8mm) and weight (158g), so it is like a new wine in an old bottle. \n",
      "\n",
      "The placement of the buttons is also familiar with power button on the right along with hybrid SIM slot, volume rocker keys on the left and 3.5mm audio jack, speaker grille and microUSB port placed at the bottom. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Display\n",
      "Much like its competitors, the Realme 1 handset too features an 18:9 aspect ratio full HD+ display of 2160x1080p resolution. This means that it doesn't have notch -- the infamous design trend that has become a trademark for premium smartphones -- but features display with rounded corners. Like most other full screen handsets, the Realme 1 too has on-screen navigation key that hides while operating a full screen app but appear as soon as you tap on the screen.\n",

      "Moving on to the operating system, the Realme 1 runs on Oppo’s ColorOS 5.0 UI based on Android Oreo 8.1 out-of-the-box and therefore comes with heavy customizations including home screen and lock screen magazines, where you can let it select your photos also to pick from as wallpapers and rearrangement of navigation keys as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

Users also get 'Smart Convenience' features that include gesture and motion support such as 3-finger screenshot and an assistive ball, that can be used for almost all your basic commands such as going in the lock screen mode, accessing the notification centre. During our time with the device, we felt that even though you get more and more used to these features with regular usage and it is certainly convenient, but is not an absolute necessity for the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is another feature called the Clone Apps that generates another copy of an app on your smartphone.

Talking about the security, the Realme 1 has a facial unlock feature, like many other smartphones of this category but skips the fingerprint sensor. For us, the facial recognition worked most of the times, but we did miss the presence of the fingerprint sensor when we were using the device in a dark room as the camera could not detect our face in low-lit conditions.\n",

The issue persists with the speaker placed at the bottom as the sound gets muffled when the device is placed in landscape mode.

The results were much better in case of direct sunlight shots, but much worse in night-light with as there was too much noise. The 8MP front camera worked pretty well for the extremely well-lit conditions but turned out to be a downer in other times.

Almost every brand worth its salt is in a race to launch handsets and fervently hope that they catch the consumer’s fancy. One such brand is Chinese handset maker Realme which has expanded its Realme line-up of smartphones with its latest offering Realme 2 Pro. The idea remains the same: tackle the competition coming from rival smartphone players in the Indian market. Realme 2 Pro was launched soon after about a month of Realme 2’s launch. While Realme 2 came at a sub-10K price with Qualcomm Snapdragon 450 processor, Realme 2 Pro comes at a sub-20K price and with Snapdragon 660.

Hence, the smartphone comes in these variants: 4GB+64GB, 6GB+64GB and 8GB+128GB. The 4GB+64GB variant has been priced at Rs 13,990 while the 6GB+64GB variant comes at Rs 15,990. The 8GB+128GB variant has been launched at a price tag of Rs 17,990.\n",
      "\n",
      "We got our hands on the Black Sea variant of the smartphone with 8GB RAM+128GB ROM. Here is how it fared in our review:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 2 Pro design\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 2 Pro sports a dewdrop notch design with a quite sturdy metal body sandwiched between a 2.5D front glass and a glass back. The front side of the phone carries the selfie camera and the earpiece inside the notch. A 2.5D glass serves as the screen of the phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The bottom edge of the phone carries the speaker vents, a micro-USB port for charging (not Type-C), the microphone and a 3.5mm audio jack. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The back of the phone comes with a glass back and houses the dual cameras with the LED flash, a fingerprint sensor and the ‘Realme’ logo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the left side of the phone lie the dual-SIM card slot (with a dedicated microSD card slot) and the volume buttons while the right side has got the power button.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phone dimensions are 156.7 × 74.0 × 8.5mm and it weighs 174g. It is quite sturdy, slightly on the heavier side and yet comfortable to hold with one hand. Holding it with both hands while gaming felt comfortable and easy-peasy. The body of the phone is susceptible to fingerprints and smudges.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a 3500mAh lithium battery under the hood, the smartphone is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 AIE processor and runs ColorOS 5.2 operating system based on Android 8.1. The various available sensors are light and distance sensor, acceleration sensor, gyroscope and geomagnetic sensor.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 2 Pro can shoot videos in 4K@30fps, 1080P@30fps and 720P@30fps. As for multimedia options, the supported music formats are MP3, AAC, APE, AMR, WAV, MID, OGG, FLAC, WMA and the supported video formats are AVI, 3GP, MP4, WMV, MKV, MOV, ASF, FLV etc. The phone supports these networks: GSM, WCDMA, TD-LTE, FDD-LTE etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 2 Pro display\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 2 Pro comes with a 6.3-inch(16cm) FHD+ full screen with 90.8% screen-to-body ratio. The 6.3-inch TFT LCD display comes with a resolution of 1080x2340 and a pixel density of 409 PPI. We found the display brightness to be adequate while outdoors on Auto Brightness. The phone’s Auto Brightness feature works well indoors and we found the brightness to be sufficient when inside a well-lit room too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The display settings can be chosen from Cooler, Default and Warmer based upon your preference. If you set it to Cooler, the screen colour will be whiter than the rest. The screen colour turns slightly yellowish if Default settings are chosen and darkens more in Warmer setting. For night usage, the Night Shield setting lowers the Blue light emission from the screen and thus makes for more comfortable viewing. With different viewing angles, the screen doesn’t reflect a shift in colours and it looks fine without any noticeable change. Swiping right from the upper right side of the display opens a quick access window to which you can add apps of your choice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 2 Pro performance\n",
      "\n",
      "As in \n",
      "Realme 2, the UI here is also simple and easy to navigate through and the smartphone doesn’t come bundled with bloatware. Users who don’t like to fiddle around too much with their phone would find it pleasing. The Snapdragon 660 processor and \n",
      "8GB RAM make this phone capable of handling several tasks at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gaming was a fluid experience on this phone with high-end games like PUBG Mobile running well at both medium and high settings. The Realme Game Space works around its charm with its Graphics Acceleration and No Disturbance settings. Whenever you install a new game app, Game Space recognises and includes it for an optimized gaming experience. We didn’t encounter lags while playing through the battery drop is something to be expected while playing at high settings. Also, the smartphone got slightly heated up after over one hour of play.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s come to the audio department. When on speakers, the phone is capable of filling the whole room with sound that distorts a little at maximum volume but otherwise doesn’t sound harsh on the ears below near maximum volume levels. Watching music videos and movies with the phone on speakers was a nice experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 2 Pro camera\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, last but far from the least, let’s come to the camera segment. The phone features a 16MP AI-powered dual camera setup with an aperture of F1.7 and a front camera of 16MP with F2.0 aperture. So, both rear and front cameras are 16MP.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Portrait mode, you can choose from various lighting options like Natural Light, Film Light, Mono-Tone Light, RIM Light and Bi-Colour Light. The other modes that you can shoot in are Time Lapse, Photo, Video, Sticker, Pano and Expert. The Expert mode allows you to shoot in Ultra HD mode which you can turn on/off.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outdoors, in bright sunlight and overcast conditions, both the rear and the front cameras gave clear and detailed shots with very less grain. However, the colours in the photos came out to be slightly drained of natural colours. The AI cameras detect faces well in selfie shots, even in low-light settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Everything was going well and good for Realme 2 Pro till we came to test its camera in the night and low-light settings. As you may have got a slight inkling of how it fared, let’s elaborate upon you how it did. The camera shots in the night and in low-light conditions disappoint a little because the photos that came out were not sharp, had a lot of grain and the overall colour quality wasn’t rich enough. By rich, we don’t mean that we were looking for photos with some extraneous insertion of colour or highlighting of particular parts in a photo but how it should it be captured as the moment you are trying to capture actually is, with sharpness and clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The selfies taken in extremely dark conditions came out to be a little blurry with or without the flash. The Expert mode with Ultra HD on couldn’t save the camera from failing to perform during night, outdoors or indoors. Final verdict on cameras? Yes, they will give you sharp and clear photos during daytime but not during the night.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 2 battery\n",
      "\n",
      "The phone took around one and a half hours for a complete charge. On light use, the battery lasts for more than a day. On heavy usage (gaming for around 2 hours, watching videos for about 1 hour, listening to music etc.), the battery lasted for 7-8 hours. If you are the type of user whose smartphone usage oscillates between light to heavy, the 3500mAh phone battery will see you through one day easily. During charging, the smartphone rear heats up a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Geekbench 4 benchmark test, the smartphone got 1447 in Single-Core Score and 5520 in Multi-Core Score. On AnTuTu benchmark, the phone got a score of 132918.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 2 Pro is certainly the ‘pro’ model from Realme so far. Under Rs 20K, it gives you 8GB RAM, Snapdragon 660 processor and 128GB native storage. Its battery life lasts one whole day on light to medium usage. The phone design is simplistic in looks but very much sturdy. It also gave a good gaming and audio performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Compared to Realme 2, this smartphone (8GB+128GB variant) is a considerable improvement with good performance in almost all departments, if we leave out camera shots during night time. The model that we reviewed comes at a price tag of 17,990. If you can stretch your budget to 25K, there are phones that will give you a better camera performance during the night like \n",
      "Huawei’s Nova 3i. Besides, for an overall good performance, there are Nokia 7 Plus and Xiaomi’s Pocophone. But if you cannot stretch it beyond 20K, don’t like to fiddle around too much with your phone and your priorities are gaming and multimedia consumption, you would find Realme 2 Pro a good choice only if you wish to overlook its mediocre camera shots in the night.\n",

      " In the 1939 classic movie 'Gone With The Wind', starring Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh, there is a scene where one of the most iconic lines written in cinema was uttered. Scarlett O’hara (played by Leigh) asks Rhett Butler (played by Gable), “Where shall I go? What shall I do?” Butler replies, “Frankly, my dear, I don’t give a damn”.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the constantly updating world of smartphones that abounds with many models with average performance, there are times when one is tempted to repeat this iconic line from “Gone With The Wind.” It often becomes difficult to separate wheat from the chaff when there are so many similarly-priced, similarly-specced handsets launched almost every month. It’s getting harder for brands to have a product with a ‘difference’. So what will Chinese firm Realme do with its Realme 3 smartphone launched at a starting price of Rs 8,999? Within one year of entering the smartphone market, Realme has built a reputation for itself for launching good, affordable phones.\n",

Would the customers looking to buy a budget phone love this product? We reviewed the 4GB+64GB Radiant Blue model and here is our review for you to decide whether to shell out your money for the newest entrant in the Realme series or not.\n",

      "\n",
      "Realme 3 design\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3, unlike all the smartphones launched by Realme till now, comes in a unibody design. Our review unit had a dual tone gradient back. The company has ditched the sandwich-type design that was seen in \n",

      "Realme 2 Pro and most recently in \n",
      "Realme U1.\n",
      "\n",
      "The front of the smartphone carries a 13MP selfie camera and the earpiece inside the dewdrop notch at the top. The phone has narrow bezels on the sides and along the top edge but has got a thick chin of about 7mm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The right edge of the phone carries the power key while the left carries the two volume buttons and a dual nano SIM card slot with a dedicated space for microSD. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The top edge of the phone is plain, devoid of any buttons and hasn’t been given any orifice for the microphone while the bottom edge of the phone carries the speaker (six circular vents), the micro USB port for charging (not Type-C), two small orifices for the microphone and a 3.5mm headphone jack, all of which are arrayed from left to right.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The rear part of the phone houses the dual camera setup of 13MP+2MP along with the LED flash. The camera setup protrudes slightly by 0.3 mm or so and dual rings in Realme’s signature yellow colour have been put around the 13MP primary sensor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with the dual rear camera setup, the phone has got a fingerprint sensor on the top rear side. On the bottom left lies the revamped ‘Realme’ logo.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3 weighs about 175 grams and its dimensions are 75.6mm x 156.1mm x 8.3mm. The phone feels light in the hand and doesn’t slip from the grip despite having a glossy finish. It is a sturdy model but since it comes in a shiny plastic back, chances of getting a scratch or two seem to be there if it falls from a considerable height.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3’s body registers fingerprints and smudges. The edges of the phone are rounded and the buttons on both the right are solidly embedded inside the body. They do not tilt a little on the sideways on being pressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the rear cameras have been provided within a slightly raised enclosure, the phone does not slip or slide after being placed flat on its back on a table. The phone’s gradient back design is all glossy and looks pretty alluring with the dual colour combination of dark blue and turquoise. As far as design and looks go, Realme 3 is a refreshing change from what the Chinese firm has rolled out so far.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3 display\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3 features a 6.2-inch (15.8 cm) HD+ display with a screen-to-body ratio of 88.30 percent and an aspect ratio of 19:9. The screen resolution is 1520 x 720 pixels. The display has been given a Corning Gorilla Glass 3 protection.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As has been the case with many mid-rangers and some budget phones these days, Realme 3 has also got an Auto Brightness feature for automatically adjusting the screen brightness as per the environment it finds itself in. A button for activating that feature has been added on the right side of the brightness bar only, making it very easy to switch the brightness to Auto and switch it off when you do not want it. In some previous Realme models, this operation required going to the display settings. The new addition of the Auto Brightness button saves time and it also works smoothly.\n",
      "\n",
      "But we found the display brightness of the smartphone to be inadequate when using the phone outdoors in bright sunlight. You would have to increase it to maximum every time you use the phone in environments lit brightly by the sun. On the other hand, the brightness is optimum when the phone is used indoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "On tilting the phone, the screen turns a tad pinkish in colour. The usual Realme settings of screen colour temperature (Cooler, Default and Warmer) and Night Shield are also present through which you can alter the screen colour temperature as per your eye comfort.\n",

      "Realme 3 performance\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3 comes powered by a 12nm 2.1Ghz octa-core MediaTek Helio P70 processor and runs ColorOS v6.0 based on Android 9.0 Pie. The phone comes in two RAM and internal storage options: 3GB+32GB and 4GB+64GB. The 3GB+32GB model has been priced at Rs 8,999 while the 4GB+64GB model at Rs 10,999. The storage is expandable up to 256GB via microSD. The phone packs in a 4230mAh battery under the hood.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no fast charging feature with Realme 3 and due to that the phone takes about 3 hours to charge from zero to 100 percent. There is also its huge 4230mAh battery to account for the time taken for a full charge. During charging, the phone rear heats up a little.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The phone comes with security features like fingerprint sensor and face unlock. It took very little time to register the fingerprint and unlocking the phone with the fingerprint is pretty fast. There were no issues we came across with using the fingerprint unlock.\n",
      "\n",
      "The face unlock feature worked well during the day. The feature worked well in low light conditions too (outdoors in the night, near a marketplace). For extremely low light conditions, like in pitch black darkness, there is a Screen Brightness Compensation setting that needs to be turned on. After you turn it on, face unlocking could be easily done in pitch dark. But also, face unlocking is not very consistent, sometimes not working in low-light conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The notifications panel been revamped with a little cross just above the topmost notification to dismiss all the notifications with one tap. Swiping an individual notification on the left brings two more new icons, one that can set the timer for notifications and the other through which you can set that particular notification as an unimportant one, choose to display or not display that notification on lock screen, make it display on top of the screen, set ringtone for notification etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The icon to access the unimportant notifications is present right on the left side of the cancel-all-notifications button.\n",
      "\n",
      "The app drawer on the upper right corner of the screen carries some default icons for quick launch through which you can access camera, screenshot, messages, recent photos etc. The app drawer can be customised as per your preferences. Long pressing any icon present in the drawer will open a small window on the left through which you can choose other apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme phones usually come with minimal bloatware but Realme 3 has got quite a few of them. The list of pre-installed bloatware includes Dailyhunt, UC Browser, ShareChat, Paytm, Opera Browser, Facebook etc. They can be easily uninstalled if you wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Phone Manager setting scans the phone and tells whether you can optimise the phone further. Under this setting, you would find options like Virus Scan, Routine Test (for a comprehensive check-up of the device hardware and software), Clean Up Storage, Privacy Permissions etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "While cleaning memory, residuals and cache junk are part of automatic optimisation, you can also optimise your phone more manually. Like you can put apps under App Lock (needs a passcode to be put) and enable Personal Information Protection that is said to prevent your private info such as contacts from leaking via any app.\n",
      "\n",
      "The phone supports 2.4G Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2. The various sensors equipped with the phone are fingerprint sensor, E-Compass, light sensor, proximity sensor, gravity sensor, accelerometer sensor and OTG.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme phones, till now, have performed well the gaming department, courtesy the Game Space setting for game optimization. It automatically helps users store the newly installed games and optimizes the gaming. Whenever you install a new game, it will be recognized and included in Game Space. Then when you open that game, relevant game optimization functions will be turned on to make gaming smoother for you. Some other optimization features are Brightness Lock (disables automatic brightness during gaming), Smoothness Optimization etc. You can choose from three game modes: Balanced, High Performance and Low Power Consumption Modes.\n",
      "\n",
      "With high-end gaming titles like PUBG Mobile, the phone gave a good gaming performance on medium settings. On high settings, however, the game lagged at some points during the match but overall, gaming was a nice experience on this device. The smartphone heats up a little, but only after an hour-and-a-half of gameplay. Realme 3 settles comfortably in the palms when gaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "The audio performance of the device on speakers can’t be said to stand out as the sound, with the speakers on full volume, does not even fill a small room. The phone speakers are not loud. If you are planning to watch a film or a TV show on Realme 3, it would be better to use a headphone.\n",
      "\n",
      "On AnTuTu benchmark test, Realme 3 (RMX1825) got a score of 133908. On Geekbench 4 benchmark test, the phone got 1481 as the single-core score and 5120 in multi-core score.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3 camera\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3’s 13MP+2MP dual rear camera does a fine job of snapping photos during the day in sunny weather and in overcast conditions. While outdoors in sunlight, the photos came out to be very bright and clear; there was minimal grain in objects close to the camera. But as the object’s/person’s distance from the camera lens begins to increase (like about 3-4 metres), graininess begins to creep in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The front 13MP AI camera performs well when taking selfies or group selfies outdoors in bright sunlight. Being an AI camera, it detects the different faces in a group selfies.\n",
      "\n",
      "While indoors, under artificial lighting, the selfie shots came out a little brighter than what you would expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all the low-light camera shots (not the portrait mode), be they from the rear camera or the front, the sharpness and natural colour saturation in the photos is missing. They are grainy, the edges of the objects not coming out to be defined, the colours seeping out from the boundaries in some shots and they are also plagued with blurry backgrounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Selfie shots taken in portrait mode in indoor lighting smoothen a skin tone a bit but if the phone is not placed at the right distance from the face (you’ll get a screen notification if the camera lens is closer or further than it needs to for the ideal shot), then the edges of the face, especially near the head, do not blur effectively, leaving smudged out edges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Selfie shots in portrait mode in low-light conditions do effective blurring of the background, with the edges of the face intact. When taken in normal photo mode, the edges of the face still remain intact but the blurriness of the background does not make the face stand out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the cameras seem to give satisfactory shots only in the presence of some strong light, be it sunlight or indoor light. The image quality is also dependent upon the closeness of the object (not in the portrait mode). They need the assistance of bright light and close proximity of the person/object to give sharp and clear shots. The portrait mode camera shots are praiseworthy, both during the day and in the night when indoors (but not in low-light conditions).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nightscape mode\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s talk about the much talked about camera mode of Realme 3--the Nightscape mode. Here we have two samples of photos. The first one is shot without using the Nightscape mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the same setting has been captured with the Nightscape mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Isn’t there something out of place with this photo? Many things. The first thing you’ll notice is that it doesn’t look like night only in the photo, if you look at the background of the sky behind the trees. It looks like dusk, when the sun is just about to set. Sure, the objects look sharper, their outlines clearer, the haziness of the overhead lamps has also gotten reduced. But while the photo without the Nightscape mode was hazy and not sharp, the one taken with this mode on is grainy, even if it manages to sharpen the image. It also fills in extra light and there has been a surge in colour saturation. The Nightscape mode does improve the quality of shots but changes the natural colours in the image too. Bottomline: the image does not come out to be natural.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some other snaps with normal camera shots on the top and Nightscape mode on the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chroma Boost mode just increases the colour saturation in the shots.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, once again, a Realme phone has failed in the low-light camera test. Final word: the day shots are good, portrait mode shots are also good and everything is sunny for Realme 3 camera as long as you take photos in light-suffused environments. But camera performance spirals downwards in low-light settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3 battery\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3’s battery is one of the strongest features of the phone and one of the few features the phone could pride itself at. It can make the phone run easily for over a day if your smartphone usage consists of gaming for about one hour a day, watching 3-4 videos of about 15-20 minutes, playing music for an hour or so, checking social media feeds etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 4230mAh battery starts draining at a fast rate when playing games on this device but stabilises after some time. If you play high-end games on this smartphone for over 3 hours a day, then you might need to put it on charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3 has been given some battery optimisation features like Super High Power Efficiency, Smart Power Saver and Sleeping Mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the battery levels reach 20 percent, a message will pop asking you to switch on ‘Deep Power Down’ setting. When you do that, and choose Super High Power Efficiency setting, it will reduce screen brightness, switch off the screen after inactivity of 15 seconds and disable background sync.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sleeping Mode, as per the company, senses when the user is asleep, and can switch the phone to low power mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "On heavy phone usage (with multitasking) on full brightness and without activating any battery optimisation settings, the battery can go on for an average of 9-10 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are a light user who does not use the phone much apart from checking social media accounts once or twice a day, take a few short duration calls, watch some short video clips, emailing etc then Realme 3 could even run up to two days. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "\n",

It’s getting harder for brands to have a product with a ‘difference’. So what will Chinese firm Realme do with its Realme 3 smartphone launched at a starting price of Rs 8,999?

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The rear part of the phone houses the dual camera setup of 13MP+2MP along with the LED flash. The camera setup protrudes slightly by 0.3 mm or so and dual rings in Realme’s signature yellow colour have been put around the 13MP primary sensor.\n",

      "\n",
      "The face unlock feature worked well during the day. The feature worked well in low light conditions too (outdoors in the night, near a marketplace). For extremely low light conditions, like in pitch black darkness, there is a Screen Brightness Compensation setting that needs to be turned on. After you turn it on, face unlocking could be easily done in pitch dark. But also, face unlocking is not very consistent, sometimes not working in low-light conditions.\n",

      "\n",
      "The app drawer on the upper right corner of the screen carries some default icons for quick launch through which you can access camera, screenshot, messages, recent photos etc. The app drawer can be customised as per your preferences. Long pressing any icon present in the drawer will open a small window on the left through which you can choose other apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme phones usually come with minimal bloatware but Realme 3 has got quite a few of them. The list of pre-installed bloatware includes Dailyhunt, UC Browser, ShareChat, Paytm, Opera Browser, Facebook etc. They can be easily uninstalled if you wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Phone Manager setting scans the phone and tells whether you can optimise the phone further. Under this setting, you would find options like Virus Scan, Routine Test (for a comprehensive check-up of the device hardware and software), Clean Up Storage, Privacy Permissions etc.\n",

      "While cleaning memory, residuals and cache junk are part of automatic optimisation, you can also optimise your phone more manually.

Then when you open that game, relevant game optimization functions will be turned on to make gaming smoother for you. Some other optimization features are Brightness Lock (disables automatic brightness during gaming), Smoothness Optimization etc. You can choose from three game modes: Balanced, High Performance and Low Power Consumption Modes.\n",
      "\n",
      "With high-end gaming titles like PUBG Mobile, the phone gave a good gaming performance on medium settings. On high settings, however, the game lagged at some points during the match but overall, gaming was a nice experience on this device. The smartphone heats up a little, but only after an hour-and-a-half of gameplay. Realme 3 settles comfortably in the palms when gaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "The audio performance of the device on speakers can’t be said to stand out as the sound, with the speakers on full volume, does not even fill a small room. The phone speakers are not loud. If you are planning to watch a film or a TV show on Realme 3, it would be better to use a headphone.\n",
      "\n",
      "On AnTuTu benchmark test, Realme 3 (RMX1825) got a score of 133908. On Geekbench 4 benchmark test, the phone got 1481 as the single-core score and 5120 in multi-core score.\n",

      "Realme 3 camera\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3’s 13MP+2MP dual rear camera does a fine job of snapping photos during the day in sunny weather and in overcast conditions. While outdoors in sunlight, the photos came out to be very bright and clear; there was minimal grain in objects close to the camera. But as the object’s/person’s distance from the camera lens begins to increase (like about 3-4 metres), graininess begins to creep in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The front 13MP AI camera performs well when taking selfies or group selfies outdoors in bright sunlight. Being an AI camera, it detects the different faces in a group selfies.\n",
      "\n",
      "While indoors, under artificial lighting, the selfie shots came out a little brighter than what you would expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all the low-light camera shots (not the portrait mode), be they from the rear camera or the front, the sharpness and natural colour saturation in the photos is missing. They are grainy, the edges of the objects not coming out to be defined, the colours seeping out from the boundaries in some shots and they are also plagued with blurry backgrounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Selfie shots taken in portrait mode in indoor lighting smoothen a skin tone a bit but if the phone is not placed at the right distance from the face (you’ll get a screen notification if the camera lens is closer or further than it needs to for the ideal shot), then the edges of the face, especially near the head, do not blur effectively, leaving smudged out edges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Selfie shots in portrait mode in low-light conditions do effective blurring of the background, with the edges of the face intact. When taken in normal photo mode, the edges of the face still remain intact but the blurriness of the background does not make the face stand out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the cameras seem to give satisfactory shots only in the presence of some strong light, be it sunlight or indoor light. The image quality is also dependent upon the closeness of the object (not in the portrait mode). They need the assistance of bright light and close proximity of the person/object to give sharp and clear shots. The portrait mode camera shots are praiseworthy, both during the day and in the night when indoors (but not in low-light conditions).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nightscape mode\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s talk about the much talked about camera mode of Realme 3--the Nightscape mode. Here we have two samples of photos. The first one is shot without using the Nightscape mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the same setting has been captured with the Nightscape mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Isn’t there something out of place with this photo? Many things. The first thing you’ll notice is that it doesn’t look like night only in the photo, if you look at the background of the sky behind the trees. It looks like dusk, when the sun is just about to set. Sure, the objects look sharper, their outlines clearer, the haziness of the overhead lamps has also gotten reduced. But while the photo without the Nightscape mode was hazy and not sharp, the one taken with this mode on is grainy, even if it manages to sharpen the image. It also fills in extra light and there has been a surge in colour saturation. The Nightscape mode does improve the quality of shots but changes the natural colours in the image too. Bottomline: the image does not come out to be natural.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some other snaps with normal camera shots on the top and Nightscape mode on the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chroma Boost mode just increases the colour saturation in the shots.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, once again, a Realme phone has failed in the low-light camera test. Final word: the day shots are good, portrait mode shots are also good and everything is sunny for Realme 3 camera as long as you take photos in light-suffused environments. But camera performance spirals downwards in low-light settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3 battery\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3’s battery is one of the strongest features of the phone and one of the few features the phone could pride itself at. It can make the phone run easily for over a day if your smartphone usage consists of gaming for about one hour a day, watching 3-4 videos of about 15-20 minutes, playing music for an hour or so, checking social media feeds etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 4230mAh battery starts draining at a fast rate when playing games on this device but stabilises after some time. If you play high-end games on this smartphone for over 3 hours a day, then you might need to put it on charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3 has been given some battery optimisation features like Super High Power Efficiency, Smart Power Saver and Sleeping Mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the battery levels reach 20 percent, a message will pop asking you to switch on ‘Deep Power Down’ setting. When you do that, and choose Super High Power Efficiency setting, it will reduce screen brightness, switch off the screen after inactivity of 15 seconds and disable background sync.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sleeping Mode, as per the company, senses when the user is asleep, and can switch the phone to low power mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "On heavy phone usage (with multitasking) on full brightness and without activating any battery optimisation settings, the battery can go on for an average of 9-10 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are a light user who does not use the phone much apart from checking social media accounts once or twice a day, take a few short duration calls, watch some short video clips, emailing etc then Realme 3 could even run up to two days. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "\n",
      "You may like this value-for-money offering by Realme if your budget is around Rs 10k, want a phone with a good design and long battery life, and if you belong to that rare crop of people for whom the camera performance in low-light is of little importance.

      "The app drawer on the upper right corner of the screen carries some default icons for quick launch through which you can access camera, screenshot, messages, recent photos etc. The app drawer can be customised as per your preferences. Long pressing any icon present in the drawer will open a small window on the left through which you can choose other apps.\n",

      "Realme phones usually come with minimal bloatware but Realme 3 has got quite a few of them. The list of pre-installed bloatware includes Dailyhunt, UC Browser, ShareChat, Paytm, Opera Browser, Facebook etc. They can be easily uninstalled if you wish.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Phone Manager setting scans the phone and tells whether you can optimise the phone further. Under this setting, you would find options like Virus Scan, Routine Test (for a comprehensive check-up of the device hardware and software), Clean Up Storage, Privacy Permissions etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "While cleaning memory, residuals and cache junk are part of automatic optimisation, you can also optimise your phone more manually. Like you can put apps under App Lock (needs a passcode to be put) and enable Personal Information Protection that is said to prevent your private info such as contacts from leaking via any app.\n",
      "\n",

      "Realme phones, till now, have performed well the gaming department, courtesy the Game Space setting for game optimization. It automatically helps users store the newly installed games and optimizes the gaming. Whenever you install a new game, it will be recognized and included in Game Space. Then when you open that game, relevant game optimization functions will be turned on to make gaming smoother for you. Some other optimization features are Brightness Lock (disables automatic brightness during gaming), Smoothness Optimization etc. You can choose from three game modes: Balanced, High Performance and Low Power Consumption Modes.\n",
      "\n",
      "With high-end gaming titles like PUBG Mobile, the phone gave a good gaming performance on medium settings. On high settings, however, the game lagged at some points during the match but overall, gaming was a nice experience on this device. The smartphone heats up a little, but only after an hour-and-a-half of gameplay. Realme 3 settles comfortably in the palms when gaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "The audio performance of the device on speakers can’t be said to stand out as the sound, with the speakers on full volume, does not even fill a small room. The phone speakers are not loud. If you are planning to watch a film or a TV show on Realme 3, it would be better to use a headphone.\n",
      "\n",
      "On AnTuTu benchmark test, Realme 3 (RMX1825) got a score of 133908. On Geekbench 4 benchmark test, the phone got 1481 as the single-core score and 5120 in multi-core score.\n",

      "Realme 3 camera\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3’s 13MP+2MP dual rear camera does a fine job of snapping photos during the day in sunny weather and in overcast conditions. While outdoors in sunlight, the photos came out to be very bright and clear; there was minimal grain in objects close to the camera. But as the object’s/person’s distance from the camera lens begins to increase (like about 3-4 metres), graininess begins to creep in.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The front 13MP AI camera performs well when taking selfies or group selfies outdoors in bright sunlight. Being an AI camera, it detects the different faces in a group selfies.\n",
      "\n",
      "While indoors, under artificial lighting, the selfie shots came out a little brighter than what you would expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all the low-light camera shots (not the portrait mode), be they from the rear camera or the front, the sharpness and natural colour saturation in the photos is missing. They are grainy, the edges of the objects not coming out to be defined, the colours seeping out from the boundaries in some shots and they are also plagued with blurry backgrounds.\n",
      "\n",
      "Selfie shots taken in portrait mode in indoor lighting smoothen a skin tone a bit but if the phone is not placed at the right distance from the face (you’ll get a screen notification if the camera lens is closer or further than it needs to for the ideal shot), then the edges of the face, especially near the head, do not blur effectively, leaving smudged out edges.\n",
      "\n",
      "Selfie shots in portrait mode in low-light conditions do effective blurring of the background, with the edges of the face intact. When taken in normal photo mode, the edges of the face still remain intact but the blurriness of the background does not make the face stand out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the cameras seem to give satisfactory shots only in the presence of some strong light, be it sunlight or indoor light. The image quality is also dependent upon the closeness of the object (not in the portrait mode). They need the assistance of bright light and close proximity of the person/object to give sharp and clear shots. The portrait mode camera shots are praiseworthy, both during the day and in the night when indoors (but not in low-light conditions).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nightscape mode\n",
      "\n",
      "Let’s talk about the much talked about camera mode of Realme 3--the Nightscape mode. Here we have two samples of photos. The first one is shot without using the Nightscape mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the same setting has been captured with the Nightscape mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Isn’t there something out of place with this photo? Many things. The first thing you’ll notice is that it doesn’t look like night only in the photo, if you look at the background of the sky behind the trees. It looks like dusk, when the sun is just about to set. Sure, the objects look sharper, their outlines clearer, the haziness of the overhead lamps has also gotten reduced. But while the photo without the Nightscape mode was hazy and not sharp, the one taken with this mode on is grainy, even if it manages to sharpen the image. It also fills in extra light and there has been a surge in colour saturation. The Nightscape mode does improve the quality of shots but changes the natural colours in the image too. Bottomline: the image does not come out to be natural.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some other snaps with normal camera shots on the top and Nightscape mode on the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Chroma Boost mode just increases the colour saturation in the shots.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, once again, a Realme phone has failed in the low-light camera test. Final word: the day shots are good, portrait mode shots are also good and everything is sunny for Realme 3 camera as long as you take photos in light-suffused environments. But camera performance spirals downwards in low-light settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3 battery\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3’s battery is one of the strongest features of the phone and one of the few features the phone could pride itself at. It can make the phone run easily for over a day if your smartphone usage consists of gaming for about one hour a day, watching 3-4 videos of about 15-20 minutes, playing music for an hour or so, checking social media feeds etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 4230mAh battery starts draining at a fast rate when playing games on this device but stabilises after some time. If you play high-end games on this smartphone for over 3 hours a day, then you might need to put it on charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme 3 has been given some battery optimisation features like Super High Power Efficiency, Smart Power Saver and Sleeping Mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "When the battery levels reach 20 percent, a message will pop asking you to switch on ‘Deep Power Down’ setting. When you do that, and choose Super High Power Efficiency setting, it will reduce screen brightness, switch off the screen after inactivity of 15 seconds and disable background sync.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sleeping Mode, as per the company, senses when the user is asleep, and can switch the phone to low power mode.\n",
      "\n",
      "On heavy phone usage (with multitasking) on full brightness and without activating any battery optimisation settings, the battery can go on for an average of 9-10 hours.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you are a light user who does not use the phone much apart from checking social media accounts once or twice a day, take a few short duration calls, watch some short video clips, emailing etc then Realme 3 could even run up to two days. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "\n",
      "You may like this value-for-money offering by Realme if your budget is around Rs 10k, want a phone with a good design and long battery life, and if you belong to that rare crop of people for whom the camera performance in low-light is of little importance. The UI, on MediaTek Helio P70 processor, runs smoothly, the gaming performance is good but the camera performance in low-light cannot be said to have been improved from previous Realme models. Low-light shots still remain a weakness of \n",

      " Updated: Dec 17, 2018, 01:55PM IST\n",
      " Xiaomi, for a while, now has been dominating the entry-level smartphone market with some good propositions for customers, Brands like Honor, and now Realme, have been making an attempt to dent Xiaomi’s market share. Realme has recently announced its entry-level smartphone called Realme C1 along with the Realme 2 Pro. On paper, it has pretty decent specs as any other device at this price, but does it have what it takes to outshine the competition? We find out\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme C1: Design Realme smartphones have always been good when it comes to build quality and design of budget-oriented smartphones. Even though Realme C1 is an entry-level smartphone, the build quality of the phone is good and feels premium in hand. As the major concern for a smartphone at this price range is the quality and looks, the Realme C1 gets a thumbs up from us. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The smartphone has a well-built plastic unibody construction; the glossy back score some extra point for not looking like an entry level device. It felt solid and comfortable to hold. The smartphone is a bit on a lighter side for our liking but that’s entirely subjective and some may like this fact and some might not. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the back, the first thing that stuck to our mind is the dual rear camera along with the single LED flash which is not that common in this price range. The back also comes printed with the brand logo. While the volume rocker and the SIM card tray sits at the left, the right side of the phone just has the power button. \n",
      "\n",
      "Realme has also included the good old 3.5mm audio jack at the bottom of the phone along with micro USB port charging port, speaker grille and a single microphone. \n",
      "\n",
      "The front has a notch design -- a full screen display with minimal bezels at the sides and has a thick chin at the bottom of the phone. The notch is also relatively smaller compared to other smartphones and sports the front camera, earpiece grille along with other necessary sensors. \n",
      "\n",
      "It’s surprising to see that the company has opted not to implement a fingerprint scanner in a smartphone launching in 2018. However, there’s face unlock feature which works surprisingly fast. \n",
      "\n",
      "At this price point, the company has packed a lot in the smartphone especially in terms of design and build quality which is reasonably good and we don’t have any major complaints regarding the design of the phone. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme C1: Display \n",
      "The display is another aspect where a smartphone of this price bracket suffers but the Realme C1 has a different story to tell. The smartphone feature a 6.2-inch HD+ (1520 x 720 pixel) resolution display with an aspect ratio of 19:9 and 88.8% screen-to-body percentage. Apart from this, the display also comes with Corning Gorilla Glass protection which is again not so common in a smartphone of this price. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about display quality, the colours are vibrant and punchy, viewing angles are good. The sunlight legibility of the display is quite acceptable too. The auto-brightness feature also works fine. The display also has colour temperature adjuster which allows users to choose between the warmer tone and cooler tone based on their taste. Apart from that, there’s a Night Shield option, basically, a Realme term for Blue light filter mode. Considering the price of the phone, Realme C1’s display is sub-par compared to what others are offering. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme C1: Performance \n",
      "Just like other smartphones in this price segment, the Realme C1 comes with entry-level specifications and the performance of the phone is acceptable considering what it has got under the hood. The smartphone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 430 coupled with 2GB RAM and 16GB of onboard storage which can be further expanded up to 128GGB via micro SD card. The performance of the phone is good with app opened quickly and we did notice a few lag here-n-there while navigating through menus and switching between the apps. \n",
      "\n",
      "The smartphone runs on company’s own custom user-interface ColorOS v5.1 on the top of Android 8.0 Oreo. The software provides tons of features which is hard to find in a smartphone of this price. Features like Smart Assistant (Zalo), Gesture navigation, Assistive balls, Smart Driving, Game Space further adds to the user experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "In one word, the phone has a great balance between the features and performance. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about the gaming performance of the phone, the performance from the 14nm chip is average. Light games such as Candy Crush, Temple Run etc. worked just fine. However, to play triple-A titles like PUBG, Asphalt, you might have to tone down the graphics setting a notch or two. Thankfully, Realme C1 has the Game Space feature which does a decent job of optimising games and boosts its performance a little bit but does not expect any magic to happen here. We also didn’t like the way the settings menu is designed as there are a few things which are hidden under the sub-menu. For example, storage option is hidden under the ‘Additional options’ in the menu which is the common thing for users to check. In the same way, there’s a separate ‘System apps’ option, while it could be merged in the ‘App management’ section. \n",
      "\n",
      "The audio quality from the speakers are good and clear, the vocals from the earpiece were clear too and neither we faced any issues with call quality or the signal reception of the phone. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme C1: Camera \n",
      "The Realme C1 sports a dual 13MP + 2MP rear camera with f2.2 aperture. The camera also features a PDAF (Phase detection autofocus), Bokeh mode and HDR mode. At the front, there’s an AI-enabled 5MP camera with f2.2 aperture. \n",
      "\n",
      "The image quality from the rear camera is satisfactory. The colours and details in well-lit condition are good but its starts losing on the details and image turns out to be on softer side with the decreasing amount of light. \n",
      "\n",
      "The front camera also does a decent job of capturing selfies, bokeh effect is also acceptable from the smartphone of this price range. However, the beautification mode tends to exaggerate things a bit. \n",
      "\n",
      "The camera app is like what we have seen in other Realme phones and comes with various shooting modes like time-lapse, video, portrait, sticker and pano. The app opening and closing speed are fast and we haven’t noticed any significant delay while using it. The UI too feels well designed and it is easy to skim through as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of video quality, the smartphone can shoot up to 1080p resolution and the video footage is also acceptable with decent amount of details. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme C1: Battery \n",
      "Realme C1 is backed by a 4230mAh battery, which is good to see that the company has not neglected the need of good battery life in this phone. It also comes with 5V2A charger included in the box. During our test, the smartphone lasted for more than a day with plenty of juice left to serve you till the next half under normal usage. We can expect that this smartphone will easily last for a day even with heavy usage. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme C1: Verdict \n",
      "At the price of Rs 6,999, this is certainly one of the best-looking smartphones in the market. Comparing it to the Honor 7S, Yu Ace and other smartphones in this price bracket, this is indeed a better pick than others. That being said, Realme C1 has a few shortcomings too. The camera, for example, is not up to the mark and we think it could have been better. The software still needs some refinements as well as redesigning especially in the ‘Settings’ menu. But that doesn’t stop this smartphone to make its presence felt to the competition. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "3.5/5\n",
      "                                                        \n",
      "https://www.gadgetsnow.com/reviews/realme-u1/articleshow/66689778.cms\n",
      " Updated: Mar 13, 2019, 06:58PM IST\n",
      " It’s been an eventful five months or so for Realme. For a brand which was born as Oppo’s sub-brand, Realme has been on a launch spree of a kind. The target remains the mid-range and the entry-level smartphone segment and taking on other Chinese and Korean competitors. The latest challenger is the Realme U1. The smartphone has been launched in two RAM and storage variants: 3GB+32GB and 4GB+64GB with an expandable storage up to 256GB. Realme U1 comes in three colour variants: Ambitious Black, Brave Blue and Fiery Gold. \n",
      "\n",
      "We got to review the Ambitious Black 4GB+64GB variant of the smartphone and here is how the phone delivered.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme U1 design\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme U1 flaunts a hard and sturdy body with a matte finish, sandwiched between a 2.5D glass screen and a partly smudge-and-fingerprint resistant glass back. Yes, this time around, both the front and back glass do register smudges and sweaty fingerprints but not so quickly as in other Realme models till now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme U1 weighs approximately 168 grams (battery included). The handset is 157mm long, 74mm wide and 8mm thick. It has got a super comfortable grip and feels light to hold with both the hands and also, one hand. Owing to its robust build, the U1 seems capable of taking a few falls in its stride and come out unscathed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It features the dewdrop notch design at the top front, with the earpiece and a single 25MP front camera having Sony IMX576 sensor with f/2.0 aperture. The rear side of the phone carries the dual 13MP + 2MP camera setup with f/2.2 + f/2.4 aperture and an LED flash, all towards the upper left side. At the centre of the upper-half lies the fingerprint scanner. The ‘Realme’ logo is present at the bottom half.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The left edge carries the dual SIM slot with a dedicated microSD slot and the volume keys from the top while the right edge carries the power key. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The bottom edge has got five circular small vents that serve as the speakers, a microUSB port, two small holes for the microphone and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The top edge of the phone is devoid of any buttons or microphone vents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The phone has got around 4mm thick bezels, both near the top and at the bottom and about 1mm thick bezels on the sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme seems to have reached some sort of unspoken finality when it comes to the design of their smartphones. First Realme 2, then Realme 2 Pro and now Realme U1, all these three are built alongside similar design, with Realme 2 Pro coming closest to the U1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the U1’s almost completely similar design when compared to Realme 2 Pro, there are a few subtle differences. For starters, the dual rear camera setup is embedded completely in the U1 body, unlike it being slightly raised in Realme 2 Pro. This allows for the smartphone to lie perfectly flat on its back. Also, U1’s glass back is perfectly flat and not even a little bit curved at the edges, unlike it being a wee bit curved in Realme 2 Pro. The microphone this time has two small circular orifices instead of just one in the previous phone. Lastly, the top edge of U1 does not carry any orifice for the microphone but there are two at the bottom edge. Realme 2 Pro had one at the top edge and one at the bottom edge. The U1 also has a glass back that does not register fingerprints and smudges quickly, contrary to the other phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme U1 display\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme U1 features a 6.3-inch (16 cm) LTPS IPS (In-Cell) LCD FHD+ display with a screen resolution of 2340x1080 and a pixel density of 409 PPI. The smartphone display has got a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and a screen-to-body ratio of 90.8%. The touch panel is made up of 2.5D Gorilla Glass 3. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the previous models from the company, this smartphone also comes with Auto Brightness, three screen colour temperature settings — Cooler, Default and Warmer —, Auto Screen Off (15 seconds to 30 minutes), Font Size and Night Shield features. \n",
      "\n",
      "The auto brightness feature makes the screen adapt well to the environment the phone is in like indoors or outdoors. When this feature is on, the brightness is optimized automatically if it is very low or very high according to the location of the phone in different lighting settings. You may switch off this feature too if you wish to adjust the screen brightness on your own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about the screen colour temperature settings, switching to Cooler makes the screen go totally white bereft of even a slight tinge of colour, choosing Default infuses a little tinge of warm colour to the display while Warmer setting is an eye-friendly one and makes it more comfortable to look at the screen, especially during night. These three are not the only screen colour settings but more like markers and you can slide to pick any colour setting in between two of them too. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Night Shield is meant to protect your eyes from harmful Blue-light emission. You can schedule this setting to stay active for a certain time slot, say 7 PM to 12 AM and can set a preferred warm colour temperature that suits your viewing. There are three display effects to choose from—Display in Colour, Display in Black and White and Comfortable Night-time Reading. The first setting retains the colour of the content, the second only allows black and white colours while the third displays white text on black background for night-time reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also a Notch Area Display Control setting through which you can switch off the Notch Area Display for a certain app when the notch area is blocking the app content.\n",
      "\n",
      "On tilting the screen on either side in portrait mode, it turns a tad light pink in colour. \n",
      "\n",
      "The app icon text in quite sharp and screen colours are bright. There are lots of icons available in the drop-down menu for quick access.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme U1 performance\n",
      "\n",
      "Powered by an octa-core 2.1 GHz MediaTek Helio P70 processor (ARM Cortex-A73x4,ARM Cortex-A53x4) with ARM G72 GPU, the smartphone runs ColorOS 5.2, based on Android Android 8.1. The ColorOS this time also has been kept free of bloatware. Some apps like Facebook, UC Browser and Paytm come preinstalled. The UI works smoothly and navigating through the apps is easy enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "The security options include fingerprint, face and passcode. There were no issues with the first two features while we went through each of the security measure to protect the phone from unwanted access. However, the face unlock feature didn’t work well in the night, when tested outdoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Homescreen Layout feature gives you two features to choose from: 4 x 6 and 5 x 6. Switching from one to another rearranges the app icons and their position cannot be restored. The latter layout accommodates more icons on the screen, packing them more closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "When inside an app, swipe up with three fingers (any three) from the bottom of the screen to use the split-screen option through which you can use another app in the second half of the screen. To end the split-screen mode, just swipe up with three fingers again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swiping down with three fingers will take a screenshot of the screen that you can immediately send or edit and even take a long screenshot. The maximum length of the page that can be captured with the long screenshot is 1080 x 35539.\n",
      "\n",
      "The audio output of the phone can fill a small room well and the sound is loud and clear enough to watch a video or a film on speakers. The phone comes with Real Original Sound Technology that lets you bring a little variety to the music you listen with its custom equalizer settings. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gaming is a strong feature of Realme U1, courtesy the powerful Helio P70 processor and the Realme Game Space setting that lets the device handle high-end games well without a lot of glitches. While the phone’s Game Engine technology is said to improve gaming performance by custom optimisation of both the game and the device, the Graphics Acceleration technology is said to optimise the game display configuration. The phone has a comfortable grip and titles like PUBG Mobile ran well on the device on HD graphics and high frame rates. \n",
      "\n",

The target remains the mid-range and the entry-level smartphone segment and taking on other Chinese and Korean competitors. The latest challenger is the Realme U1. The smartphone has been launched in two RAM and storage variants: 3GB+32GB and 4GB+64GB with an expandable storage up to 256GB. Realme U1 comes in three colour variants: Ambitious Black, Brave Blue and Fiery Gold. \n",

Yes, this time around, both the front and back glass do register smudges and sweaty fingerprints but not so quickly as in other Realme models till now.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme U1 weighs approximately 168 grams (battery included). The handset is 157mm long, 74mm wide and 8mm thick. It has got a super comfortable grip and feels light to hold with both the hands and also, one hand. Owing to its robust build, the U1 seems capable of taking a few falls in its stride and come out unscathed.\n",
      "\n",
      "It features the dewdrop notch design at the top front, with the earpiece and a single 25MP front camera having Sony IMX576 sensor with f/2.0 aperture. The rear side of the phone carries the dual 13MP + 2MP camera setup with f/2.2 + f/2.4 aperture and an LED flash, all towards the upper left side. At the centre of the upper-half lies the fingerprint scanner. The ‘Realme’ logo is present at the bottom half.\n",

      "\n",
      "The bottom edge has got five circular small vents that serve as the speakers, a microUSB port, two small holes for the microphone and a 3.5mm headphone jack. The top edge of the phone is devoid of any buttons or microphone vents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "Realme seems to have reached some sort of unspoken finality when it comes to the design of their smartphones. First Realme 2, then Realme 2 Pro and now Realme U1, all these three are built alongside similar design, with Realme 2 Pro coming closest to the U1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regardless of the U1’s almost completely similar design when compared to Realme 2 Pro, there are a few subtle differences. For starters, the dual rear camera setup is embedded completely in the U1 body, unlike it being slightly raised in Realme 2 Pro. This allows for the smartphone to lie perfectly flat on its back. Also, U1’s glass back is perfectly flat and not even a little bit curved at the edges, unlike it being a wee bit curved in Realme 2 Pro. The microphone this time has two small circular orifices instead of just one in the previous phone. Lastly, the top edge of U1 does not carry any orifice for the microphone but there are two at the bottom edge. Realme 2 Pro had one at the top edge and one at the bottom edge.

      "\n",
      "The auto brightness feature makes the screen adapt well to the environment the phone is in like indoors or outdoors. When this feature is on, the brightness is optimized automatically if it is very low or very high according to the location of the phone in different lighting settings. You may switch off this feature too if you wish to adjust the screen brightness on your own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about the screen colour temperature settings, switching to Cooler makes the screen go totally white bereft of even a slight tinge of colour, choosing Default infuses a little tinge of warm colour to the display while Warmer setting is an eye-friendly one and makes it more comfortable to look at the screen, especially during night. These three are not the only screen colour settings but more like markers and you can slide to pick any colour setting in between two of them too. \n",

      "Like the previous models from the company, this smartphone also comes with Auto Brightness, three screen colour temperature settings — Cooler, Default and Warmer —, Auto Screen Off (15 seconds to 30 minutes), Font Size and Night Shield features. \n",
      "\n",
      "The auto brightness feature makes the screen adapt well to the environment the phone is in like indoors or outdoors. When this feature is on, the brightness is optimized automatically if it is very low or very high according to the location of the phone in different lighting settings. You may switch off this feature too if you wish to adjust the screen brightness on your own.\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about the screen colour temperature settings, switching to Cooler makes the screen go totally white bereft of even a slight tinge of colour, choosing Default infuses a little tinge of warm colour to the display while Warmer setting is an eye-friendly one and makes it more comfortable to look at the screen, especially during night. These three are not the only screen colour settings but more like markers and you can slide to pick any colour setting in between two of them too. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Night Shield is meant to protect your eyes from harmful Blue-light emission. You can schedule this setting to stay active for a certain time slot, say 7 PM to 12 AM and can set a preferred warm colour temperature that suits your viewing. There are three display effects to choose from—Display in Colour, Display in Black and White and Comfortable Night-time Reading. The first setting retains the colour of the content, the second only allows black and white colours while the third displays white text on black background for night-time reading.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also a Notch Area Display Control setting through which you can switch off the Notch Area Display for a certain app when the notch area is blocking the app content.\n",
      "\n",
      "On tilting the screen on either side in portrait mode, it turns a tad light pink in colour. \n",
      "\n",
      "The app icon text in quite sharp and screen colours are bright. There are lots of icons available in the drop-down menu for quick access.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme U1 performance\n",
      "\n",
      "Powered by an octa-core 2.1 GHz MediaTek Helio P70 processor (ARM Cortex-A73x4,ARM Cortex-A53x4) with ARM G72 GPU, the smartphone runs ColorOS 5.2, based on Android Android 8.1. The ColorOS this time also has been kept free of bloatware. Some apps like Facebook, UC Browser and Paytm come preinstalled. The UI works smoothly and navigating through the apps is easy enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "The security options include fingerprint, face and passcode. There were no issues with the first two features while we went through each of the security measure to protect the phone from unwanted access. However, the face unlock feature didn’t work well in the night, when tested outdoors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Homescreen Layout feature gives you two features to choose from: 4 x 6 and 5 x 6. Switching from one to another rearranges the app icons and their position cannot be restored. The latter layout accommodates more icons on the screen, packing them more closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "When inside an app, swipe up with three fingers (any three) from the bottom of the screen to use the split-screen option through which you can use another app in the second half of the screen. To end the split-screen mode, just swipe up with three fingers again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swiping down with three fingers will take a screenshot of the screen that you can immediately send or edit and even take a long screenshot. The maximum length of the page that can be captured with the long screenshot is 1080 x 35539.\n",
      "\n",
      "The audio output of the phone can fill a small room well and the sound is loud and clear enough to watch a video or a film on speakers. The phone comes with Real Original Sound Technology that lets you bring a little variety to the music you listen with its custom equalizer settings. \n",
      "\n",
      "Gaming is a strong feature of Realme U1, courtesy the powerful Helio P70 processor and the Realme Game Space setting that lets the device handle high-end games well without a lot of glitches. While the phone’s Game Engine technology is said to improve gaming performance by custom optimisation of both the game and the device, the Graphics Acceleration technology is said to optimise the game display configuration. The phone has a comfortable grip and titles like PUBG Mobile ran well on the device on HD graphics and high frame rates. \n",
      "\n",
      "Realme U1 scored 1567 on Single-Core and 6001 on Multi-Core Geekbench 4 test. On AnTuTu, the phone got a score of 144798.\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about connectivity options, Realme U1 has got a dual nano-SIM card slot with microSD card support, micro-USB, a 3.5mm audio jack and supports Wi-Fi 802.11a/b/g/n/ac, 2.4GHz and 5GHz. Other connectivity options are Bluetooth 4.2 and GPS/A-GPS/Glonass.\n",
      "\n",
      "The supported networks bands are GSM: 850/900/1800/1900MHz, WCDMA: 850/900/2100MHz, FDD-LTE: Bands 1/3/5/8, TD-LTE: Bands 38/40/41 (2535-2655MHz). The phone comes with these sensors: M-sensor, G-sensor, gravity sensor, fingerprint sensor, light and proximity sensor and OTG.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme U1 camera\n",
      "\n",
      "The various camera features that Realme U1 provides the user are HDR, Super Vivid, depth effect, Smart Beauty, Custom Beauty etc. The available camera modes are Time-Lapse, Sticker, Panorama etc. The phone shoots videos in 720p and 1080p. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let’s move on to how the camera performance is. Realme brought out this phone touting its single 25MP selfie camera and even called the model India’s Selfie Pro. The 25MP front camera comes with a Sony IMX576 sensor and f/2.0 aperture. The selfie shots during the day, are clear, sharp and without grain. The selfie shots taken with HDR on do improve the clarity of the shots. The Super Vivid mode in selfies makes the skin tone look more natural but it changes the colour of the clothes also a bit, which we didn’t like. Something like that could be achieved with a photo editor tool also. The Bokeh effect blurs the background well, while retaining the edges of the object in focus.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme phones have got this one big weakness—their inability to shoot well in low-light settings. ‘India’s Selfie Pro’ is anything but pro when it comes to low-light shooting. Selfie-shots in low-light settings are not clear, with grain setting in, and in dark settings (like on the streets at night), they are not good at all, with the images coming out very grainy and stripped of colour at different small patches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme U1 is equipped with a rear dual 13MP + 2MP camera setup with f/2.2 + f/2.4 aperture and an LED flash. So, how well does the rear camera setup work?\n",
      "\n",
      "The rear camera shots in the day, while outdoors, capture the objects close to the camera quite well, clear and sharp but the distant objects came out blurry and grainy in the photos. Indoors also, the same effect was there.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In the night, while outside, the rear camera shots did not come out to be a lot grainy but the objects in the photo are not sharp and the ones in the background came out to be grainy.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In short, we were again not happy with the way Realme phones shoot in low-light, with Realme U1 being the latest model to join the list.\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme U1 battery\n",
      "\n",
      "The phone packs in a 3500mAh battery just like Realme 2 Pro and it took about one and a half hours to charge fully as the phone doesn’t come with any fast charging feature. The phone heats up a little while charging. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was able to run for one day on full charge with medium usage (calls for 1-2 hours, watching videos/listening to music for 2-3 hours, gaming for about 1 hours, WhatsApping, checking social media feeds and mails). For light users, this phone would be able to run for more than a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "For heavy users who like to multi-task, the phone will give a battery backup of about 7-8 hours. On heavy usage continuously for 2-3 hours and more, the back gets heated up a little. The battery drop is not sudden and we didn’t come across any UI-related glitches.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "\n",
      "Realme U1’s design and build quality is impressive, even if it is strikingly similar to Realme 2 Pro. It is lightweight, the battery lasts one day on average and the gaming performance is more than what you would expect from a phone priced at Rs 14,499 (4GB+64GB variant). On the flip side, the camera performance during day could have been better and during night, a lot better. Overall, it is a well-balanced phone that won’t disappoint prospective buyers. The competition is stiff but Realme seems to be on the right path and Realme U1 is a fine companion on that path. \n",

      " Samsung introduced the Galaxy M series with a view to capture more market share in the mid-segment smartphone market. With the latest smartphone series, the company aims to give tough competition to other Chinese smartphone makers such as Honor, Xiaomi and others. Presently, Samsung offer three smartphones under the Galaxy M series out of which the Galaxy M30 is the most expensive of all. The smartphone promises to offer high-end specifications at an affordable price tag of Rs 17,990. The smartphone also integrates all the latest trends such as a notch screen, triple rear camera setup, gradient finish and more. But we will have to see how it performs and does it offer anything extra as compared to its competition available in the market. We used the Samsung Galaxy M30 for sometime and try to find out what extra the device offer as compared to the other budget smartphones. Read on the complete review of the smartphone to find out.\n",

      "\n",
      "Despite the plastic body design the looks of the smartphone didn’t disappoint us. The front of the smartphone is dominated by a bright 6.4-inch AMOLED display which consists of Samsung’s Infinity U notch and is surrounded by thin bezels on all sides. Despite the large display the smartphone is quite sleek and light in weight. Its compact form factor enables users to use it easily with one hand. You will find the power button and volume rockers on the right side, while the SIM card tray is placed on the left. You can find the 3.5mm audio hack, USB Type-C charging port and the single speaker grille at the bottom. \n",
      "\n",
      "The rear of the smartphone is home to a triple rear camera setup with LED flash and a rear mounted fingerprint sensor. The smartphone gets a big thumbs up from us in the design segment. It offers a much better design as compared to the other budget smartphones available in the market.\n",

      "The Samsung Galaxy M30 comes with an AMOLED display. The smartphone features a 6.4-inch full HD+ Super AMOLED display with 1080x2340 pixel resolution and 19.5:9 aspect ratio. The device comes with a Infinity U display with surrounded by thin bezels on all the sides. The display is quite vibrant and it offers crispy and sharp colour reproduction. The display offers various modes and users can select from Adaptive to AMOLED Cinema, AMOLED photo and Basic mode depending on their needs.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Along with this, the company has also incorporated the Blue light filter which limits the emission of Blue light from the display. To enhance the user experience the company has also added the Icon frames and Double tap to wake up features to the display. The display is very bright and it offers good visibility under direct sunlight unlike its competitors available in the market. We can definitely say that display is one of the high point of Samsung Galaxy M30. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Samsung Galaxy M30: Software\n",
      "The Samsung Galaxy M30 runs Android 8.1 Oreo operating system topped with company's own Samsung One UI. At the time of the launch the company has confirmed that the device will also receive Android 9.0 Pie update. It would not be wrong to say that with the change in the UI the company has managed to improve the user experience.

The users also have the option of expanding the storage by adding a microSD card. The smartphone comes dual SIM functionality and both the SIM card offer support for 4G VoLTE. \n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about the performance, during our testing the Samsung Galaxy M30 worked smoothly. The processor is pretty good and does not disappoint in any way. The device does not lag while multi-tasking but the smartphone is not designed for hardcore gaming. This means that the PUBG lovers will be a bit disappointed as the device heats up and also lags while loading graphics. Other than this the smartphone performs all the routine tasks very well. The phone can also handle heavy editing apps without a glitch. \n",

The images clicked during daytime or in well lit conditions turned out to be fine but they also lacked detailing. The colour reproduction was also not that great. The ultra-wide angle lens also fails to capture enough amount of data but it offered decent results when used in landscape mode. The camera on the other hand focuses very fast and also takes less time in image processing. The smartphone camera also works well in the portrait mode. The camera is able to blur the background from the subject without any hassle. \n",

The smartphone offers a full HD and bright display which is not common in the other budget smartphones. Along with this, the massive 5000 mAh battery with fast charging can be a deal breaker for many. The triple rear camera is also a good proposition but is not the high point of the smartphone.

      " Moving past last years’ dud that was the Galaxy Note 7, we were quite sure that Samsung will bounce back with a great Note device this year. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is now available to users and at the first glance it looks like a worthy upgrade. And with each step of the testing phase the phone made us fall for it further (barring a few issues). Below is what we experienced during our review of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Design and Display\n",
      "Innovation is the name of the game and like Apple, Samsung has also been innovating throughout the years. Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 plus are examples of good innovation and design, with infinity display. Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is built on the same lines, yet has a different shape and feel to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "With a 6.3-inch super AMOLED infinity display and 18.5:9 aspect ratio the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 has rectangular-ish aesthetics, while the Galaxy S8 and S8 plus are more curved. The display (with Corning Gorilla glass 5 on top) is a treat to work with and showcases vibrant colours and deep blacks. Everything on this widescreen looks superb. Even the gaming experience was slightly better than found on the Galaxy S8 plus.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Note 8 comes across as a business phone built for serious users, which has a very nice grip (better than S8 Plus). Design features include a thicker metal frame running all around the sides of the smartphone. The frame also has the power button on the right along with the volume rocker and dedicated Bixby button on the left.\n",
      "\n",
      "The SIM + MicroSD card slot is positioned on the top while a mono speaker, S PEN, USB-C charging and 3.5mm audio ports are placed at the bottom. The selfie camera, sensor and ear speaker are placed above the screen. Flip the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 around and one can see not one but two rear cameras. This is the first offering by Samsung that has dual cameras. The rear also sports an awkwardly placed finger print reader (like the one found on S8 Plus), a heart rate sensor and a dual tone flash, embedded on an all-glass (Corning Gorilla 5) back. Oh, did we mention that this smartphone is IP68 ready, which means it can take a dip in the water and nothing will happen to it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance and Camera\n",
      "In India, Samsung has been bringing its flagship smartphones with Exynos CPUs instead of Snapdragon. Snapdragon is only available in USA and China. The Indian version we reviewed carried the Exynos 8895 Octa core chipset (4x2.3 GHz + 4x1.7 GHz cores). Further, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 comes in two variants when it comes to SIM slots, we used the single SIM + memory card variant.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as on board memory is concerned the \n",
      "Samsung Galaxy Note 8 has 64GB on board storage (expandable by up to 256 GB) and RAM is maxed at a nice 6 GB. Jumping over to the cameras this smartphone can give the best, a run for its money. We absolutely loved every bit of the front and rear snappers. The images from the rear 12 MP cameras come out vivid (outdoors and indoors). The results were boggling in low-light and this smartphone works exceptionally well at night too.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Thanks to the dual camera rear setup, users now have the option of Bokeh effect. This means that the users can choose the amount of blur they want in the image, even after the image has been clicked. Moreover, one can easily zoom 2X (twice over the primary camera) with the small button located at the bottom of camera screen, which switches the camera.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The front snapper has an 8MP sensor and the results here are no different. The images shot during the day, low-light and night are pleasant and vivid. Like the \n",
      "Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 front camera also comes with effects, which gives users more control over the shot, and stickers. All of this works very well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Running Android 7.1 out of the box this nifty device has minimum of bloatware. Transferring data and contacts from the previous Android device was child’s play. We were able setup and transfer everything (25 GB of photos, app, contact, text messages and more) in under 20 minutes. Samsung does supply the usual set of its apps like Samsung Health and Gear on it. All the nice things seen on Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus (like the split screen mode et al) can be found on the Note 8, too. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At a touch of a button Bixby starts running and if you are already member of Samsung’s eco system then within 2-3 clicks you will be able to start using it. The Bixby voice command is functional now. It works in a similar fashion like Google Assistant and Apple Siri, however it does need a bit of work to understand the Indian accent. One can also unlock the phone with voice, using Bixby. But, that's not the only way to unlock the Samsung Galaxy Note 8. The most common is the fingerprint sensor at the back. IRIS scanner is also available and like the S8 Plus it opens this smartphone faster than you can blink.\n",
      "\n",
      "The S-pen is spring loaded and pops out as soon as you press it. Users can take notes immediately after pulling it out, no need to unlock the screen. Memo screen appears on its own when the pen is pulled out. The air menu system comes to life when the screen is unlocked that has features like notes, translate (to translate text) and live messages. With this feature, users can send live text messages in the form of a GIF. The S-pen is pressure sensitive and we enjoyed the sketching experience with it. The apps edge is also available on the Samsung Galaxy Note 8, but we didn’t use it much. Never felt the need.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the Antutu benchmarks Samsung Galaxy Note 8 scored 1,77,024 points and on Geekbench 4 multi core CPU test it got 6,668 points and 9,402 points on compute test. Everything indicating extreme performance. However, the phone does get slightly hot when we played graphic intensive games. But, managed to come down to normal rapidly when the game was switched off.\n",
      "\n",
      "The sound quality of the phone is not as great as its sibling S8 Plus, but is loud for a single speaker phone. We recommend using the AKG headphones (supplied in the box) with this smartphone for better resonance. The voice quality on the other hand is top notch. The sound is crisp (on 4G) and one can hear the other person’s speech clearly.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "Yes, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 is slightly thicker than its brother the Galaxy S8 plus, mostly because it has to accommodate the S-pen. 3,300 mAh of battery juice provides just 22 hours of work time (nominal use with Wi-Fi on). Which is not so bad for a phone that has a larger-than-life smart screen and extended features. Overall, the Samsung Galaxy Note 8 with a price tag of Rs 67,900 is a worthy player in the premium segment of smartphones. \n",

      " Mar 29, 2019, 05:10PM IST\n",
      " We often say that two’s company, three’s a crowd. But not in Samsung’s case though. The South Korean conglomerate until now used its two-pronged strategy of Galaxy S and S Plus models every year. However, 2019 became the year when the handset maker expanded its S-series with the third smartphone, Samsung Galaxy S10e. The smartphone not just marks the debut of a new ‘e’ line up but aims at a crowd that wants the ‘flagship’ experience while being comfortable sacrificing certain features.\n",
      "\n",
      "And to be fair, the Galaxy S10e does make sense given the S10 and the S10+ are more powerful this time with their prices higher than before. With S10e, the company has tried keeping its feet firm in countries like India where price and affordability are key factors driving the sales of a smartphone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, being the smallest and the first flat-screen Galaxy S smartphone in three years, the Galaxy S10e, of course, is not as powerful on paper as it’s bigger screen siblings. But what it boils down at the end of the day is the ‘value’, something Samsung clearly wants to achieve with the Rs 55,900 priced Galaxy S10e. So has S10e managed to punch above its weight? Read the review below.\n",
      "\n",
      "DesignWe got our hands on the Black colour variant, which brings the appealing factor on board and rightfully justifies the Galaxy S line-up’s ‘premium’ tag in terms of looks. Samsung has once again played safe using the tried and tested glass back design with the camera set up in the middle and a metal chassis build. But that’s something you have seen already. What’s new, however, is how compact and ‘perfect’ the size of this handset is.\n",
      "\n",
      " Samsung Galaxy S10e is the first after the Galaxy S7 (2016) to sport such a form factor and we’re glad the company thought about it. It’s just so much easier to use and even easier to pull it out from your pocket and perform the task single-handedly. Add this with the One UI’s design of keeping the interactive elements towards the lower half of the screen, and you get a commendable device.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Samsung has done a good job with the S10e’s ergonomics, like any other smartphone, it’s not ‘perfect’ and you will have to sit through the flaws. The fingerprint-laden power button is on the top right corner while the volume buttons are on the top left. Both of them are pretty much inaccessible until unless you re-adjust your hand every time. We did find it bothersome and in an otherwise perfect-sized smartphone, this might be a major downside. Also, since both the volume and power buttons are placed opposite to each other, there’s a good chance of you pressing the other one accidentally.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On the brighter side though, you can swipe down on the fingerprint sensor to see the notification tray. Do it twice and the tray expands to show you all the options. We found it really nifty.\n",
      "\n",
      " Also, the smartphone has two speakers (kind of) this time. While one is down-firing, the second one (speaker grille placed above the screen) resonates the main, AKG-tuned one. They are loud and pretty impressive in terms of vocals and overall clarity in music.\n",
      "\n",
      "We’ve already mentioned the glass back panel, which usually makes the entire package look good but not always durable. We didn’t risk dropping our Galaxy S10e review unit but then looking at the materials that Samsung generally uses in its flagship smartphones, it is recommended to use a cover case. Samsung says both front and back sides are protected with Corning Gorilla Glass 5. So, it’s up to you if it worth risking or not. For what’s worth, we did feel the Galaxy S10e slightly slippery without the cover case that it comes without the box. \n",
      "\n",
      "DisplayHands-down, Samsung’s AMOLED displays have always nailed it regardless of the device. It throws out vibrant, saturated colours while maintaining deep Blacks. We do feel that Reds are a bit garish at times but for the most part, it’s a treat to your eyes. In Galaxy S10e’s case, what’s different this year is the punch-hole display design. Since the past couple of years, the smartphone screen segment has evolved leaps and bounds. As much as within two years we have seen 18:9 screens, displays with full-length notch, waterdrop notch, notch-less screens and screens with an integrated fingerprint sensor. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Samsung has followed what can be called as ‘keep calm and deliver the latest tech’ mantra. Until the Galaxy Note 9, the handset maker stayed with 18.5:9 aspect ratio AMOLED screen without a notch, minimizing top and bottom bezels equally. But with Galaxy S10e it directly brought the punch hole display. However, it did keep the notch-laden ‘Infinity U and V’ screens for mid-rangers.\n",
      "We find punch hole screens more engaging than the ones sporting a notch, specially while viewing content in the landscape mode. The top right corner can be easily ignored. The 5.8-inch canvas doesn’t seem like one when you use the handset. It looks much more compact. We did feel the need to resize the icon as they are standard across the Galaxy S10 and S10+ as well. But all in all, the ‘Infinity O’ screen looks beautiful. We can say that this is the closest Samsung has reached to make the screen bezels on all the four sides uniform. The 5.8-inch Super AMOLED screen packs 2280x1080 pixels and is HDR10+ certified so expect some mind-boggling viewing experience from this one. \n",
      "While that’s the hardware specs, on the software front you get the usual set of features including Blue light filter, ability to force apps to open in full screen, edge lighting, Always-on display and much more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yes, many may agree that a flat screen smartphone doesn’t fit as a ‘flagship sibling’ and that Samsung could’ve used a curved edge screen like what’s there in the S10 and the S10+. However, after using it for days, we can confirm it as one of the best flat-screen smartphones in the market right now.\n",
      "PerformanceIf you are spending Rs 55,900 on a smartphone that is also a sibling of the flagship of the year, you expect it to perform flawlessly even if it’s not as powerful. And the Galaxy S10e doesn’t disappoint. Like the Samsung Galaxy S10 and the S10 Plus, this too uses the prowess of Exynos 9820, which works in conjunction with Mali-G76 GPU. Adding this powerful combination with 6GB RAM simply makes the smartphone indomitable in the given segment if not less. If you think you need extra 2GB of RAM you can either go for the Galaxy S10 or the S10+. However, we still think that 6GB should be sufficient enough to implement most tasks.\n",
      "\n",
      "With that kind of serious tech, it’s difficult for the Galaxy S10e to backstab you while you are working on heavy apps simultaneously or even using them with split screen and streaming content in PiP mode. You can get the Qualcomm Snapdragon 855 version from the US and other select countries but for end users, there will hardly be a noticeable change. We feel the device is meant to just set up and forget once out of the box. Also, the 128GB inbuilt storage is not an issue since you get microSD card support, something which is rare in high-end smartphones these days.\n",
      " While that was for the hardware, Samsung’s user interface, OneUI is also a talking point here. Being fairly new, the Android 9 Pie, based OneUI is the most mature level of interface Samsung has right now and for the most part it does justice. We did mention above how OneUI works in tandem with the small screen and a compact form factor. But that’s not all. In addition to the interface design, OneUI is feature-rich and level of customisation you can do with the notifications panel, lock screen display and more can sometimes be overwhelming. There’s also gesture-based navigation now, which is easier to use once you get a hold of it. Personally, we liked the ‘dark mode’ or what Samsung calls ‘Night Mode’.\n",
      "\n",
      " Gaming gets better this time with Gaming Tools that control your calls, notifications, audio and other game features. As for heating, the issue isn’t really a part of the equation here given the high-end spec list and the advanced heat pipe cooling system, which is also there in the S10. The S10+ uses the better vapour chamber cooling system.\n",
      "While all these get a thumbs-up from us, Bixby stays the black sheep with Galaxy devices. We still find Google Assistant as the best assistant out there and Bixby is ‘galaxies’ away from reaching there. Sure, it does a good job in handling local contents and placing it on a single screen but we do feel it’s not at it’s ‘the best’ version yet as the experience still feels lacking.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "CameraIf you’ve haven’t already noticed, the Galaxy S10e has one less camera at the back as compared to the Galaxy S10 and the S10+. The dual rear camera setup excludes the telephoto lens but retains the 12MP wide-angle lens powered by dual pixel, AF and OIS features. It also has a pixel size of 1.4um, FOV of 77-degrees and dual aperture tech switching between f/1.5 and f/2.4. The second camera is the 16MP Ultra wide camera that has a pixel size of 1um, FOV of 123-degrees and f/2.2 aperture. While these metrics sound powerful enough to deliver exceptionally good images, in real life use they were not that impressive.\n",
      "While the images shot during daylight are crisp and vibrant, we found the handset at times over sharpening the subject. Of course, that’s not visible until unless you zoom and see it. In addition, the overall colour tone in images is warm, something that makes the resulting image appear far from true-to-life. You may also find the camera boosting the skin tone more towards yellow at times. But that’s something you won’t mind. To a regular user who wants the ‘Instagram’ material, the images look great.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The portraits shots on the other hand, have definitely improved since the Galaxy S9. We tried a lot of shots using the ‘Live focus’ mode and every time the performance was satisfactory is nothing less. It’s not as perfect as the Pixel smartphones but still comes close. As for the low light performance, we have mixed reactions as the handset, despite having a large 1.4um pixel size is not able to hide the noise completely and still makes night shots look a bit dull, specially the dark sky. But in artificial light conditions, it performs really well, balancing the colours and the highlights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Three major ‘Intelligence’ features powering the camera are Screen Optimiser, Shot suggestions and Flaw detection. These three worked well most of the times. We did see Flaw Detection failing to notice the person blinking in a single person shot. You may not even need all three of these in most cases but it’s appreciable to make its way in the Galaxy S10e anyway. And for those thinking about the third, telephoto camera, which is present in Galaxy S10 and the S10+, we didn’t really feel like missing out on much without it. Also, Samsung says that you do get 0.5x optical zoom and up to 8x digital zoom if that helps.\n",
      "\n",
      "The front-facing 10MP camera boasts of Dual Pixel AF, pixel size of 1.2um and FOV of 80-degrees with f/1.9 aperture, all of which work well for selfie lovers. Of course, it’s not the most natural looking selfie as it softens your skin and makes you look fairer with default settings, something which can be controlled if you tweak around a little bit. What’s good news is that the front camera supports wide angle view but unfortunately misses out on the details and the wide-angle view is also not a considerable one.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the camera user interface, although appearing cluttered with several buttons and functions on either side of the screen, makes them easy to access. There’s a floating shutter button as well that makes it easy to click selfies. It could’ve been appreciable if the UI was cleaner while keeping the basic features on screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "BatterySamsung Galaxy S10e’s 3100mAh battery may sound just enough to get the job done, in our usage, it didn’t. The smartphone did take a couple of days to learn the usage pattern, leaving us with some hope that the device might just end up having enough juice to run for 10 hours on an average. But on mixed usage, which includes everything from watching videos to playing PUBG and working on couple of apps simultaneously, our review unit delivered around 5-6 hours. That is not impressive given the amount you are spending for a smartphone that is still powerful if not anything less.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "That said, the handset is great for you if you are a light or an average user. On light use, which had us limited to checking our emails, streaming music for hours and browsing through social media apps, the smartphone gave us a total of 10 hours on an average with 5-6 hours screen on time constantly.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is worth adding that the ‘Adaptive power saving’ feature is switched off by default so we’d recommend you to switch it on once the handset has been set up to avoid unwanted battery drain. The feature comes in addition with three usual modes of Optimised (default), Medium power saving and Maximum power saving. The latter two cut the background app tasks, Always On display and limits the CPU speed up to 70% or more. These do come in handy in crucial situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VerdictSo what’s the gist with the Samsung Galaxy S10e? What’s the reason behind Samsung introducing this third smartphone in the flagship line up this year? After analysing the pros and cons of this Rs 55,900 smartphone, we can surely say that Samsung has aimed to deliver the ‘essentials’ of Galaxy S10 and the Galaxy S10+ at a price that is supposed to keep the handset maker’s feet firm in certain markets and is comparatively easy on your wallet. You don’t get all the features in this one but you do get what Samsung thinks people will look for if they are not in a mood to spend over Rs 60,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "You get a brilliant screen, a well-performing processor, average battery life, decent cameras and a whole lot of software-based features, which if you think about, don’t sound such a bad deal as a package. What, however, is the takeaway here is that Samsung has managed to deliver a much-required compact-sized powerful smartphone, something we were dying to see ever since the Sony Xperia ‘Compact’ smartphone series. The device, although having some flaws, keeps the key features intact and something customers would love to use. \n",
      "\n",
      "And in case you are a OnePlus 6T, Poco F1 or an Asus Zenfone 5Z user, for Rs 55,900 you get a way better AMOLED screen, amazing form factor and a feature-rich user OneUI. It’s not the ideal option if you plan to move on from Samsung Galaxy S9 or the Galaxy S9+ but for those sporting older Galaxy models or any smartphone from 2017, this could be it.\n",

      " Ten. There’s something about the number which clearly gets smartphone manufacturers’ creative juices flowing to do something special. Two years back Apple launched the iPhone X to mark 10 years of the iPhone and this year Samsung has marked the 10th year of its Galaxy Series with a splash of phones that have everyone sit up and take note (no pun intended). It is something that Samsung mobile division president DJ Koh also stressed on. Koh was categorical when he said that the year 2019 is going to be a game changer for the South Korean company in India. From launching the world’s largest mobile factory in Noida last year, Samsung has been upping the ante in the Indian market with a slew of devices. Along with launching three Galaxy S10 variants, the company has also recently launched the Galaxy M and A series in the affordable range. And not to forget, the Galaxy Fold--Samsung’s first foldable smartphone-- is also launching in India.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, before the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 arrives, the new Galaxy S10+ is the most powerful and advanced Samsung phone to buy. After using the Samsung Galaxy S10+ (8GB RAM/128GB) for a month, here is a detailed review of the phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Samsung Galaxy S10+ Design\n",
      "Just pick up the Galaxy S10+ and you feel class written all over it. While it looks heavy and big, the device is surprising light and fits well in the hands. Also, the new Galaxy S10+ is somewhat less curved on the sides and provides an incredible grip when compared to Galaxy S9+. \n",
      "\n",
      "Samsung Galaxy S10+ offers a brand new look and it will catch everyone’s attention, especially the dual punch holes on the display itself. With the Galaxy S10+, Samsung has made a big and bold design statement as it offers the best screen estate you can expect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Samsung has retained the goodness in the design from the older Galaxy S9+ and the solid metal frame gives it all the strength and character. Thankfully, the 3.5mm headphone jack has been retained. This is the tallest and heaviest of the Samsung Galaxy S10 models measuring 7.41x 15.76 x 0.78 cm and weighing 175 grams. Having said that it is great to hold but slightly large to fit inside your trouser pockets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rear of the Galaxy S10+ is made of glass and if you choose a dark colour then it entirely becomes a mirror. The White colour option – the one we got for review -- is not that reflective and looks really great. Overall, the build quality is nothing short of excellent. It’s a sturdy device and feels solid in the hands and appears undoubtedly premium. Interestingly, the Samsung Galaxy S10+ will easily manage to create a niche for itself in the Android crowd with its signature curves and dual punch hole display on the corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "At the back, the camera module is placed horizontally like it was in the Galaxy Note 9. With the fingerprint scanner on the display itself, the device easily differentiates from the other Galaxy phones. Not to forget, the little animation around the dual punch hole while you are using face unlock to use the device will win your heart.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Samsung Galaxy S10+ display\n",
      "To cut a long story short: this is arguably the best display you will ever find on any smartphone. It is a delight to watch movies or play games on the Galaxy S10+. The colours are accurate and the viewing angles are perfect. Samsung says that they have ensured ways to reduce blue light by default which is good news for those who indulge in long PUBG sessions. The Samsung Galaxy S10+ features a 6.4-inch Curved Dynamic AMOLED display with Quad HD+ resolution and 19:9 aspect ratio. It’s a punch hole display (fitting in two front cameras) with a minimal bezels. Samsung claims the device to offer incredible sunlight legibility with a pixel density of 522ppi. Other display features include HDR10+ certification along with in-built blue light reduction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Display: Notch vs punch hole-- which is better?\n",
      "While people are used to seeing the notch on their smartphones now and have adjusted to it, a dual punch hole display most certainly will raise eyebrows. Of course, having a full view display without the notch or hole is desirable but you will be surprised to find that the dual punch hole will not bug you at all. In fact, you might start liking it as it offers a more immersive experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Samsung Galaxy S10+, there is the option to open all apps in full screen mode or opt for a black bar along with dual punch hole. The best part is you can select which apps you want to open on full screen or not. To get the best experience of the display, it is recommended you open all apps on the full screen view. We tried playing games like PUBG Mobile, Asphalt along with watching videos and movies on the full screen and the dual punch hole did not create a problem at all. In fact, all the apps seemed to be automatically optimised to not have any crucial content getting hidden by the holes. The experience is like how TV channels put their logos on the screen. We all know that the TV channel logos are there but we don’t bother about it, do we?\n",

      "Samsung Galaxy S10+: What do you get out-of-the-box?\n",
      "The Samsung Galaxy S10+ comes with a screen guard and transparent back cover to protect the device out-of-the-box. You will also get AKG earphones along with a Type C to Type A adapter, Type C to microUSB adapter, charging/ data cable and a charging adapter. While the screen guard you get out-of-the-box is good to use but in case if you wish to put a tempered glass or any other screen protector then be sure to check whether that will work with the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner or not. The phone is IP68 water resistant and you do not need to put any other waterproof casing for the same.\n",

      "Samsung Galaxy S10+ performance\n",
      "The Samsung Galaxy S10+ is a power house. It is powered by a 2.7 GHz octa-core Exynos 9820 (8nm) processor (in India). The Galaxy S10+ is available with either 8GB of RAM or 12GB of RAM in internal storage options of 128GB, 256GB and 1TB respectively. All the variants support microSD cards of up to 512GB. We reviewed the entry-level 8GB RAM/128GB storage version and it is quite debatable as to whether you seriously need 12GB RAM or not. Remember, the only difference between an 8GB RAM and a 12GB RAM phone is the app loading and opening time. For example, if with 8GB of RAM, PUBG Mobile takes barely a second to open, with 12GB RAM it would take 0.8 seconds to open. That is all the major performance difference you would feel. As far as storage is concerned, it totally depends on how much you would need. Having said that the inbuilt storage will always be faster than the microSD.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s a very smooth device and you will not face any lags or stutters. But the device does get heated during long PUBG sessions. Switching to performance mode in battery settings would help a bit to control the temperature and will also give a sudden boost. However, in performance mode, the battery time will get reduced.\n",
      "\n",
      " As far as overall performance is concerned, this is one such smartphone you will feel like revving to maximum. Our daily routine with the Galaxy S10+ has been shooting videos and photos, editing videos, binge watching TV series, watch UHD movies, playing long hours of PUBG Mobile or Asphalt, video chatting with friends, taking work calls and more. But haven’t faced any hiccup during a month of usage and we are yet to switch off the phone once. Having said that, a power bank was always there with us, just in case.\n",

      "The Galaxy S10+ houses a superior camera offering incredible shots in almost all lighting conditions. We tried to compare the night mode capabilities of the Galaxy S10+ with the Google Pixel 3 XL and Huawei Mate 20 Pro in an almost dark room. While the Google Pixel 3 XL and Samsung Galaxy S10+ managed to deliver similar results, the Huawei Mate 20 Pro fell short by a bit. Having said that expect photos to be grainy in mixed coloured lighting situations. There is no dedicated night mode in the Galaxy S10+ and automatically scene detection enables it when required. This is one of the best cameras found in any Samsung phone and you will be surprised by its capabilities.\n",

      "Now, talking about the camera hardware, the Galaxy S10+ can be seen as having the dual-lens camera of the Galaxy Note 9 along with an additional ultra-wide angle lens. While the ultra-wide angle lens is a delight to use, it will disappoint you in low-lighting conditions.\n",

The primary sensor is the 12MP 2PD A/F wide-angle with dual OIS of f/1.5 and f/2.4. There is OIS support as well with 77 degree field of view. The primary sensor is location in the middle. The second sensor is 16MP fixed focus ultra-wide sensor with a 123 degree field of view and f/2.2 aperture. The third sensor is a 12MP AF telephoto sensor with f/2.4 aperture and OIS and 45 degree field of view. The Galaxy S10+ camera supports 0.5X/2X optical zoom and up to 10X digital zoom. \n",

But if you play games like PUBG Mobile a lot or binge watch multimedia content then be ready to charge your phone twice a day. There are different power modes to optimise battery to give you maximum juice but then these modes cuts down on performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is nothing much of a tangible change in battery charging time despite having Fast Charging 2.0. And this could frustrate users easily.

Samsung seriously needs to take some inspiration from OnePlus and work on introducing a worthy competitor to the Dash or Warp Charging technology. \n",

The One UI interface does a great job in making things look easy to use. There’s good news for those who hate the Bixby button. You can now remap it to launch any other app except Google Assistant. So, you can convert the Bixby button now to a dedicated Camera button or even a PUBG button. One press and the desired app will instantly open.\n",

      "The Galaxy S10+ comes with an in-display ultrasonic fingerprint scanner and it is the fastest of the lot. If you are using a screen guard, then don’t forget to increase the touch sensitivity of the phone to optimise the fingerprint sensor. There is no dedicated iris scanner but you can use face unlock to open the device. As far as the face unlock feature is concerned, note that it not the safest bet. The device can be unlocked by someone else when the user has got his/her eyes shut, like while sleeping. \n",

      "Samsung Galaxy S10+ review verdict\n",
      "You feel like spending something around Rs 75,000 on your new smartphone? And with this kind of budget, you are most likely inclined to buy the latest Apple iPhones. But let's see, the iPhone XR (64GB storage) at Rs 69,999 is a downright ‘compromise’ as the iPhone XS and XS Max seems overpriced in India. So, if not the latest iPhones, you can either consider the older iPhone X or perhaps look at good Android options like Google Pixel 3XL (4GB RAM/ 128GB) storage at a discounted price of Rs 77,999, Huawei Mate 20 Pro (6GB/128GB storage) at a discounted price of Rs 64,990 and a slighter more value-for-money option like the OnePlus 6T (8GB RAM/ 256GB storage) at Rs 45,999.\n",
      "\n",
      "No doubt that Samsung has positioned the new Galaxy S10+ perfectly in the Indian flagship market in terms of pricing. And not to forget this time, the company has given a lot of options to choose from like the Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10e.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Galaxy S10+ excels in design, display quality, performance and software experience. As far as the battery is concerned, quite frankly, there is very little useful battery innovation in the Galaxy S10+ that could beat the OnePlus 6T.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as the camera is concerned, overall, the Galaxy S10+ offers similar image quality when compared to the Pixel 3XL, including night mode. It offers more natural images than the Huawei Mate 20 Pro but what makes the camera of the Galaxy S10+ stand apart are the ultra-wide angle shots. Also, videos recorded on the Galaxy S10+ are way more stable than before.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Samsung Galaxy S10+ is a class apart and a beauty in itself. It could very well be called the best Android phone of 2019. Having said that we will still have to wait for the 2019 iPhones, Pixel 4 series and the Galaxy Note 10, of course. Till then, this may very well be the best Android phone money can buy. Samsung clearly has a winner on its hands.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, let’s start with the rundown of the specifications. The Samsung S8 is available in three colours in India—blue, gold and black. Inside, it has 4 GB RAM, 64 GB memory (expandable by 256 GB via a microSD card) backed by Exynos 8895 chip that has an octa-core CPU (4 cores x 2.3 GHz plus 4 cores x 1.7 GHz) and Mali G71 graphics unit.

      "That said, however, the Samsung S8 Plus does not compromise on power. We ran the Antutu Benchmark, where it scored 1,55,264 points and on Geekbench it scored 2,009 points (single core), 6,351 points (multi core) and 8,509 points in the computing test. All of them did not put it on the top of the list, but amongst the top four players in the market (behind the iPhone 7 Plus and One plus 3T). \n",
      "\n",
      "Switching gears, let’s talk about the brilliant display. Here is where all the magic happens. The infinity display (as Samsung calls it) on the Samsung S8 Plus is breath taking. The colours are very vibrant and close to life. Even at 30% brightness the screen does not disappoint—you just want to sit and stare (or even gawk) at it. Viewing angles are great and the curved glass does not disrupt the viewing experience. The screen colours do not wash under the sun if you are at 50% brightness, but do suffer slightly when below that. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We played quite a few videos on it, some from YouTube and we got to know why Samsung is asking for a premium for this device. The YT and other videos can be stretched to fill the screen completely. Coupled with the lurid loudspeaker or the in box AKG ear plugs, the experience is out of this world. Yes, since Samsung has acquired Harman Kardon (makers of AKG and JBL), we did have a hint that a good pair of earphones will come from this camp with the S8 Plus. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on, Samsung has put two great cameras in the Samsung S8 Plus built with dual pixel technology. First up, the 12 MP AF F1.7 lens at the rear. It is currently the best in the category. We loved every click and it hardly ever gave a noisy shot or a shot that we did not like because of the colours. In fact, both the cameras on the Samsung S8 Plus produce colours close to life. The clarity is outstanding. Lot of modes like Pro, Panorama and slow motion are available. Along with that picture effects and stickers exist too, which are quite fun to use. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, if you want to switch between the cameras, all you have to do is swipe up or down in the camera app and the system automatically switches between the two. The selfies did not disappoint either, especially when we used couple of stickers on it. Another segment where the cameras (of the Samsung S8 Plus) excel is the low-light or night shots. Thanks to the dual pixel tech in it, we could squeeze next to best shots at night as well as in rooms where there was less light. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The rear camera is also capable of capturing videos in 4K at 30FPS. Here the quality was superb. The front shooter can capture videos at 1,440 pixels and the quality is not bad either. It is only when you step into low lit areas, does the quality go down, a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the operating system, Samsung has given the latest Android N OS on the Samsung S8 Plus with its own enhancements. Setting it up was quite easy, just keep the Wi-Fi password handy and you will be fine. The home screen is clean and has the Bixby assistant (voice commands coming soon), which can be brought up by swiping right on the display. \n",
      "\n",
      "The users can customise it to quite an extent and add more cards that will show content from various news agencies, Facebook, Twitter et al. Bixby vision is also available on the Samsung S8 Plus, it reads QR codes, shows details about nearby locations/monuments using four square, tells you everything about a wine, translates text and much more. Just turn on the Bixby vision mode in the camera app and you are ready to point and know. It worked well most of the times, but did give us few erratic results when translating long sentences.\n",

      "The apps edge makes an appearance here too and one can add frequently used apps along with the list of usually called contacts. At first glance, it may seem like there is no app drawer in the phone, but you will soon find one. It can be accessed by swiping on the homescreen from the middle. There is no bloatware as such on the Samsung S8 Plus. However, the company does provide the users with software such as Samsung Pay and Office. The DEX attachment is also available at additional cost. This enables the user to connect a USB keyboard and mouse to it and turn the Samsung S8 Plus into a PC (connected to a HDMI enabled monitor or TV). \n",
      "\n",
      "Split screen features have also been added to the device. These can be accessed by pressing the opened apps button next to the home button. Users can choose the size by sliding the middle blue splitter up or down. This tool comes handy when you are watching something and get a message you must reply to, or when you are working on a document and want to access data from an e-mail. Other interesting features include Blue light filter, edge lighting for notifications, performance mode (for gaming, entertainment etc) and power saving settings. These can be accessed in the drop-down menu. \n",
      "\n",
      "To further test it, we ran some graphic intensive games and heavier apps on the Samsung S8 Plus. At no point in our review did the smartphone become hot, even after two hours of continuous gaming. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice quality was superb as well. We were on the 4G network and faced no troubles. Which brings us to Battery Life. Our day was filled with a number of voice calls, Whatsapp messages and Wi-Fi was turned on for lengthy periods, all of it at 50% screen brightness. We did sneak in a YouTube video or two as well and still were left with 30% battery juice at the end of the day. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is not bad for a smartphone that has 3,500 mAh battery inside with quick charge feature. Not once did we feel that we have to bring out the power bank or scramble for the charger. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VerdictThe Samsung S8 Plus is dust and water resistant up to 1.5 meters. Which does check the box for underwater photography. However, the bigger picture here is that if the user drops water or coffee on it, the smartphone will still work. On the flipside, if you drop it on concrete from a height, chances are you will shatter the front or rear glass or both. So, our suggestion is to buy a case or a bumper panel for it as soon as you purchase it. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, does it make sense to pick it up at Rs 64,900? The number of features Samsung is giving in the S8 Plus is mind boggling. It is the Ferrari of Android Smartphones and impressed us at various levels. Our only apprehension was the Exynos chipset, but that too did not dissatisfy. Though, we still maintain that it could have been better if the Qualcomm chipset was available in India as well. Closest competition is the iPhone 7 Plus that is slightly more expensive and has dual rear cameras. \n",

The front side also has the Iris sensor (which works at blitzkrieg speeds) along with an 8MP AF camera. The onscreen home key, back and currently opened apps button get camouflaged at the bottom. When the middle part of the screen at the bottom is hard pressed for the home key there is a haptic feedback, too. So, the user always knows he or she is pressing the right button. \n",
      "\n",
      "Turn it around and one finds the 12 MP AF camera with single colour LED flash on one side and a fingerprint sensor on the other. It opens the phone very quickly, but the placement of this sensor could have been better. Samsung branding is under it, which gets a little lost on the black shell. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PerformanceThis is what we love about flagships, the firms try to give as many features as possible in a device. Yes, this increases the price, but in the end (more often than not) it is value for money. So far, the Samsung S8 Plus seemed to be on the path to glory, but many and the mightiest have fallen face-down on our test bench, here’s how this one fared. \n",
      "\n",
      "First, let’s start with the rundown of the specifications. The Samsung S8 is available in three colours in India—blue, gold and black. Inside, it has 4 GB RAM, 64 GB memory (expandable by 256 GB via a microSD card) backed by Exynos 8895 chip that has an octa-core CPU (4 cores x 2.3 GHz plus 4 cores x 1.7 GHz) and Mali G71 graphics unit. Unfortunately, only the US models have Qualcomm chipsets. Together they are not the best available out there, but do make a premium device. We would have appreciated if the Qualcomm chipset would have been available for the Indian users as well. \n",

      "             vs Apple iPhone 7 Plus Full Comparison\n",
      "    \n",
      "\n",
      "That said, however, the Samsung S8 Plus does not compromise on power. We ran the Antutu Benchmark, where it scored 1,55,264 points and on Geekbench it scored 2,009 points (single core), 6,351 points (multi core) and 8,509 points in the computing test. All of them did not put it on the top of the list, but amongst the top four players in the market (behind the iPhone 7 Plus and One plus 3T). \n",
      "\n",
      "Switching gears, let’s talk about the brilliant display. Here is where all the magic happens. The infinity display (as Samsung calls it) on the Samsung S8 Plus is breath taking. The colours are very vibrant and close to life. Even at 30% brightness the screen does not disappoint—you just want to sit and stare (or even gawk) at it. Viewing angles are great and the curved glass does not disrupt the viewing experience. The screen colours do not wash under the sun if you are at 50% brightness, but do suffer slightly when below that. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We played quite a few videos on it, some from YouTube and we got to know why Samsung is asking for a premium for this device. The YT and other videos can be stretched to fill the screen completely. Coupled with the lurid loudspeaker or the in box AKG ear plugs, the experience is out of this world. Yes, since Samsung has acquired Harman Kardon (makers of AKG and JBL), we did have a hint that a good pair of earphones will come from this camp with the S8 Plus. \n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on, Samsung has put two great cameras in the Samsung S8 Plus built with dual pixel technology. First up, the 12 MP AF F1.7 lens at the rear. It is currently the best in the category. We loved every click and it hardly ever gave a noisy shot or a shot that we did not like because of the colours. In fact, both the cameras on the Samsung S8 Plus produce colours close to life. The clarity is outstanding. Lot of modes like Pro, Panorama and slow motion are available. Along with that picture effects and stickers exist too, which are quite fun to use. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Further, if you want to switch between the cameras, all you have to do is swipe up or down in the camera app and the system automatically switches between the two. The selfies did not disappoint either, especially when we used couple of stickers on it. Another segment where the cameras (of the Samsung S8 Plus) excel is the low-light or night shots. Thanks to the dual pixel tech in it, we could squeeze next to best shots at night as well as in rooms where there was less light. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The rear camera is also capable of capturing videos in 4K at 30FPS. Here the quality was superb. The front shooter can capture videos at 1,440 pixels and the quality is not bad either. It is only when you step into low lit areas, does the quality go down, a bit.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the operating system, Samsung has given the latest Android N OS on the Samsung S8 Plus with its own enhancements. Setting it up was quite easy, just keep the Wi-Fi password handy and you will be fine. The home screen is clean and has the Bixby assistant (voice commands coming soon), which can be brought up by swiping right on the display. \n",
      "\n",
      "The users can customise it to quite an extent and add more cards that will show content from various news agencies, Facebook, Twitter et al. Bixby vision is also available on the Samsung S8 Plus, it reads QR codes, shows details about nearby locations/monuments using four square, tells you everything about a wine, translates text and much more. Just turn on the Bixby vision mode in the camera app and you are ready to point and know. It worked well most of the times, but did give us few erratic results when translating long sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The apps edge makes an appearance here too and one can add frequently used apps along with the list of usually called contacts. At first glance, it may seem like there is no app drawer in the phone, but you will soon find one. It can be accessed by swiping on the homescreen from the middle. There is no bloatware as such on the Samsung S8 Plus. However, the company does provide the users with software such as Samsung Pay and Office. The DEX attachment is also available at additional cost. This enables the user to connect a USB keyboard and mouse to it and turn the Samsung S8 Plus into a PC (connected to a HDMI enabled monitor or TV). \n",
      "\n",
      "Split screen features have also been added to the device. These can be accessed by pressing the opened apps button next to the home button. Users can choose the size by sliding the middle blue splitter up or down. This tool comes handy when you are watching something and get a message you must reply to, or when you are working on a document and want to access data from an e-mail. Other interesting features include Blue light filter, edge lighting for notifications, performance mode (for gaming, entertainment etc) and power saving settings. These can be accessed in the drop-down menu. \n",
      "\n",
      "To further test it, we ran some graphic intensive games and heavier apps on the Samsung S8 Plus. At no point in our review did the smartphone become hot, even after two hours of continuous gaming. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The voice quality was superb as well. We were on the 4G network and faced no troubles. Which brings us to Battery Life. Our day was filled with a number of voice calls, Whatsapp messages and Wi-Fi was turned on for lengthy periods, all of it at 50% screen brightness. We did sneak in a YouTube video or two as well and still were left with 30% battery juice at the end of the day. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is not bad for a smartphone that has 3,500 mAh battery inside with quick charge feature. Not once did we feel that we have to bring out the power bank or scramble for the charger. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VerdictThe Samsung S8 Plus is dust and water resistant up to 1.5 meters. Which does check the box for underwater photography. However, the bigger picture here is that if the user drops water or coffee on it, the smartphone will still work. On the flipside, if you drop it on concrete from a height, chances are you will shatter the front or rear glass or both. So, our suggestion is to buy a case or a bumper panel for it as soon as you purchase it. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, does it make sense to pick it up at Rs 64,900? The number of features Samsung is giving in the S8 Plus is mind boggling. It is the Ferrari of Android Smartphones and impressed us at various levels. Our only apprehension was the Exynos chipset, but that too did not dissatisfy. Though, we still maintain that it could have been better if the Qualcomm chipset was available in India as well. Closest competition is the iPhone 7 Plus that is slightly more expensive and has dual rear cameras. \n",

      " It was Albert Einstein who said, “if at first the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it.” In the world of technology, it’s all about ideas and innovation and truth is that products we use on a daily basis would’ve seemed absurd a while. But to leave a mark in a competitive market – like the Indian smartphone space – it’s critical to be innovative. Take the case of Vivo, a brand that seems to be adopting an innovative and aggressive strategy. \n",
      "\n",
      "The popular Chinese handset maker is leaving no stone unturned when it comes to showing off the bandwidth of innovation it is doing behind the scenes to make more customers swing towards it. We have seen in-screen fingerprint sensors, pop-up front-facing cameras and other technology in \n",
      "Vivo smartphones getting unveiled globally but India, being one of the biggest markets, seem to remain the focus of the company. Few weeks ago it launched the Vivo X21 in the country, making it one of the first smartphones with an on-screen fingerprint scanner in India. Now, it has debuted the ‘Nex’ brand in India with its flagship model – Vivo Nex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivo Nex is one of those handsets that seem to have all the newest tech on board and sport flagship-level specifications, at least on paper. But is it the case in reality as well? Is this Rs 44,990 smartphone worth the price tag it carries? We have been using the smartphone since past one week and here’s our review.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Design\n",
      "\n",
      "The first thought that comes to our mind while holding the Vivo Nex is that it is one of the heavyweights out there. There are several reasons for it. First being the large screen and hence the footprint of the smartphone itself. Then comes the massive 4000mAh battery and finally a small percentage coming from the pop-up camera mechanism. Although being heavy, it still maintains the balance while working single-handedly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nex is not the slimmest but it sure is thin enough to make it feel premium. Sides at the back are curved towards the screen, giving it a sharp edge, which in turn makes it easy to hold. Although the front is nothing but all screen, the back has a textured look that makes it appear premium to some extent. The metal build could understandably be the main reason for the heaviness of the smartphone.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the flip side, there are a couple of cons here which one won’t be able to ignore. Since it has an elevated camera that jumps on you once you take a selfie, the device is not water resistant or even dust resistant for that matter. So use it carefully. The complex machinery working inside the smartphone also makes it fragile to some extent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another feature missing here is the wireless charging. But you won’t be needing it as it is. We’ll explain why when we talk about the battery in detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "However, what you may find different with the Vivo Nex is that it has a dedicated button the left side to trigger Google Assistant. All you need to do is to long press it. We found it a handy addition as there are several things that one needs to search in their everyday lives. Bringing the search level one level above is the Google Lens integration that fires upon a single press. On the right side you have power and volume buttons. These are quite prominent to recognise so it won’t be difficult to handle the device on the whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the lower end you get a Type-C charging port along with a mono speaker and a microSD or SIM card slot on either side. While we have seen several flagships ditching the 3.5mm headphone jack, Vivo seems to be sticking with the traditional port with Nex, which should come as bliss for several users who are finding it hard to adapt to a Type-C port audio connector.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, the smartphone has a ‘solid’ and robust feel to it, assuring you a certain level of durability and premium-ness. Its heavy for sure but that is likely to grow on you over time. Besides the design, what may catch your attention is the display. We’ll explain why.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Display\n",
      "\n",
      "Like we mentioned above, Vivo is focussing on bringing innovation to the hands of regular customers this year and a glimpse of it was seen in the form of an on-screen fingerprint sensor with the Vivo X21. Now, the same feature comes as a part of the Vivo Nex display. Not only you get a fingerprint sensor embedded on the screen but also a near bezel-less panel. And from bezel-less we mean no-notches anywhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 6.59-inch Super Amoled FHD+ (2316x1080 pixels) is a bliss to look at. The colours are vibrant, saturated and the blacks are deep. While the three sides are virtually bezel-free, the fourth side (below the screen) can be seen with slightly more chin than the rest of the sides. This is still impressive given that the ones found on other flagships are still more. Vivo is claiming to have achieved 91% screen-to-body ratio with the Nex.\n",
      "\n",
      "For us it is one of the most immersive displays in a smartphone. No matter if you’re playing PubG on a full-screen mode or binge-watching Sacred Games on Netflix, the large display with no disturbances (we’re talking about the notch) looks great. Since its an AMOLED screen with FHD+ resolution, it also saves a lot on the battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The brightness levels are good as they make the content on the screen bright and clear when in broad daylight. In addition to this you get a Blue light filter in the form of ‘Eye Protection’ and Always On display to tell you the time at all times.\n",
      "\n",
      "So the Vivo Nex gets a thumbs up from us in the display section. Although everything looks good, the on-screen fingerprint sensor is still slow and not as fast as the one embedded on the back or below the screen in some handsets. But we are hoping that will get quicker with time. Enough of design and display starters, now let's get to the main course - Performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance\n",
      "\n",
      "The Nex is a powerhouse when it comes to performance - this is something anybody would think as the smartphone packs the flagship mobile processor of 2018, Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 processor. Fortunately, it sure is a powerhouse as it handles apps and heavy graphic-intensive games easily. Just for the sake of testing its capabilities, we ran PubG on the smartphone, while having Mortal Kombat, Google Chrome, YouTube and Google Maps with navigation opened in the background. Not once did it lag or showed any signs of stuttering. Of course it does reload the app after a certain point but does a commendable job overall. While the major credit for this goes to the processor, it also goes to the ample 8GB RAM.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since you get the processor of ‘flagships’ working behind the curtains along with 8GB RAM, it churns a lot of power heating the device. Although Vivo has not detailed the mechanism it uses in Nex to keep it cooled down, it works just fine. While working on multiple apps there was not a single instance when we felt the device is heating up. It does get slightly warm while charging.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, performance doesn’t just include the processing performance and heat dissipation but everything from the user interface to all those nifty little features that make them unique. Nex runs on company's FunTouch OS v4.0 which is based on Android 8.0 Oreo. Although there is nothing wrong with the UI. You get all the Android goodies with a different interface. If you are coming from a different UI-laden smartphone, this won’t come as something different. However, you may find it cleaner than before. Some may say that certain designs made in the UI match that of iOS but it is more customisable and gives you more features at your fingertips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since this is the company’s marvel device to showcase the innovations, we are expecting Vivo to speed up the OS update cycle and be regular with the Nex in bringing the latest OS versions on board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other than regular users, gamers too may find the Nex of some interest. The dedicated game mode brings nifty tricks such as floating call alerts at the top of the screen, answering the call in the background with the game being prioritised on the screen, auto gaming mode and more. Auto gaming mode makes it possible to keep the game running in the background even if the screen is locked. The Game Assistant will give you shortcuts to different game functions. Both of these will be coming in future updates though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among other features that you will find in competitive devices priced slightly lower such as OnePlus 6, you will also find swipeable navigation gestures, screen gestures to open apps directly from the lock screen, raise the smartphone to wake, double tap to wake and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Also worth talking about is the hidden audio system that comes in to play when you answer a call. Virtually, there is no visible speaker as the audio resonates through the screen and reaches you. This definitely gets a point but on the flipside – it needs to improve. For the most part it works fine. However, at times we found ourselves struggling to hear audio as it reaches the ear all muffled. We hope Vivo takes care of this in the future. For most of us coming from any other smartphones, except for Xiaomi Mi Mix devices, it will feel weird initially as you won’t find anything to stick your ear on to. But it grows on you over time.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, if you look at it on a larger level, overall performance is not so bad after all because you get all the features mixed with some uniqueness. We just want to add that there is still some room for improvement in certain areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Camera\n",
      "\n",
      "The camera is another section in the Nex that we found different. The front-facing pop-up camera is no doubt fascinating and futuristic to look at. Like we said in our first impressions, you will end up playing with it more than you actually click a selfie. It jumps on you as soon as you open the front camera via an app. It does take microseconds extra top pop up and show your face on the screen but that’s understandable and a small price that you have to pay to get a bezel-less screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a major concern though. Since it is a retractable component and is often subject to get exposed while clicking selfie shots, there is a constant fear of it taking dust and moisture inside the device, harming it eventually. One would have to use it carefully though.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, the front camera performance should be just about perfect for a selfie lover. It has all the features such as portrait effect, HDR, Selfie lighting effects, Live Photo and Face Beauty. The resulting images from the 8MP sensor with f/2.0 aperture do look sharp on a small screen but you could easily make out the slight yet unnatural smoothening of the skin.\n",
      "\n",
      "We found the rear camera performance really good. The smartphone has a dual rear camera setup consisting of a 12MP sensor with f/1.8 aperture along with a 5MP sensor with f/2.4 aperture. The images are impressively sharp and the autofocus is something you can count upon. One can rely on the Nex’s camera performance in tricky lighting situations and even in low light. Noise is minimal and blacks actually look black and not a lighter shade of it. At times you can get glare if there’s a brighter light source but it is not that big of a deal as the colours stay close to what you see in real life.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The portrait mode works as expected. It is difficult to place it up against the likes of Google Pixel 2 smartphones or the iPhone X when it comes to portrait shots. But it still manages to sail through.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition you get features like Live Photo, HDR, Times Lapse, Panorama along with AR Stickers, which is another fun element to play around with. The interface is clean and the settings section opens on the screen while the camera is activated in the background.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some may like it but then you may have to struggle to see what’s there on the screen at times as the subject can be different or moving in the background, hindering with what you see on the screen. What is also an issue being that on rotating the screen to landscape mode, the settings drop-down text and icons stay in the portrait mode while the icons for shutter button, HDR, Portrait and others on the side rotate accordingly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nonetheless, the camera is full of features. You can click in different aspect ratios, shoot 4K videos as well. A trade-off here is that 4K videos can’t be shot in 60fps, nor can full-HD videos. The slow-motion videos however can be shot in HD and full-HD resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "See some of the test shots from Vivo Nex, here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Battery\n",
      "\n",
      "Battery is one of the areas where the Nex shines. Its 4000mAh battery can make the handset last easily for 12 hours on a single charge. This includes everything from gaming to streaming music, watching videos and working on heavy apps while others running in the background. The ‘dual-engine’ fast charging tech also works well as the handset’s battery charge shoots up drastically in first 20 minutes, making it reach around 50%. However, the charging rate goes down while covering the remaining charge. The last 10% takes the most time. For end users, this shouldn’t be an issue as they get most juice in lesser time. The mechanism can’t be compared with OnePlus’ Dash Charge but it sure is impressive. The handset supports 22W fast charging.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can even switch the battery usage mode from ‘Normal’ to ‘Low Power’, which as expected reduces the CPU and GPU frequency and also reduces the screen brightness. Wireless networks like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are also disabled in order to extend the battery life. There is also a ‘Super Power-Saving’ mode that essentially enables the Contacts, Phone, Messages and Clock applications. What’s interesting here is that the Battery section in the Settings app lets you keep a check on the power consuming apps as well and lets you allow apps as per your choice that can have high background power consumption.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivo Nex is one bold step by the firm, which is not as popular as Samsung or Apple, in a country which also happens to be one of the top smartphone markets in the world. The brand definitely has a name and is also one of the only firms to bring innovations right at the palm of an Indian. However, users may find it slightly sceptical to spend Rs 44, 990 initially. There are a lot of pros with the Nex. It gives you a notch-less, virtually bezel-less display along with an on-screen fingerprint sensor that’s a part of innovation but can still be improved. Not to forget the cool camera pop up mechanism that may seem like a gimmick but is thankfully more than that. You get the top of the line processor, ample RAM, amazing battery life and a great Super AMOLED screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the flipside you have a heavy smartphone that is not dust or water resistant. It is also fragile to some extent and the cover case options may not be much. For the given price the smartphone seems justifiable. However, it would’ve been an absolute steal deal if it was available for under Rs 40,000 mark, giving a tough time to its sister firm OnePlus. For now, the Nex is a smartphone that you can flaunt around boasting all the innovations that it has under one roof.\n",

      " It was Albert Einstein who once said that “the person who follows the crowd will usually go no further than the crowd. The person who walks alone is likely to find himself in places no one has ever seen before.” Einstein’s quote fits quite aptly in the smartphone industry where a lot of brands fall in the trap of following what others are actually doing. Vivo, however, is a brand that has made some attempts to be “different”. With its Vivo Nex smartphone, the Chinese brand got the first device to feature a pop-up selfie camera. And now with its Vivo V15 and Vivo V15 Pro, the company has added an in-display fingerprint sensor and the pop-up camera to mid-range devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Priced at Rs 23,990 the Vivo V15 seems like promising smartphone, at least on paper. But does it actually have that performance and features to justify its price? We got a chance to use the smartphone for quite some time and here’s what we have to say in our detailed review:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivo V15: Design\n",
      "As soon as we unboxed the smartphone, the first thing that grabbed our attention was its striking multi-colour gradient back panel. The smartphone comes in three colour options -- Royal Blue, Glamour Red and Frozen Black. Our unit is Glamour Red and we have to admit it looks as premium as some of the other premium smartphones from the company.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the smartphone looks like any other Vivo smartphone available in the market. The front has a virtually bezel-less display and nothing else. Virtually because the smartphone still retains a relatively thick chin compared to other three sides of the screen. The back gets vertically stacked triple-rear camera setup placed at the top-left along with a fingerprint scanner while the Vivo logo towards the bottom of the smartphone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main reasons behind Vivo being able to eliminate the notch from its smartphone is its pop-up selfie camera which is placed at the top edge of the smartphone just above the rear camera housing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The right side of the phone has the volume rocker and power button, while the SIM card tray and a dedicated assistant button is placed at the left of the device.\n",
      "\n",
      " At the bottom, there's a speaker grille, micro USB port for charging and 3.5mm audio jack.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the company has done a good job in terms of design, the smartphone feels premium and fit and finish is also quite good considering the price. The smartphone is not the most comfortable device to hold but at least its not slippery and provides a firm grip while holding the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivo V15: Display\n",
      "Since last year, Vivo has launched several smartphones with ‘waterdrop’ notch as well as bezel-less screens and Vivo has done the same by adding the sliding camera mechanism to Vivo V15. The smartphone features a 6.53-inch Ultra FullView display with FHD+ (2340×1080 pixels) resolution screen which has a 91.6% screen-to-body ratio. The display also gets the Corning Gorilla Glass 5 protection that adds to the durability of the screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The three sides of the screen have almost identical thin bezels, however bottom chin is still there but that won't bother much in day-to-day usage because the display is really good and it gets bright enough to be visible even bright sunlight. The display offers good colour production as well as reasonably good clarity as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the slightly bigger chin at the bottom, the Vivo V15 is a great device for watching videos and even gaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from this, features like auto-brightness, eye-protection, colour temperature control and ability to resize any app to the given resolution for the apps to cover the entire area of the screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, we don’t have any complaints related to the display with Vivo V15.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivo V15: Performance\n",
      "In terms of performance, the smartphone comes with MediaTek Helio P70 processor coupled with 6GB RAM and 64GB of onboard storage. The Helio P70 is the mid-range processor from the company which offers satisfactory performance as well as battery life. Having said that, the smartphone is capable enough to run almost anything from apps, manage multiple browser tabs or anything else without any significant lag or stuttering. During our test, we tested several resource hungry apps and the device managed them really well. However, a few heavy apps took a little longer to load but for most of the apps like Facebook, Browser, etc the load time was just fine and there’s nothing much to say about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smartphone also performed really well while switching between apps and navigation courtesy to 6GB of RAM. But when it comes to storage, the smartphone does come with 64GB onboard memory which might be sufficient for many, but the lack of memory card slot might be an issue for some.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the impressive parts of Helio processors are there’s a lot less heating issue compared to its rivals and that reflects with this V-series smartphone as well even with heavy apps the device was comfortable to hold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Things are a little different when it comes to the gaming performance of the phone. Basic games like Subway Surfer, Candy Crush, etc ran just fine. However, users might have to tone down the graphics settings for triple-A title games like PUBG and Asphalt 9, etc to make it run smoothly on the smartphone. To make things better, the Vivo V15 also comes with Game Mode 5.0 that is aimed to provide overall smooth gaming performance and reduce frame drops while gaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about software, the Vivo V15 runs on company’s FunTouch OS 9 based on Android 9 Pie operating system. FunTouch OS is never known for being the best custom OS out their but it gets the work done. One thing we have to admit though, over the years, the user-experience, smoothness of the OS has marginally improved but there’s a long way to go. It still needs a bit more polish and refinement to compete with other custom OS from several other manufacturers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The FunTouch OS offers slew of useful features such as the ability to lock each app using passcode or run two instances of the same app, Motorbike mode, GameCube,etc\n",
      "\n",
      "Fingerprint scanner of the phone is fast and unlocks the phone most of the time. The single speaker of the phone is sufficiently loud but it lacks clarity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivo V15: Camera\n",
      "Camera has always been a strong point for Vivo smartphones and Vivo V15 is no different in that regard. The camera is also one of the biggest USP of this smartphone. Let’s start with the 32-megapixel pop-up selfie camera. The pop-up mechanism of the camera works really well and it never failed to respond. The mechanism works fast and is quick to capture as well. With f/2.0 aperture and autofocus feature, the smartphone captures some good looking photos with an ample amount of details and sharpness. However, just like every other Vivo smartphone, Vivo V15 also make photos look a little unnatural by over-brightening the skin tone and removing most of the face details. There’s an option to turn this feature or customise the settings to get some more details from the camera. The low-light performance of the camera is satisfactory and it does not take much time to focus on the subject. But the images turned out to be on a softer side and lacks details as well. This may be because the camera boosts the ISO level to capture more light and as the ISO tends to boost the noise level, it reduces the overall sharpness and details of the photo taken.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The front camera comes with a few shooting modes such as Portrait mode, HDR and more. Users also get some usual features that include HDR, Live Photos, filters and more.\n",
      "\n",
      "The portrait shots from the camera are also acceptable. It’s not the best but gets the work done. The camera manages to detect the edges of the subject quite well while keeping the background blurred. But there’s still room for improvement as sometimes the camera struggles to get the things right.\n",
      "Despite a few shortcomings, the front camera of Vivo V15 is great and captures some good looking shots as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about the rear camera, the smartphone boasts three rear cameras of an 8MP wide-angle sensor with aperture f/2/2, 5 MP depth sensor with aperture f/2.4 and a 12MP primary sensor with f/1,8 aperture.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rear camera offers tons of shooting mode such as Live Photo, Face beauty, Portrait mode and more. There are a bunch of AI-based shooting modes as well which we have already seen in Vivo smartphones. One of the most interesting modes is AI body shaping that works with both photo and video. This mode allows users to tweak the overall aspect of the body with the help of AI recommendation such as head, shoulder, legs, etc. Though the feature works well, we still feel that it is just a gimmick.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming to the image quality of the camera, we captured several photos in different lighting conditions and situations. The Vivo V15 does a good job of keeping a decent balance between the details and sharpness. In well-lit conditions, the smartphone captures images with good colours and details using the primary camera sensor. However, the issue remains the same the images are a bit oversaturated giving it an artificial look and feel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Having a wide-angle sensor is fun, as it gives users an option to capture much more area which moving an inch. The 8MP wide-angle sensor is also capable of captures some stunning shots in both daylight and low-light conditions. The images, however, are more natural compared to the primary sensor of the phone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivo V15: Battery\n",
      "In the battery department, Vivo has equipped its latest V15 smartphone with a big 4000mAh battery which is a good battery capacity for any smartphone of this price range. The smartphone excels in the battery department courtesy to the Helio P70 processor. The Helio P70 happens to be a power efficient processor that focuses on providing great battery life by maintaining the optimal performance of the device.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a single charge, the smartphone provides about 12 hours of juice on normal usage which is quite good. While on medium to heavy load, the smartphone lasts for around 9 hours. By heavy load, we mean, watching videos, surfing the internet, playing games, etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at the figures, the battery life of the smartphone is reasonably good and during our test, the smartphone manages to last for the entire day with the need for a charger. The smartphone gets fast charging support as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivo V15: Verdict\n",
      "Vivo has equipped its latest smartphone with almost everything to make it a good smartphone. Features like pop-up selfie camera, big battery, almost bezel-less display, impressive design, that make the smartphone stand apart from what other brands are offering.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company has put lots of effort on the camera and we have to admit the smartphone does a great job in the camera department especially the pop-up selfie camera which is fast as well as captures some good looking photos. It’s not as if all is hunky and dory with the smartphone as Vivo V15 has some cons as well. Let’s start with the processor, we understand that Helio P70 from MediaTek is a capable processor and we have seen it bunch of other smartphones as well. The performance is good but for a smartphone priced at Rs 23,900, we wish Vivo could have opted a slightly better processor. At the given price there are smartphones that offers much better overall performance then Vivo V15. Also, it’s 2019 and we are still dealing with the older micro USB charging port which feels outdated and considering most of the smartphone brands made that switch, Vivo should too make that jump with their mid-range devices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the smartphone served the purpose and a normal user won’t face any issue in their day-to-day usages of the phone. Those looking to buy a good camera smartphone at this price, Vivo V15 can definitely one in the list. However, for everything else, there are several other smartphones that offer much better value for money.\n",

      " Updated: Apr 3, 2018, 04:43PM IST\n",
      " It’s astonishing that a word which wasn’t even a part of the lexicon five years back has had such a tremendous impact on an entire industry. It was almost five years ago that Oxford Dictionary officially declared ‘selfie’ as the word of the year. The dictionary editors had then said that, “the word has evolved from a niche social media tag into a mainstream term for a self-portrait photograph.” The selfie phenomena since then has grown multi-fold, so much so that there’s an entire ecosystem around it. Smartphones have been the single biggest contributor in the whole selfie craze. Perhaps it won’t be a gross exaggeration to say that certain brands have thrived and survived just because of selfies. \n",
      "\n",
      "One such brand is Vivo as over the last couple of years it is associated with selfie-centric smartphones. The recent addition to Vivo’s arsenal is the Vivo 9 – its flagship device of the year. A 24MP selfie camera, an iPhone X-line notch, bigger display – on paper Vivo V9 looks like a phone to reckon with. But as they say, there’s many a slip between the cup and the lip. We used the Vivo V9 for a few days and here’s what we think of it:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivo V9 Design: Notch, glass finish polycarbonate back\n",
      "\n",
      "“Is it the new iPhone?” “When did you buy the iPhone X?” were some of the quips we faced as soon as someone saw the Vivo V9 with us. There’s no denying the fact that Vivo V9 is heavily ‘inspired’ by Apple’s latest flagship. And it’s not something that only Vivo is guilty of as the market is soon going to be flooded with a bunch of iPhone X clones. As you get past the whole iPhone X angle, you do realise that Vivo has worked hard on the design. To begin with at just 150 grams, this is a seriously light device for its sheer size. The screen size is 6-inch plus but more on that in the display. \n",
      "\n",
      "The front of the device is completely taken over by the impressive screen which has almost 90 per cent screen-to-body ratio. At the back you find another iPhone X similarity – the vertical dual rear camera set up. The fingerprint scanner and the Vivo branding also find a place at the back of the device. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The back has a glossy finish and the review unit we got as in Champagne Gold colour. The Vivo V9 has an aluminium back and the device is 7.9mm thick. It’s a surprisingly easy to use device considering its size. The other usual set of specifications include the 3.5mm audio jack, speaker grille and microUSB port which are located at the bottom. The left side is home to the hybrid SIM slot whereas the usual suspects like the power button and volume rockers find a space on the right hand side. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivo V9 Display: 6.3-inch full HD+, 19:9 aspect ratio\n",
      "\n",
      "As more and more users turn to their smartphones for watching videos or OTT content, display has clearly emerged as a critical aspect. Before we get into the display experience, let’s get the specs out of the way. The Vivo V9 The smartphone features a 6.3-inch full HD+ (1080x2280 pixels) IPS display with Corning Gorilla Glass 3 on top. There’s also 2.5D curved glass and a 19:9 aspect ratio. And then there’s the notch. The notch is the most prominent part of the display and while it’s borrowed from Apple, there’s a lot of difference. The notch on Vivo V9 is much shorter and has the selfie sensor and speaker. Credit to Vivo for doing a fine job of incorporating it sleekly in the notch. \n",
      "\n",
      "Watch the unboxing video of Vivo V9\n",
      "\n",
      "03:21\n",
      "\n",
      "As for the actual display, Vivo V9 delivers impressive performance. The 19:9 aspect ratio is the star of the show here as it is one of the better screens you will spot. Watching videos is a treat on the Vivo V9 while images appear sharp and clear. It’s not all smooth sailing though with the V9’s display. The moment you step under direct sunlight, the display is slightly dull. Even though the brightness levels are satisfactory, it definitely takes a beating outdoors. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivo V9 Performance: Qualcomm Snapdragon 626, 4GB RAM\n",
      "\n",
      "We were a bit disappointed to find that under the hood the Vivo V9 has the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 626 processor. While it’s not a slight on the processor, for a device that claims to boast of the ‘flagship’ tag, it could have had a better processor. Unlike most of its competition, the Vivo V9 also doesn’t have a 6GB variant and comes with 4GB RAM. To put it bluntly, these aren’t really top-of-the-line specs and perhaps belong in the mid-tier segment. The smartphone packs 64GB of inbuilt storage and supports expandable storage via microSD card up to 256GB. \n",
      "\n",
      "Having said that, the Vivo V9’s performance will pass the tests for most users for all the routine tasks they entrust their smartphones with. The smartphone runs the latest Android Oreo 8.1 which is based on Funtouch OS 4.0. There are a lot of preloaded apps that come with Vivo V9. These include vivo Cloud, vivo.com as well as Flipkart, Newspoint, Amazon Prime among others. The unfortunate thing here is that you can’t delete them – apart from the third-party apps. We didn’t use most of the preloaded apps and found them a bit pointless. The overall UI for most Android users will be easy to get accustomed to. \n",
      "\n",
      "There is a lot of iPhone in the Vivo V9 in terms of the interface. For instance, swiping up from bottom you get options to increase the volume, brightness or turning on Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. It also shows the frequently used apps. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vivo V9 has the picture-in-picture mode and one can go to Settings and which apps support it. There are some nice software enhancements like one-handed mode, app cloning and smart motion gestures. It’s something we have also seen on the Motorola devices. For instance, if you just shake the device, the flashlight can be turned on. \n",
      "\n",
      "While the 19:9 aspect ratio is a great feature to have, some apps – and most games – still opened in 18:9 aspect ratio. Even while playing YouTube videos, you will notice a black strip which is an eyesore. In terms of software, the Vivo V9 could have had offered a better experience. For example, the Vivo 9 runs the TouchPal keyboard which is frankly quite outdated. \n",
      "\n",
      "The two other common features doing the rounds also find a place in the Vivo V9. Both the fingerprint scanner (at the back) and the face unlock feature. The fingerprint scanner is as smooth as it gets and the face unlock also works more or less. If you’re in a low-lit area, the Vivo V9 does take more than two attempts to unlock through face recognition. \n",
      "\n",
      "A feature that really impressed us on the Vivo V9 is the audio performance. The speaker on the Vivo V9 does a really fantastic job and is very loud. It is one of the best speaker we have come across in a smartphone. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Vivo V9 Camera: 24MP front camera, 16MP+5MP rear camera\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s clear that the camera is where Vivo has marketed itself differently from competition. The camera is supposed to be its ‘pièce de rèsistance’. Let’s delve into the selfie camera which is a 24-megapixel sensor with f/2.0 aperture. It has a lot of features like Face Beauty, Face Beauty video call, HDR mode and Gender Detection ( a bit bizarre). \n",
      "\n",
      " What Vivo is also marketing the device is for its AI-enabled camera. Here the AI-powered camera deals more with the Face Beauty – in other words it does have an effect on the images but it’s not something we really appreciated. The use of AI here is more for an effect rather than really going deep and have a more meaningful impact. \n",
      "\n",
      " Over the years, Vivo has worked hard to improve the selfie camera and the results are evident in the V9. The selfies clicked with the Vivo V9 came out sharp and extremely accurate – especially outdoors. One can see the colour accuracy and sharpness vividly. The selfie camera also autofocuses extremely quickly. There’s another iPhone-like feature here as well. The Live photo feature which records what happens 1.5 seconds before and after a picture is clicked. It’s clear that Vivo has left no stone unturned in giving the perfect selfie experience. The Portrait bokeh mode has also been added to the front camera and the results are impressive. The selfie camera lives up to its reputation and is one of the better ones around. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The AR stickers which we saw in Samsung’s Galaxy S9 smartphones also find a place in the Vivo V9. But it functions differently. What you can do with AR stickers is that you can use a lot of stickers on AR selfie. It’s a fun feature to have and the Snapchat brigade will actually like it. \n",
      "\n",
      "If the front camera doesn’t leave much room for complaints, the rear camera is a different story altogether. The Vivo V9 sports 16-megapixel and 5-megapixel sensors at the back placed in a vertical setup. You can also find single LED below the cameras. For starters, the default mode on Vivo V9 is bizarrely called Take Photo. You can also find other modes like Professional, Ultra-HD, Slo-mo, Time Lapse, Bokeh mode, Shot refocus, HDR, Face Beauty, and Panorama. We clicked a lot of images with the Vivo V9 and the problem we had was the consistency. It’s not as if the camera doesn’t click good quality images. It does – especially outdoor shots – but in dim-lit conditions the Vivo V9 leaves a lot to be desired for. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bokeh mode is one of the better we have seen and is clearly the highlight of the rear camera. The Live feature works well and overall in outdoors, the Vivo V9 delivers crisp and sharp images. For instance, we clicked a lot of images in the neighbourhood park and most of the images were reasonably good. The colour rendering was good as was the detailing. But in poorly lit conditions, it didn’t impress us at all. \n",
      "\n",
      "Combine the front and rear camera experience and you get a smartphone which will meet most smartphone users’ expectations. The selfie camera is one of the best around but the rear camera could’ve been better. It keeps in tone with the overall vibe of the smartphone. Some excellent features while some aren’t really up to the mark. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Battery: 3260mAh \n",
      "The 3260mAh battery on the Vivo V9 delivers impressive performance. One can throw a host of tasks at the Vivo V9’s battery and it handles with consummate ease. Those who love to check Instagram or Facebook every five minutes or watch a lot of videos can easily use the smartphone for a day without having to reach for their charger. If you’re a moderate user then the Vivo V9 can easily last you a day and a half.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "VerdictFrankly, the Vivo V9 is a hard smartphone to judge. It lives up the selfie promise, has an impressive display and the 19:9 aspect ratio also is extremely handy. AI is more of a buzzword as the real impact of it can hardly be noticed. Priced at Rs 22,999, it’s not a budget smartphone. What lets it down is the mid-range specs and the software experience. With a flagship device you expect top-notch specifications which the Vivo V9 lacks. Yet, it’s a smartphone that delivers performance which most users will find it more than acceptable. It’s biggest competitor will be the recently launched Oppo F7 as that too is a selfie centric device. In the battle of selfies, Vivo might have a winner on its hands. Overall as a smartphone one can’t help but feel that the V9 could’ve been a much better device.\n",

      " The notch is done. Dual rear camera set up is almost a passé and bezel-less display is so 2017. So how do smartphone manufacturers stand out from the crowd? Well, if you’re Vivo then you launch a smartphone – the Vivo X21 -- that has the in-display fingerprint sensor technology. The Chinese smartphone maker first showcased the smartphone at the annual Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018. Since then there has been quite a bit of anticipation around the device. The company has priced the Vivo X21 at Rs 35,990 but it’s powered by a mid-range processor. The competition in this price segment is getting fierce by the day. We used the Vivo X21 for some time and here is our complete review of the smartphone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Design\n",
      "We can safely say that the Vivo X21 is one of the most beautifully looking phone designed by Vivo so far. The smartphone is very sleek and looks strikingly beautiful. The smartphone looks premium and has a shiny black panel but with a subtle colour. It's not flashy like the other smartphones available in the market right now. The smartphone sports an all-black aluminium frame with a rear panel made of glass and has tapered edges which enables the users to hold the smartphone comfortably.\n",
      "\n",
      "About 7.5mm thick, the Vivo VX21 flaunts a 6.28-inch display with 19:9 aspect ratio underneath which lies the fingerprint sensor. The front houses the iPhone X-like notch which consists of the selfie camera and the speaker grille. On the back panel you will find the dual rear camera with LED flash and the Vivo branding. The power button and volume rockers are on the right side of the handset while the top consists of the 3.5mm audio jack. The bottom of the device houses a mono speaker along with the SIM card tray. In all we were quite impressed with the design aspect of the Vivo X21.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Display\n",
      "Display is one of the main highlight of the Vivo X21 as it comes with a notch and it also hides the fingerprint sensor. The Vivo X21 offers a very vibrant and beautiful display. The full HD+ display comes with minimal bezel on the sides. The screen has an AMOLED panel and it offers sharp colours with deeper blacks. The icons of various apps just pop up with you have set a dark theme on the smartphone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The display is bright enough and offers good visibility under direct sunlight. We found the display to be much better as compared to the other smartphones available in the market. As we have already mentioned the display consists of a screen notch which will always be there. This means that just like the OnePlus 6, Vivo doesn’t give you the option to enable or disable the notch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "So, whether you love it or hate it the notch will always be there. Another important feature of the screen of Vivo X21 is its always-on-display. With always-on-display the users can see notifications, missed calls and messages in the lock screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether you have the always-on-display or not you will always see the fingerprint icon when the screen is turned off highlighting that the sensor is placed here.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The in-display fingerprint sensor\n",
      "Vivo X21 is the first smartphone to come with an in-display fingerprint sensor in Indian smartphone market. The company has partnered with Synaptics for the in-display fingerprint technology. Vivo is the first smartphone maker in the world to use this technology in a smartphone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A sensor with size of a thumbnail is pated on the back of the AMOLED display and the light from the display highlights the minute ridges of a fingerprint and the fingerprint of the user reaches the sensor via the gaps between the display's pixels. The fingerprint sensor worked fine on most occasions and we managed to unlock the smartphone within a split second. Also you don't have to press hard and just have to touch your finger on the display. In case you don't want to unlock the smartphone using the fingerprint then you can always go for the infrared-based facial recognition feature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance\n",
      "The Vivo X21 is powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor paired with 6GB of RAM and 128GB internal storage. Users can further expand the storage up to 256GB by adding a microSD card. This is a quite common chipset used when we talk about the mid-segment smartphones. But that’s the thing is the Vivo X21 a mid-range smartphone? It’s price certainly doesn’t say so. Having said that, the smartphone performed fairly well despite being powered by a mid-range processor. Multi-tasking between various games and editing apps was a cakewalk courtesy the humongous RAM capacity. We also ran some benchmark tests on the smartphone and it scored 132293 on AnTuTu and 1563 and 5620 on Geekbench single core and multi core tests respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming to the software, the Vivo X21 runs Android 8.1 operating system topped with the company's own layer of customisation FunTouch. The smartphone has the same UI as the other Vivo smartphones. The company has copied some aspects of iOS such as the shape and look of icons, absence of app drawer, quick settings at the bottom of the screen and others. We personally didn't like the quick settings menu as it was not easily accessible and many a times we used to swipe three to four times to get hold of the menu.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vivo X21 also comes with a gesture mode which allows to use the smartphone with the help of gestures just like the iPhone X. In the gesture mode, the screen is divided into three parts: Swipe up on the ride side to open the control centre, swipe on the centre to go back to the home screen and swipe up on the left to go back on one screen. If you swipe on the central area then screen allows you to scroll via the active apps. The status bar is a bit messy as the notch covers a lot of area and the remaining is not been utilised very well.\n",
      "The notification bar has a very simplistic UI and one has tap on it to read the complete information which can be a turn off for many.\n",
      "\n",
      "The launcher is also pretty basic and there is no app drawer which means that all your apps will be placed on the multiple home screens. Apart from this it has all the standard features of Android 8.1. With the Vivo X21, the company is also focusing a lot on the Music and audio experience of the smartphone. The device consists of a \"Hi-Fi” DAC on board. It has a mono speaker located at the bottom of the device. The audio was satisfactory and nothing great to write about when we heard it on loudspeaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Camera\n",
      "The Vivo X21 comes with a dual rear camera setup. The smartphone houses a 12MP primary module with f/8.1 aperture and phase detection autofocus. Along with this, there is also a 5MP secondary module with f/2.4 aperture. The front of the smartphone houses a 12MP selfie camera with f/2.0 aperture. The camera app on the smartphone has a very simple user interface. As it is a Vivo phone so it is mandatory that it comes with a beauty mode. You can capture a selfie or a portrait and can then beautify it by smoothening the skin or removing wrinkles. The interesting features of the camera are the Live Photos and the AR stickers.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The camera reproduced some decent and satisfactory images when we took portrait shots. The bokeh effect is not that great and on many occasions the camera blurred both the subject and the background. The image quality of the images captured in daylight turned out to be really good but they turned out be grainy and full of noise as soon as the light gets dim. The phase detection autofocus is also not up to the mark and we often got unstable shots of the subjects.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Capturing a good selfie is a trademark of a Vivo smartphone and the Vivo X21 does that perfectly. We were able to get some really good selfies both indoor and outdoor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Battery\n",
      "The Vivo X21 packs a 3200mAh battery which easily lasts up to a day on a single charge with medium to light usage. In case you rely heavily on your phone are a glued to it then you might need a charging point after 8 to 10 hours. The good part is that the smartphone comes with fast charging support which means that the device can charge up pretty quickly. However, we would have appreciated a larger battery in the smartphone. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict\n",
      "Many a times we see a lot of companies erring big time when sticking a price tag on their devices. It seems like Vivo has fallen in the same trap as the Vivo X21 would have been a good option if the company would have priced it under Rs 30,000. But with a hefty price tag of Rs 35,990, the smartphone is certainly not a great buy. In our opinion if you want to spend this much then you can either go for the OnePlus 6 or the Samsung Galaxy A8 plus smartphones. Both the smartphones offer better processor and have same or more RAM capacity. However, they don’t come with in-display fingerprint sensor. But other than this, both the smartphones are better when compared to the Vivo X21. A better price point and the Vivo X21 could have been a far better smartphone than it actually is.\n",

The audio quality was also fine, however, you feel distortion when you switch to high volume levels.\n",

      "Camera: 12MP rear and 5MP front camera with flash on both sides\n",
      "Coming to the camera, the Xiaomi Redmi 5 comes with a 12MP rear camera with LED flash, f/2.2 aperture and 1.25μm pixel size. On the front, you will find a 5MP selfie shooter with selfie flash and f/2.0 aperture. The UI of the camera is similar to the other Xiaomi smartphones and users have the ability to toggle between the flash, HDR and front camera. Along with this, there are also various shooting modes to select from -- Panorama, HDR, Timer, manual mode which allows users to adjust the ISO and White Balance, Straighten, Beautify and others. The camera app also consists of the preview window and the camera and video buttons. The selfie camera comes equipped with a Beautify mode which comes with facial recognition algorithm which guesses the age of the user at the time of capturing a selfie.\n",

      "Talking about the image quality, the Xiaomi Redmi 5 reproduces good images in bright conditions. However, you can easily notice noise and graininess in the shots captured during night or low light. The images captured in the macro mode or HDR are the best ones. They offer ample amount of detailing and clarity. The images taken with the help of flash were reasonably alright and nothing great to write about. The front camera functioned very well during video calls and the selfies captured were also satisfying. Moreover, you can also improve the selfies with the help of the beautify feature.\n",

The camera allows you to capture slow motion videos but there is no support for time lapse. The front camera can also record HD videos. Overall, we found the camera experience to be good and definitely better when compared to the Redmi 4.\n",

      "The Xiaomi Redmi 5 is backed by a 3000mAh battery which is smaller in capacity when compared to its predecessor Redmi 4 which came with 4100mAh battery. Despite the less battery capacity, the smartphone offered good backup courtesy the power efficient Qualcomm processor. The smartphone manages to deliver a day’s battery backup on a single charge. Considering that it’s a budget smartphone it doesn't come with any fast charging and takes a lot of time to get charged. We witnessed that it took approximately two hours to charge completely.\n",

The smartphone offers better display, design and camera, which makes it a good buy under this price segment. You will not find any other smartphone in this price segment with these features. In our opinion it is an all-round smartphone with all the essential features.

      " Xiaomi’s Redmi 4 and Redmi 4A have been a big shot in the arm for the Chinese brand in India. Both devices have done very well and it came as no surprise when the huge success of the Xiaomi Redmi 4A compelled the company to launch Redmi 5A. The company claimed that it sold about eight million units of the smartphone and in order to oblige its customers the company will be giving a discount of Rs 1,000 on first five million units of Redmi 5A. So, at the price of Rs 4,999, the smartphone becomes quite a good deal. The device offers a metal body design and comes with three card slots which are not found in many smartphones. We played around with the entry-level smartphone for a few days, and here's the rest of our review.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Design and Display\n",
      "There is nothing extraordinary about the looks of Xiaomi Redmi 5A. The smartphone comes with a metallic design unlike its predecessor the Redmi 4A which came with a plastic body. The smartphone looks like any other entry level device. The matte finished metallic rear panel consists of the 13MP rear camera with LED flash and a Xiaomi branding. The bottom of the back panel also has the speaker grille. The smartphone doesn’t come with a fingerprint sensor just like the Redmi 4A, which can be a turn off for many as brands are slowly integrating it in lesser-priced device as well. Other than this, like all Xiaomi smartphones this one also comes with an infrared sensor located on the top along with the 3.5mm audio jack. The other interesting feature of the device is the card slots. The smartphone comes with three card slots, this means that the users can use two SIM card and one microSD card at the same time. All the card slots are placed on the right side of the device. The left side offers the volume rockers and the power buttons. The front of the device is dominated by a 5-inch HD display, 5MP selfie camera and three capacitive keys placed on the bottom. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming to the display, the Xiaomi Redmi 5A sports a 5-inch HD display with 720x1280 pixel resolution. We had no problems with the display and it is pretty good considering that it is an entry level smartphone. During our time with the smartphone, we found the display to be good and it also offered decent colour reproduction. The viewing angles were also fine and we also have no issues with its visibility under direct sunlight. Like other Xiaomi smartphones, this one also offers a reading mode, which reduces the blue light emission of the display. Users can adjust that manually or can also set a timer to activate the mode. \n",
      "All-in-all, we liked the design of Redmi 5A and an upgrade from plastic to metal is also impressive. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance and camera\n",
      "The Xiaomi Redmi 5A is powered by a 1.4GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 425 processor paired with Adreno 308 GPU. The company has launched two variants of the smartphone – 2GB RAM and 16GB internal storage and 3GB RAM and 32GB internal storage. Our review unit was the 2GB RAM and 16GB internal storage. Users can also add more storage to the device by adding a microSD card of up to 128GB.\n",
      "\n",
      "During our testing, we found the performance to be reasonably good for an entry level smartphone. We were able to play basic games with ease and there was no lag there. Multi-tasking was also fine and device also didn’t heat up after continuous usage. It offers everything in terms of performance that you would expect from a budget smartphone.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "We also ran Antutu and GeekBench 4 tests on our device. While the phone scored 30,498 in Antutu Benchmarks, the single-core and multi-core scores on GeekBench 4 were 654 and 1722 respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "The audio experience was also nice but we also had a little problem when we played music on loudspeaker. The speaker is located on the rear panel so when the device is placed on a flat surface the audio gets blocked and the audio experience is hampered. The battery backup was sufficient and it lasted for about 12 hours on a single charge. The call quality and signal reception was satisfactory, however, the call were disconnected when we used it from basements or subways. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the software front, the Xiaomi Redmi 5A runs Android 7.1 Nougat operating system topped with MIUI 9 UI layer of the company. This is the first smartphone of the company to come with MIUI 9 out-of-the box. The new UI layer brings some interesting features to the smartphone such as India specific theme, Indian holidays and festivals card under the calendar app, IRCTC Cards in Messaging App, Easy Ola cab and Paytm integration in App Vault feature and others. The device also comes with the second space found in other Xiaomi phones as well. With the help of second space, users can use two profiles under the same smartphone. Other than this, the device has all the standard Xiaomi apps. \n",
      "\n",
      "The phone also comes pre-loaded with third-party apps such as Amazon Kindle, Facebook, MakeMyTrip and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The Xiaomi Redmi 5A boasts of a 13MP rear camera with LED flash and a 5MP front camera like the Redmi 4A. The camera app is quite basic and easy to use. The center has the shutter button and the photo and video buttons are located on the either sides of the shutter. Users can also use live filters and various shooting modes to capture the perfect shot.\n",

      "Talking about the image quality, the Redmi 5A offers competent images. The images captured during daylight packs good amount of detailing and colour reproduction. However, the images captured indoor turned out to be grainy and saturated. On the other hand, the front camera was acceptable and you can further beautify your selfies with the help of the face beauty mode. The camera is capable of recording videos at both 1080p and 720p videos at 30fps.\n",

      "Verdict\n",
      "The Xiaomi Redmi 5A comes with a price tag of Rs 4,999, which makes it a good offering for those first-timers looking for a smartphone. The Redmi 5A has a lot going for it -- the device is powered by Qualcomm processor, offers 13MP camera and 3,120 mAh battery. The only missing point is the absence of fingerprint sensor. For those looking for alternative can consider buying the Nokia 2. \n",

However, we used the smartphone for a good amount of time and here is what we think about it.\n",

      "Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro: Design\n",
      "Xiaomi has always received a lot of appreciation when it comes to build quality of budget smartphones and the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is not different. The smartphone comes with a metal unibody design like the other Redmi series of smartphones. The smartphone is a bit bulky and has borrowed some of its design aesthetics from the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the rear the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro looks same as the Redmi Note 5 Pro. The back panel houses the protruding dual rear camera placed vertically along with the circular fingerprint sensor. The front is dominated by an iPhone X like notch screen. The screen notch consists of the selfie camera and some sensor. The smartphone has a slightly thick chin and this time the company has shifted the LED light indicator on it. Xiaomi’s inexplicable love affair with thick bezels continues with the Redmi 6 Pro as well. At a time, when competition is clearly catching up it does come as a surprise to see Xiaomi not making much innovations to its design game. The handset also has thicker bezels and one cannot call it a bezel less display smartphone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The right side of the smartphone houses the power button and the volume rocker keys. The SIM card tray sits of the left and it comes with triple card slot, this means that the users can use two SIM cards and one microSD card at the same time. The top consists of the IR blaster and 3.5mm audio jack, while the bottom is home to micro USB charging port and speaker. Just another Xiaomi phone is how we would accurately sum up the design of the Redmi 6 Pro as it does not have anything extraordinary to offer in terms of its design.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro: Display\n",
      "Like most of the other smartphones available in the market, the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro also comes with a display of 18:9 aspect ratio. The smartphone features a 5.8-inch IPS LCD full HD display with 1080x2280 pixels resolution. The display is bright enough and offers really good visibility under direct sunlight.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Xiaomi with its last few smartphones has worked on their display and that effort is visible on the Redmi 6 Pro. We also found the colour reproduction to be quite nice on the display of Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro. In case you don't like the notch part of the screen then you can turn it off as well. The company has included an option in the smartphone using which users can hide the notch as per their need. Like the other Xiaomi smartphones, this one also comes with a Reading mode, which reduced the emission of blue light from the screen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Apart from the colour reproduction, the handset also offers good contrast levels. Users also have the option to tinker with the white balance of the display and adjust it as per their requirements.

      "Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro: Performance\n",
      "The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor which is the same chipset that the company introduced in its Redmi Y2 smartphone. With this processor the handset manages to perform well when we talk about routine tasks. This 14nm chipset performs quite well during the gaming sessions. However, you will notice a bit of stutter at times when you are trying to play graphic intensive games like Shadow Fight. So, you are looking for a smartphone for gaming then Redmi 6 Pro is not for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smartphone offers 4GB of RAM and 64GB internal storage which can be expanded further by adding a microSD card. The audio experience on the smartphone was reasonable but doesn’t demand too much of our attention as and there is nothing much to talk about it. The sound output is better on earphones as compared to loudspeaker. We didn't had any problem with the call quality or signal reception.

      "\n",
      "Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro: Camera\n",
      "The Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro sports an AI-powered dual camera with 12MP primary sensor and 5MP secondary camera. The smartphone has the same camera setup as the Redmi Note 5 Pro (surprise, surprise).\n",
      "\n",
      "The camera comes equipped with AI portrait mode and electronic image stabilization. The device has also got the 5MP AI selfie camera. However, the camera is not really up to the mark.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This is the first time that we are facing this issue with a Xiaomi smartphone as until now we have never witnessed any such thing. The low light shots were mediocre as the camera tries hard to avoid the noise but is not able to do that perfectly. The HDR mode enables you to capture more details in an image but for that you need to keep your hands steady for a longer period of time. The front camera also delivers satisfactory results in well-lit conditions, but again it disappoints you when you try to take a selfie in low light. Overall, the camera is a disappointing aspect of the smartphone. If you’re in the market for a phone with a good camera, then perhaps the Redmi 6 Pro isn’t exactly the device for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro: Battery\n",
      "Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is backed by a 4000mAh battery which you will find in most of the Xiaomi smartphones. The company claims that the smartphone can deliver up to 48 hours of battery backup on a single charge. However, during out testing we found that it lasted for a day on single charge and with routine usage. On the other hand, the smartphone also takes up a lot of time to charge from 0 to 100%.

      "Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro: Design\n",
      "Xiaomi has always received a lot of appreciation when it comes to build quality of budget smartphones and the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is not different. The smartphone comes with a metal unibody design like the other Redmi series of smartphones. The smartphone is a bit bulky and has borrowed some of its design aesthetics from the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro.\n",

The front is dominated by an iPhone X like notch screen. The screen notch consists of the selfie camera and some sensor. The smartphone has a slightly thick chin and this time the company has shifted the LED light indicator on it. Xiaomi’s inexplicable love affair with thick bezels continues with the Redmi 6 Pro as well. At a time, when competition is clearly catching up it does come as a surprise to see Xiaomi not making much innovations to its design game. The handset also has thicker bezels and one cannot call it a bezel less display smartphone.\n",

The company has included an option in the smartphone using which users can hide the notch as per their need. Like the other Xiaomi smartphones, this one also comes with a Reading mode, which reduced the emission of blue light from the screen.\n",

However, you will notice a bit of stutter at times when you are trying to play graphic intensive games like Shadow Fight. So, you are looking for a smartphone for gaming then Redmi 6 Pro is not for you.\n",

      " It is more difficult to stay on top than to get there. The minute you hear or read this, you are tempted to put it in the “global gyaan” folder. After all it is one of those phrases – and perhaps it is – that is thrown around in corporate boardrooms. There’s a lot, however, in the adage which can be applied in almost every sphere of life. And how many times we have seen brands, athletes, actors fall prey to the philosophy. Not that it’s happening to the Indian smartphone market leader as of now but going by its recent phones, dare we say it might end up going that way. We keep on saying that the achievement of Xiaomi becoming the number one brand in the country is remarkable. The company has managed to grab the top spot by launching smartphones catering mainly to the budget segment. With each smartphone the company tried to bring something new and extra for the customer at a given price point. However, is that strategy now coming across a bit stale? Has Xiaomi reached a saturation point and is not really bringing anything ‘new’ to the table. If the latest smartphones in the recently launched Redmi 6 series is anything to by then the answers to the above two questions have to be in the affirmative. The company launched three smartphones Redmi 6A, Redmi 6 and Redmi 6 Pro. Out of the three, the Redmi 6 Pro is the most expensive one which comes with a starting price tag of Rs 10,999. At the time of the launch the company announced that the smartphone is designed for a power user. Going by the specifications we didn’t find anything interesting or ground-breaking in the smartphone. However, we used the smartphone for a good amount of time and here is what we think about it.\n",

      "\n",
      "Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro: Design\n",
      "Xiaomi has always received a lot of appreciation when it comes to build quality of budget smartphones and the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro is not different. The smartphone comes with a metal unibody design like the other Redmi series of smartphones. The smartphone is a bit bulky and has borrowed some of its design aesthetics from the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the rear the Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro looks same as the Redmi Note 5 Pro. The back panel houses the protruding dual rear camera placed vertically along with the circular fingerprint sensor. The front is dominated by an iPhone X like notch screen. The screen notch consists of the selfie camera and some sensor. The smartphone has a slightly thick chin and this time the company has shifted the LED light indicator on it. Xiaomi’s inexplicable love affair with thick bezels continues with the Redmi 6 Pro as well. At a time, when competition is clearly catching up it does come as a surprise to see Xiaomi not making much innovations to its design game. The handset also has thicker bezels and one cannot call it a bezel less display smartphone.\n",
      "\n",
      "The right side of the smartphone houses the power button and the volume rocker keys. The SIM card tray sits of the left and it comes with triple card slot, this means that the users can use two SIM cards and one microSD card at the same time. The top consists of the IR blaster and 3.5mm audio jack, while the bottom is home to micro USB charging port and speaker. Just another Xiaomi phone is how we would accurately sum up the design of the Redmi 6 Pro as it does not have anything extraordinary to offer in terms of its design.\n",

      "Xiaomi Redmi 7: Design\n",
      "Xiaomi has introduced the new ‘Aura Smoke’ design with the Redmi 7. The design comes with Lunar Red and Comet Blue colour variants of the phone. Further, the handset feature a glossy plastic body, which is an upgrade from the Redmi 6. Interestingly, the edges of the device has matte plastic frame unlike the glossy back. This feels strange while holding the phone. The back of the device gets dirty too easily. One has to frequently rub off the dust and other tiny particles that stick to its glossy panel. Its front is no smudge free from fingerprints marks. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Redmi 7 comes with what the company calls ‘dot’ notch at the front. The handset has a vertically-aligned dual camera with LED flash at the back. The fingerprint scanner can also be found placed at the back. Redmi branding can be seen at the bottom of the device. At the smartphone's left edge is the SIM card tray. The phone comes with three different slots - two SIM card and one microSD card slot. Power buttons and volume rocker buttons are placed at the right edge. Charging USB port can be found at the regular bottom edge of the device. Dual speaker vents are also placed at the bottom. Top edge of Redmi 7 houses a 3.5mm headphone jack and a microphone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Redmi 7 is a heavy phone with a glossy finish design at the back. This makes it vulnerable to frequent drops and requires user to be careful. \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The device’s viewing angles are fine and colours are sufficiently sharp and vibrant. One needs to maximize the brightness levels to use Redmi 7 in daylight. The screen automatically adapts and changes brightness levels when back indoors. \n",
      "\n",
      "There are three options to optimize display and contrast- automatic contrast, increased contrast and standard. While the automatic mode alters the contrast for available light, standard keeps the contrast constant. Then there are three colour options as well - default, warm and cool. One may choose depending on his/her usage. There is a separate reading mode which makes the colors warmer allowing the eyes to relax. \n",

We did not see any noticeable time lag while switching between the apps. Some of the pre-installed apps that come with Redmi 7 are Sharechat, Paytm, Mi Remote, Mi Drop and Cleaner. However, there is no app drawer with MIUI which may bother few who tend to categorize similar apps into one.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Redmi 7 has features like second space and dual apps. The former creates a separate profile of the user’s data to store apps and photos securely. Dual apps, on the other hand, allows one to create clone apps.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smartphone is powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 632 octa-core processor coupled with 2GB and 3GB RAM options. The Snapdragon processor is another upgrade in Redmi 7 from its predecessor that came with MediaTek Helio P22. \n",
      "\n",
      "We used the device for light gaming and it functioned really well and smooth. However, it begin to falter in case of heavier games. Not only the device’s speed decreased but also it began to heat up. The heating issue also occurred for prolonged sessions of internet surfing and watching movies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smartphone has both fingerprint reader and face unlock for security. While it took a few seconds to unlock the phone using face, it was comparatively quick to do so using fingerprint scanner. We did not face any major calling issue while using the phone. There was stability of network and clarity of voice during a call. \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "We ran a few benchmark tests on the device. It scored 103318 on the Antutu Benchmark test. It is greater when compared to Realm C1’s 73870 and Realme C2’s 68000 score. Redmi 7’s Geekbench score was 1234 and 4272 in single-core and multi-core tests.\n",

The dual-lens rear camera has a 12-megapixel primary sensor and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. As an entry-level phone, Redmi 7 delivers impressive image quality. This may give an edge to the device over other competitors in the same price category. \n",
      "\n",
      "Not only does the rear camera has portrait mode, the selfie camera too comes with the features. The blur effect in this mode was satisfactory. There were not much noises in the images captured by the device. However, the device does not capture much details. But we can not complain about it, considering its price. \n",

      "\n",

      "The use of AI in beautifying images may disappoint a few. While it tend to retain natural colours and surrounding, but in some cases the beautification is aggressive.

      "Xiaomi Redmi 7 is backed by a 4000mAh battery. It takes more than two hours to fully charge the device. We are really impressed with the device’s battery life and will rate it nine out of the ten. With an average usage that may include activities like 2-3 hours of music, 1-2 hours of social media browsing, 3-4 hours of video sessions, the device can last a day easily with a single charge. However, it can survive more than a day using the Adaptive Battery feature that limit battery for apps that are not used often. \n",

      "Verdict\n",
      "\n",
      "We mentioned in our first impressions of Redmi 7 that the smartphone has all the ingredients required to make a good Android smartphone. During our review, we found that the smartphone fares well in two major aspects - battery and camera capabilities. The handset looks good with its new glossy plastic body with ‘Aura Smoke’ design. \n",

      "Xiaomi has introduced two variants of the smartphone. While the 2GB + 32GB model retails at Rs 7,999, other model with 3GB RAM is priced at Rs 8,999. This means that users will get an additional RAM of 1GB by paying an extra Rs 1,000. At this price point, Redmi 7 will compete with Realme C2 and Asus Zenfone Max M2. In totality, Redmi 7 is a good buy for those looking for an affordable phone with decent looks and comparatively fast processor. \n",

      " In a market as competitive as the Indian smartphone market, every company strives to achieve the number one position. But what happens once they achieve it? Ever since Xiaomi joined Samsung as the top-selling smartphone in Indian smartphone market at the end of Q3 2017, as per IDC, it was only a matter of time the Chinese company took the title for itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "And that’s what has happened. According to the latest figures from IDC, Xiaomi has been crowned the king of the Indian smartphone market beating the chaebol during the fourth quarter of the year 2017, creating a certain pressure on Xiaomi to remain the leader. It’s one thing reaching the top but to sustain it is a totally different ball game. Perhaps that’s why Xiaomi has been a bit quieter than other brands. While others have made a lot of noise about launching new handsets, all this time Xiaomi was sitting tight. We’re in the second month of the year and Xiaomi has finally decided to launch its products in India, which are going on sale tomorrow for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among all the launched products -- the Redmi Note 5, Redmi Note 5 Pro and the Mi TV 4 -- recently, here we are going to talk about the Pro edition of the newly launched \n",
      "Redmi Note 5. The India launch marks the global entry of this device which comes with certain features worth your attention such as a completely new Snapdragon 636 processor, the 20MP front camera and a dual rear camera setup, because of which, the company is calling it ‘India’s camera beast.’ We played with the device for a few days and here is our review:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Redmi 5 Pro Design and Display\n",
      "Given the obsession of the smartphone world with the 18:9 aspect ratio of the display Xiaomi too has incorporated this for the \n",
      "Redmi 5 Pro. But this isn’t the first Xiaomi phone to come with a bezel-less design in India as it had introduced this feature with its flagship device the Mi Mix 2 last year. However, with the Redmi 5 Pro, now it won’t burn a hole in your pocket. Due to the bigger display, the capacitive keys are now on-screen keys.\n",
      "\n",
      "The front is as usual dominated by the display along with the selfie camera, earpiece and the usual array of sensors on the top edge, with a layer of 2.5D Corning Gorilla Glass on the top with rounded display corners. The curves make the phone easy to hold and facilitate smooth operation, despite sporting a 5.99-inch screen size.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Turn the smartphone around and you will first see a vertically placed \n",
      "iPhone X like rear camera setup, where the LED flash is housed in between the two lenses. Frankly, this is not the first time when an Apple design feature has made its way to other smartphones. Remember when the dual rear camera setup of the \n",
      "iPhone 7 Plus was unveiled, how many handset makers got \"inspired\" by the design?\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving on, the back panel also has a centrally placed fingerprint sensor and the Mi branding below it. The handset comes with a micro-USB charging port (we fail to understand why) that is placed at the bottom, along with 3.5mm audio jack and the mono speaker. There's a volume rocker and power button on the right, while the left side has a SIM card tray. The top of smartphone has the IR blaster that lets it control devices such as a TV.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Coming to the display, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro has a 5.99-inch screen with a FHD+ resolution of 2160x1080p. The display comes with features such as Reading mode, which reduces the blue light emissions; Schedule that lets you customize the period of this reading mode; Contrast and colour selection and text size options. The images were quite sharp and we did not see any pixelization. The sunlight legibility is not one of the best suits of the device and we also felt the display looks slightly dimmer, when viewed from a certain angle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, we can say we did not have any complaints with the slim body design and is definitely going to grab some attention, even if it’s just for the rear camera panel.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Performance and camera\n",
      "Let’s talk about the specs of the device as it comes with a noteworthy feature. Debuting along with the Xiaomi Redmi 5 Pro is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor, making it the first smartphone in the world to be powered by it. This new chipset features the newest Kyro technology, claimed to be seen in the 800-series chipset. Apart from this, the Note 5 Pro has 4GB RAM and 64GB internal storage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The device runs Xiaomi's MIUI 9 skin based on Android 7.1.1 Nougat, and should hopefully receive an Oreo-based update as all major launches of this year now are expected to come with the latest operating system. The MIUI 9, like the typical Xiaomi UI, has no app drawer and therefore all apps are placed on multiple home-screens. It comes with an app lock feature and dual apps space customized theme option. The leftmost home screen comes with quick cards that show the frequently used features and information. It is placed in the form of cards, similar to Today's page in iOS, that show shortcuts, calendar, take a note and more. This can obviously be customized as per the user and comes in quite handy once you start depending on it.\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing that we must point out is that even though the handset has a third-party theme support, these apps are not yet optimized for the 18:9 aspect ratio of the display. There is a blank black patch that comes on the lock screen if you select any app and it surely gets on your nerves after a point. When we asked Xiaomi about this, they said, \"Starting this month, all official themes from Mi India will be adapted to 18:9 aspect ratio. Also, third-party theme developers are being pushed to adopt their themes for 18:9 phones.\"\n",

      "One thing that we must point out is that even though the handset has a third-party theme support, these apps are not yet optimized for the 18:9 aspect ratio of the display.

      " The year 2017 has been great for Xiaomi as the Chinese brand managed to displace Samsung for the numero uno slot in the Indian smartphone market. The company owes a part of its success to Xiaomi Redmi Note 4, which it claims was its best-selling smartphone during the year 2017. The company has now launched successor of its most popular smartphone in the country, Redmi Note 5 . Redmi Note 5 is the company's first smartphone in this price segment to come with bezel-less display and a selfie flash. Xiaomi also claims that it has made some aesthetic changes to the handset vis-a-vis its predecessor. However, if one goes by pure-play specs then Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 is not much different from Redmi Note 4. \n",

      "We used the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 for some time to test whether it's a worthy upgrade or not. So, here is our complete review of the smartphone. \n",

      "\n",
      "Redmi Note 5 Design and DisplayAt first glance, you may actually feel that you are holding Redmi Note 4 and not Redmi Note 5. The smartphone shares almost identical looks as its predecessor. The similarity is all the more prominent at the rear side. The front of the smartphone has some difference to offer. The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 is the first budget smartphone of the company to come with a bezel-less display. The device comes with a same chassis with antenna lines running across the device but the a large and bright display is its highlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smartphone comes with minimal bezels on the sides and this time the smartphone also comes with a selfie light flash. The smartphone is also slightly slimmer as compared to the Redmi Note 4. The handset is appears sturdy and boasts of good build quality. In fact, it is quite solid when compared to most smartphones in the market. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Redmi Note 5 comes with a 5.99-inch display with round edges and matte finish metal unibody. The power button and volume rockers are placed on the right, while the SIM card tray sits on the left. The audio jack and infrared sensors are located on the top and the charging port and speaker are at the bottom. The back side of the device houses a 12MP snapper with dual-LED flash and circular fingerprint sensor.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all, Redmi Note 5 offers nothing new on the design front as there is nothing new and revolutionary that the device offers. \n",
      "\n",
      "Display is the major highlight of Xiaomi Redmi Note 5. This is the first time that the company has included a full-screen display in a Note series smartphone. The smartphone packs a 5.99-inch full-HD+ display with 18:9 aspect ratio and 1080x2160 pixel resolution. The 2.5D curved glass display is coated with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass on top which protects it from damage and scratches. \n",
      "\n",
      "The display is sharp and the colours are also vivid with deep contrast. The images and videos also offer accurate colour reproduction but it is a bit reflective when used under direct sunlight. Other than this, the overall performance of the display is good for a sub-10K smartphone. Like all the other \n",
      "Xiaomi mobile, the Redmi Note 5 also comes with a Reading mode, which reduces the blue light emission and prevent the eyes from any kind of strain. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Redmi Note 5 Performance and CameraIt seems that the company devoted all its attention in making the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro as it has almost not little improvement on the hardware aspect of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5. The smartphone packs the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 625 processor as there is in the Redmi Note 4. \n",
      "\n",
      "The handset offers a balanced and efficient performance. It managed to do most tasks quite efficiently, be it gaming, multi-tasking or using heavy apps. We did not witnesse any lag or slowness during any of the tasks. The processor is not that great as the Snapdragon 636, but it is for a budget smartphones. In order to test the performance of the smartphone we also ran two benchmark tests. The device scored 77,682 on AnTuTu and 962 and 4324 on Geekbench.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company has introduced two variants of the device -- 3GB RAM and 32GB storage and 4GB RAM and 64GB storage. The users can add more storage by installing a microSD card. The device packs a 4,000 mAh battery, which is less when compared to Redmi Note 4, which has 4100 mAh battery capacity. The battery easily lasts up to a day on single charge. The company has not incorporated fast charging but despite that the smartphone charges quickly. The audio experience is also decent on both headphones and loudspeakers. The call quality and signal reception was also fine and we faced very few call drops.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Despite being the first launch of the year, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 runs Android 7.0 Nougat operating system topped with the MIUI 9 layer of the company. The device offers all the features of Android Nougat and comes with all the standard apps from Xiaomi. These include pre-loaded apps like Amazon, WPS Office and Hungama. A company spokesperson also told us that they are working on Android Oreo Update for the smartphone and that it will be rolled out to Redmi Note 5 soon. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 offers similar camera specifications as the Redmi Note 4. The smartphone sports a 12MP rear camera with dual tone LED flash and a 5MP front shooter with Selfie Light. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the company has altered a few things in the camera department. The rear camera of the Redmi Note 5 features a 12MP shooter with larger pixel size of 1.25um pixels and f/2.2 aperture. In proper light or daylight, the handset managed to deliver some great shots. Moreover, the images captured in macro mode also turned out be good with apt colour reproduction and detailing.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The camera manages to focus quickly on the subject and it also captures the moving objects with ease. We noticed graininess and noise when we used the camera in low-light. The larger pixel size manages to capture more light but with the absence of electronic stabilisation some shots turned out to be blurry. \n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about the front camera, the device offers a 5MP snapper with selfie flash for capturing low-light selfies. The front camera comes with f/2.0 it captures good selfies in daylight. When we took some selfies in low-light the images turned to be good at sometime and bad at others.\n",

      "VerdictXiaomi Redmi Note 5 is a good smartphone in the price bracket of Rs 9,999. However, the smartphone is surely not the right upgrade for those who have Redmi Note 4. As, apart from larger display and some tweaks in the design there is nothing new that the phone offers when compared to Redmi Note 4. Apart from this, we also feel that the device faces tough competition from the company’s Redmi Note 5 Pro which comes with a starting price tag of Rs 13,999 and offers better specifications and dual rear camera setup. However, for buyers with a budget of Rs 10,000, Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 is a good bet. However, anyone who has even slightly higher budget should go for Redmi Note 5 Pro. \n",

The device packs a 4,000 mAh battery, which is less when compared to Redmi Note 4, which has 4100 mAh battery capacity. The battery easily lasts up to a day on single charge. The company has not incorporated fast charging but despite that the smartphone charges quickly. The audio experience is also decent on both headphones and loudspeakers. The call quality and signal reception was also fine and we faced very few call drops.\n",

      "Despite being the first launch of the year, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 runs Android 7.0 Nougat operating system topped with the MIUI 9 layer of the company. The device offers all the features of Android Nougat and comes with all the standard apps from Xiaomi. These include pre-loaded apps like Amazon, WPS Office and Hungama. A company spokesperson also told us that they are working on Android Oreo Update for the smartphone and that it will be rolled out to Redmi Note 5 soon. \n",

      "The Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 offers similar camera specifications as the Redmi Note 4. The smartphone sports a 12MP rear camera with dual tone LED flash and a 5MP front shooter with Selfie Light. \n",
      "\n",
      "However, the company has altered a few things in the camera department. The rear camera of the Redmi Note 5 features a 12MP shooter with larger pixel size of 1.25um pixels and f/2.2 aperture. In proper light or daylight, the handset managed to deliver some great shots. Moreover, the images captured in macro mode also turned out be good with apt colour reproduction and detailing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The camera manages to focus quickly on the subject and it also captures the moving objects with ease. We noticed graininess and noise when we used the camera in low-light. The larger pixel size manages to capture more light but with the absence of electronic stabilisation some shots turned out to be blurry. \n",
      "\n",
      "Talking about the front camera, the device offers a 5MP snapper with selfie flash for capturing low-light selfies. The front camera comes with f/2.0 it captures good selfies in daylight. When we took some selfies in low-light the images turned to be good at sometime and bad at others.\n",
      "The device is capable of recording HD quality videos which is fine for the smartphone for this price segment. \n",

      "VerdictXiaomi Redmi Note 5 is a good smartphone in the price bracket of Rs 9,999. However, the smartphone is surely not the right upgrade for those who have Redmi Note 4. As, apart from larger display and some tweaks in the design there is nothing new that the phone offers when compared to Redmi Note 4. Apart from this, we also feel that the device faces tough competition from the company’s Redmi Note 5 Pro which comes with a starting price tag of Rs 13,999 and offers better specifications and dual rear camera setup. However, for buyers with a budget of Rs 10,000, Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 is a good bet. However, anyone who has even slightly higher budget should go for Redmi Note 5 Pro. \n",

The smartphone comes with an improved camera and is also the first in the Redmi series to offer four cameras. The smartphone also comes with a notch screen display and is said to be one of the best in this price segment. We used the smartphone for some time to see whether it's worth the hype or not. Here is our complete review of the Redmi Note 6 Pro.\n",

      "Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro: Design\n",
      "At first glance, we thought that we are holding the same Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro in our hand. Yes, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro looks a lot similar to its predecessor. The company has made some tweaks to the design but largely it is the same. The new Redmi Note 6 Pro is 0.21mm thicker as compared to the Redmi Note 5 and is a bit wider as well. The smartphone comes with the same metal unibody design with round edges and curved sides which offer a firm grip to the user. The rear of the device houses the dual rear camera setup with LED, circular fingerprint sensor and the Xiaomi branding. The placement of the rear camera and the fingerprint sensor is same as the one found in Redmi Note 5 Pro. Moreover, the rear camera is also protruding which means that it can attract scratches when kept on any surface. The power button and volume rockers are placed on the right side of the device, while the SIM card tray sits on the left. You can find the charging port and speaker grills at the bottom, whereas the 3.5mm audio jack and IR blaster are placed on the top. The front of the smartphone has a surprise of the Xiaomi users.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company has also incorporated a notch in its smartphone. Yes, the Redmi Note 6 Pro also comes with an iPhone X like notch just like the one found in Redmi 6 Pro. The notch consists of the microphone and the dual selfie camera smartphone. The Redmi Note 6 Pro comes with a quad camera setup. The device comes equipped with two cameras on both rear and front end. Like the other Xiaomi smartphones this one also doesn’t come with any hardware button on the front and users can use the soft touch keys or MIUI gestures to control the smartphone. In all the company has done no innovation in terms of the design of the smartphone.\n",

      "Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro: Display\n",
      "The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro comes with a 6.26-inch full HD+ display with 1080x2280 pixel resolution. The 2.5D curved glass display offers 19:9 aspect ratio and is protected with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass on top. Xiaomi never disappoints you when it comes to the display of the smartphone. Like always the Redmi Note 6 Pro also offers a bright and vibrant display with good visibility under direct sunlight. Users also have the option to hide the notch with a help of a toggle button. The large screen display is ideal for watching movies and TV shows and the viewing angles are also accurate. The display offers deep contrasts and the text and images also come across as sharp with correct amount of colour reproduction. In the display department the smartphone scores full marks as it offers a good experience and is one of the best in this price segment.\n",

      "Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro: Software\n",
      "The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro runs Android 8.1 Oreo operating system topped with company’s own layer of MIUI 10. The company has incorporated a lot of elements in the UI which matches to that of Android 9.0 Pie. For instance, the notification panel is round in shape just like that of the new Google Material Design 2.0 update. You can access Google Search by simply swiping up from anywhere on the display. By swiping left you will find the overview of quick apps and other information which is called the ‘Xiaomi Guide’. From here you can clear the cache, create new notes, add calendar events and do much more from the single screen. Like all the other Xiaomi smartphones, this one also comes with all the Xiaomi apps pre-loaded. There is no app drawer which means all your apps are placed on the home screen itself. The device also offers the dual app mode using which you can use two accounts for the same app. For instance, you can have two WhatsApp, two Facebook accounts in the same smartphone. There is also a one-hand mode, which shrinks the display and makes it easier for the user with small hands to use the device. Apart from this, the smartphone offers all the essential features on Android 8.1 Oreo.\n",

      "Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro: Performance\n",
      "The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro is powered by the same processor as its predecessor. The smartphone packs a 1.8GHz octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor paired with 6GB of RAM and 64GB internal storage. Users can further expand the storage by adding a microSD card. During our testing of the smartphone we found it to be pretty much smooth. The handset offers smooth multitasking. You can switch between apps with ease and there are no lags in that. The gaming experience was also good but only if you are not playing heavy games. We noticed a stutter while playing graphic heavy games and also there were some major heating issues as well. The smartphone became really hot after a continuous gaming session of 45 minutes. We also used some editing apps on the device and that worked fine without any lag. The smartphone also comes with a P2i hydrophobic nano-coating which protects the device from splash and spills.\n",

      "Coming to the audio performance, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro is offers a decent audio performance. We listened to different kind of music and the sound output turned to be quite good on headphones. While on loudspeakers it was not that great.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, there is nothing new about the performance of the smartphone which we haven’t seen earlier. We would have appreciated a more powerful processor. This means that the if you have a Redmi Note 5 Pro and want to upgrade then the Redmi Note 6 Pro is not an ideal option for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro: Camera\n",
      "The Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro comes with a dual camera setup on both rear and front end. The smartphone sports a 12MP AI dual camera with a wider f/1.9 aperture and LED flash. There is also a secondary 5MP depth sensor. The rear wider aperture of the rear camera manages to capture crisp and clear images even in low light. The images captured indoor and in low light were clear and there was very less noise. One thing which liked about the camera is its focusing capabilities. The smartphone camera is capable of focusing very fast on the object. On the other hand, the images taken during daylight were bright and full of accurate detailing. We don’t know that whether it is the problem of the smartphone or the software on some occasions the images turned out be very sharp and at times they were quite dull. We also saw some image degradation and little noise. Along with this, we also noticed a bit of lag in the camera app and during image processing.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The device also features a dual front camera with a 20MP primary sensor with Super Pixel technology which increases the effective pixel size. There is a 2MP secondary sensor which takes care of the depth and helps in capturing good portrait shots. The front camera also works fine and captures decent selfies. However, we would have preferred a toned down beautification feature in the selfies. The portrait shots captured using the front camera were pretty impressive. The overall camera performance was the smartphone was good for a handset in this price segment.\n",

During our testing of the smartphone we noticed that the device doesn’t offer that. It easily lasts a day of heavy usage and moderate usage can stretch the battery backup up to one and a half day but not more than that. Also the company claims that the smartphone comes with Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 support, which means that the device does support quick charging. However, in order to use the feature you have to purchase a fast charger separately from Mi.com.\n",

      " A couple of years ago, cricketing legend Shane Warne had taken to Twitter and said that he went for a walk and was stopped for three selfies. “The autograph is officially dead,” he tweeted. In 2013, Oxford dictionary officially declared selfie as the “word of the year.” Selfie is the ultimate weapon for digital narcissism – the perfect tool for showoff – aided by the meteoric rise of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. It hasn’t been a surprise to see smartphone makers jump on the selfie mania and arm people with devices that can take the “perfect selfie”. Brands like Vivo, Oppo, Gionee’s bread and butter devices are selfie-oriented smartphones. What’s surprising is that a brand like Xiaomi had waited so long to launch one such phone. However, with the Redmi Y1, the Chinese brand has finally got a selfie phone in its portfolio. We spent a few days with it to know what’s good and what’s not so good about the phone. Read the rest of our review to find out…\n",

      "\n",
      "Xiaomi Redmi Y1 Design\n",
      "It doesn’t come as a surprise to see the Redmi Y1 look like a few other smartphones from Xiaomi’s Redmi family. It’s not a slight on the design of the phone or Xiaomi as such because the minimalistic look and feel of the Redmi Y1 is attractive. It’s credit to Xiaomi, in fact, that despite having a plastic body, the Redmi Y1 manages to look premium and sleek. Flip over the phone and you’ll notice that it deceptively looks like it has a metal body when the side edges, power and volume rocker buttons are indeed made out of plastic. It’s perhaps the use of plastic that makes the Redmi Y1 extremely light to hold. With it being a lightweight device, Redmi Y1 is easy to grip and singlehanded operations are a breeze. Xiaomi Redmi Y1 comes in Gold and Dark Grey colour variants and the review unit we got was dressed in Gold.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The front panel of the smartphone is dominated by the 5.5-inch HD (720x1280 pixels) display. On top of that, there is a 16MP camera along with a diffused selfie flash. Right below the screen, there are non-backlit capacitive touch buttons that can be used for navigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smartphone’s fingerprint sensor lies at the back panel, which also has that 13MP primary camera and LED flash at top right and Xiaomi branding at the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The power and volume rocker buttons are sandwiched at the right edge while the SIM tray is on the left. The 3.5mm jack lies on the top and the microUSB port and speaker grilles are at the bottom. The non-removable back panel of the smartphone houses a 3080mAh battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The build quality of the smartphone aided by its ease of use and premium looks did impress us. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The display of Redmi Y1 reproduces accurate colours and images projected are sharp and clear. There wasn’t any pixelation and viewing angles are satisfactory. Also, if you don’t like the Standard display settings, you can change them to Warm or Cool according to your preference. There is also a Reading mode, which reduces the display’s blue light emission -- a feature that comes in handy for those using their smartphones in dimly lit conditions. There’s an option to schedule a time for turning on the Reading mode automatically. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Xiaomi Redmi Y1 Performance Xiaomi Redmi Y1 comes in two storage variants -- 3GB RAM/32GB internal storage and 4GB RAM/64GB inbuilt storage. Redmi Y1 runs MIUI based on Android 7.1 Nougat and is powered by the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor. Selfie lovers get a 16MP front-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture, 76.4-degree wide angle sensor and a dedicated flash along with the Beautify feature. There is a 13MP rear camera with PDAF and f/2.2 aperture. The smartphone has a 3080mAh battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smartphone we got for review had 3GB RAM and came with Android 7.1 Nougat skinned with MIUI 9 Beta. If you have been using a device which runs stock Android, it’ll be quite a change for you. The MIUI skin brings a different look to the phone’s software. \n",

      "The Settings section of the phone is different and so are the app permissions.

An example of adding one such customization is Dual Apps feature – which only functions of select apps. For instance, you choose Dual Apps feature for Amazon.

      " A couple of years ago, cricketing legend Shane Warne had taken to Twitter and said that he went for a walk and was stopped for three selfies. “The autograph is officially dead,” he tweeted. In 2013, Oxford dictionary officially declared selfie as the “word of the year.” Selfie is the ultimate weapon for digital narcissism – the perfect tool for showoff – aided by the meteoric rise of social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. It hasn’t been a surprise to see smartphone makers jump on the selfie mania and arm people with devices that can take the “perfect selfie”. Brands like Vivo, Oppo, Gionee’s bread and butter devices are selfie-oriented smartphones. What’s surprising is that a brand like Xiaomi had waited so long to launch one such phone. However, with the Redmi Y1, the Chinese brand has finally got a selfie phone in its portfolio. We spent a few days with it to know what’s good and what’s not so good about the phone. Read the rest of our review to find out…\n",

      "Xiaomi Redmi Y1 Design\n",
      "It doesn’t come as a surprise to see the Redmi Y1 look like a few other smartphones from Xiaomi’s Redmi family. It’s not a slight on the design of the phone or Xiaomi as such because the minimalistic look and feel of the Redmi Y1 is attractive. It’s credit to Xiaomi, in fact, that despite having a plastic body, the Redmi Y1 manages to look premium and sleek. Flip over the phone and you’ll notice that it deceptively looks like it has a metal body when the side edges, power and volume rocker buttons are indeed made out of plastic. It’s perhaps the use of plastic that makes the Redmi Y1 extremely light to hold. With it being a lightweight device, Redmi Y1 is easy to grip and singlehanded operations are a breeze. Xiaomi Redmi Y1 comes in Gold and Dark Grey colour variants and the review unit we got was dressed in Gold.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The front panel of the smartphone is dominated by the 5.5-inch HD (720x1280 pixels) display. On top of that, there is a 16MP camera along with a diffused selfie flash. Right below the screen, there are non-backlit capacitive touch buttons that can be used for navigation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smartphone’s fingerprint sensor lies at the back panel, which also has that 13MP primary camera and LED flash at top right and Xiaomi branding at the bottom.\n",
      "\n",
      "The power and volume rocker buttons are sandwiched at the right edge while the SIM tray is on the left. The 3.5mm jack lies on the top and the microUSB port and speaker grilles are at the bottom. The non-removable back panel of the smartphone houses a 3080mAh battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The build quality of the smartphone aided by its ease of use and premium looks did impress us. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The display of Redmi Y1 reproduces accurate colours and images projected are sharp and clear. There wasn’t any pixelation and viewing angles are satisfactory. Also, if you don’t like the Standard display settings, you can change them to Warm or Cool according to your preference. There is also a Reading mode, which reduces the display’s blue light emission -- a feature that comes in handy for those using their smartphones in dimly lit conditions. There’s an option to schedule a time for turning on the Reading mode automatically. \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Xiaomi Redmi Y1 Performance Xiaomi Redmi Y1 comes in two storage variants -- 3GB RAM/32GB internal storage and 4GB RAM/64GB inbuilt storage. Redmi Y1 runs MIUI based on Android 7.1 Nougat and is powered by the octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 435 processor. Selfie lovers get a 16MP front-facing camera with f/2.0 aperture, 76.4-degree wide angle sensor and a dedicated flash along with the Beautify feature. There is a 13MP rear camera with PDAF and f/2.2 aperture. The smartphone has a 3080mAh battery.\n",
      "\n",
      "The smartphone we got for review had 3GB RAM and came with Android 7.1 Nougat skinned with MIUI 9 Beta. If you have been using a device which runs stock Android, it’ll be quite a change for you. The MIUI skin brings a different look to the phone’s software. \n",
