0,[],28 February 2019,2000221," Samsung's entry into the online-exclusive domain of the Indian smartphone market began with the Galaxy M10 and the Galaxy M20, both of which have received a positive response as per Samsung's own statements. Carrying forward this momentum, the South Korean electronics giant has today launched the Galaxy M30, a new addition to the Galaxy M-series portfolio, which offers triple rear cameras, fast charging, and a large battery at a competitive price point of Rs. 14,990. We managed to get a brief hands-on experience with Samsung's latest smartphone, and here are our first impressions. The Samsung Galaxy M30 flaunts a gradient design on its rear panel and comes in two colour options – Gradation Black and Gradation Blue. Unlike the gradient textures that we have come across on smartphones such as the Honor 10 and the Huawei Nova 3, the Samsung Galaxy M30's finish does not change colours when light falls on it from different angles. The rear panel has an understated elegance to it, but it attracts smudges easily.    The vertically aligned triple rear camera setup sits almost flush with the rear panel, while the fingerprint sensor is placed beside it. The right edge hosts the power and volume buttons, which provide nice clicky feedback. The left edge of the Samsung Galaxy M30 houses the SIM tray (Nano + Nano) with a dedicated microSD card slot, while the bottom edge features the speaker, USB Type-C port, and 3.5mm headphone jack. The Galaxy M30's build quality feels solid, and for a smartphone packing a 5,000mAh battery, it is surprisingly light and easy to handle. As for the hardware under the hood, the Samsung Galaxy M30 is powered by the same octa-core Exynos 7904 processor as the Galaxy M20, and comes in two configurations — 4GB of RAM with 64GB of storage, and 6GB of RAM with 128GB of storage. You have the option to expand storage using a microSD card (up to 512GB). In the imaging department, the Galaxy M30 packs a triple rear camera set-up with a 13-megapixel primary sensor, a 5-megapixel depth sensor, and a 5-megapixel wide angle camera. On the front, a 16- megapixel camera handles selfies. The Samsung M30 packs a 5,000mAh battery with support for fast charging   The front of the Samsung Galaxy M30 is dominated by the 6.4-inch Super AMOLED full-HD+ display flaunting the Infinity-U design with a small notch at the top and a thick chin at the bottom. The display is vibrant and is quite bright, with wide viewing angles, something that is typical of a Super AMOLED panel. The Samsung Galaxy M30 features Widewine L1 certification, which means that users can stream HD content from services like Netflix. On the software side, the Galaxy M30 will ship with Samsung Experience v9.5 based on Android 8.1 Oreo, but Samsung has promised to release an Android Pie update soon. The Samsung Galaxy M30 packs a large 5,000mAh battery that also supports fast charging, courtesy of the bundled 15W charger. In our brief hands-on experience, we found the new smartphone to be snappy, and it could be quite an attractive offering in its price bracket. We'll reserve our verdict for the in-depth review, coming up soon, in which we'll thoroughly assess the Galaxy M30's performance, battery life, camera quality, and other important parameters. Are the affordable Realme 3 and Samsung Galaxy M30 smartphones worth buying?

1,[8],08 February 2019,1989806," In 2019, we'll see a new wave of flagship smartphones with even thinner display bezels, better cameras and some, without any ports or buttons. Among all this futuristic tech, we can also expect last year's flagship features and technology to trickle down to more mainstream phones. One of the first instances of this new trend can be seen in the Oppo K1. This is the debut offering in a brand-new series from Oppo, which offers an in-display fingerprint sensor at a very affordable price. In fact, the Oppo K1 is currently the least expensive smartphone in the Indian market with an in-display fingerprint sensor, giving it bragging rights in a market where it's rather difficult to stand out from the competition. But is that all Oppo has concentrated on, or is the K1 a good all-rounder too? Let's find out in our Oppo K1 review.    The Oppo K1 launched around October in China, so it's not exactly brand new, and that shows in the aesthetics and design. There's a strong resemblance to many existing Oppo smartphones such as the Oppo A7 (Review) and the Oppo F9 Pro (Review). The plastic body is well put-together and the phone has a good heft to it, which we liked. The back of the Oppo K1 has a gradient design, which was very striking in the Astral Blue colour scheme of the unit we have for review. It's also available in a Piano Black trim. The 3D injection-moulded back creates some cool effects when held against light, and it also didn't pick up any visible scuffs during our review period. However, it does pick up fingerprints quite easily. The placement of buttons is good and so is their build quality. The tray on the left can accommodate two Nano-SIM cards and a microSD card (up to 256GB). Dual 4G VoLTE is also supported. At the bottom we have a speaker grille, a Micro-USB port, and a 3.5mm headphone socket. The Oppo K1 has a gradient back panel, which looks very striking in this Astral Blue trim   The Oppo K1 features a 6.41-inch, full-HD+ display with Corning Gorilla Glass 5 for protection, which is always welcome. Since this phone has its fingerprint sensor under the display, Oppo has had to use an AMOLED panel, making it one of the few phones in this segment with this kind of screen. Punchy colours and deep blacks come with the territory of such a display but you can tweak the colour temperature from the Settings app if required. The Oppo K1 has a water-drop notch at the top, so there's plenty of screen real-estate available for use. The bezel around the display is visible but it's not very thick and neither is the chin at the bottom. Due to the limited space around the selfie camera, there's no notification LED. As always, there's a screen guard pre-applied on the phone. Around the back, we have the dual-camera module, placed in a similar fashion to what we've see on other Oppo phones such as the F9 Pro. In the box, you'll find a silicone case, SIM eject tool, Micro-USB cable, a 10W power adapter, and headset. The Oppo K1 is currently the most affordable phone with an in-display fingerprint sensor   In its quest to make this the most affordable phone with an in-display fingerprint sensor, it's nice to see that Oppo hasn't compromised on the main specifications too much. This phone is powered by the reliable Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 octa-core SoC, which we've seen in phones such as the Realme 2 Pro (Review) and Xiaomi Mi A2 (Review). In India, the Oppo K1 launched in just one variant which has 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. You also get dual-band Wi-Fi 802.11ac, Bluetooth 5, USB OTG, GPS, and sensors such as a compass, accelerometer, ambient light sensor, and gyroscope. There's no FM radio. The Oppo K1 is still rocking ColorOS 5.2 based on Android 8.1 Oreo. We guess we'll have wait a bit longer for the ColorOS 6 debut with some new Oppo smartphones, possibly at MWC 2019. We've explored all the features of this version of ColorOS in our reviews of the Realme U1 (Review) and Realme 2 Pro, so we'll just run through some of the notable ones here. Game Space has an upgraded look, and Oppo's Hyper Boost game optimisation feature supports PUBG Mobile in addition to other games such as Arena of Valor, Cross Fire, etc. It's said to deliver a “boost” in loading times and game performance. We tried it out with PUBG but it's really hard to tell if there's a tangible benefit to be had, as network performance is always a big variable. You also get additional features such as Smart Sidebar, which is a pop-out tray for app shortcuts; Smart Scan, which lets you do some multi-lingual translations; and ORoaming, which creates a virtual SIM card with affordable data packs when you're overseas. Other than the system apps, there aren't a lot of pre-installed third-party apps other than Facebook. The default browser and Oppo's app store continue to clutter your notifications shade with alerts and ads. You can disable the app store's spam but the browser continues to spam you even after disabling this feature. This is the same issue we faced with the Oppo A7 too. The Oppo K1 uses ColorOS 5.2 which is still based on Android 8.1 Oreo   We used the Oppo K1 as our primary device for a couple of days and we didn't have any major complaints when it comes to general usage. The phone does feel a bit large when you hold it so one-handed operation isn't very easy. Despite the glossy texture on the back and sides, it's surprisingly not too slippery. The AMOLED display produces bright, saturated colours and sunlight legibility is also very good. The display has good touch response too, which was evident when typing. ColorOS also runs smoothy with no hiccups thanks to the 4GB of RAM. The in-display fingerprint sensor works just the same as what we've used on other phones with this feature, and by that we mean it's not as fast as a standard capacitive sensor. You'll need to keep your finger properly aligned with the fingerprint icon for a full second before the Oppo K1 successfully authenticates you. You can choose between three different fingerprint animations for the lock screen. We found face recognition to be a lot quicker and more convenient most of the time. Just like with previous Realme and Oppo devices, it's very quick, and works in low light by bumping up the screen brightness to illuminate your face. The Oppo K1 has a single speaker, a Micro-USB port and a 3.5mm headphone socket at the bottom   The large 6.41-inch display is great for watching videos on. Colours really pop and the black levels are satisfyingly deep. The speaker is fairly loud when watching YouTube videos but for some apps, like PUBG Mobile, it sounds a bit weak even at full volume. The audio quality is average at best, sounding a bit tinny and one-sided, since there's only one speaker at the bottom. The Oppo K1 had no trouble handling heavy games either. Asphalt 9: Legends was perfectly smooth with the graphics cranked up to the ‘High' preset, while PUBG Mobile delivered a consistently playable framerate at the ‘Medium' graphics setting. We were happy to note that the phone doesn't get too hot when gaming even for more than 30 minutes at a stretch. You also have the option to mask the notch for individual apps if you find it interfering with your content. Benchmark numbers also indicate that the phone should be able to handle games and general apps pretty well. In AnTuTu, we got a score of 1,28,852 points, while the T-Rex graphics test in the GFXbench benchmark suite returned 41fps. Coming to the cameras, Oppo has used a standard 16-megapixel camera and a depth sensor on the rear, and a bigger, 25-megapixel sensor with an f/2 aperture on the front, much like it usually uses in its selfie-centric F series. We start with the selfie camera, which has an artificial intelligence (AI) beautification system. You can manually choose the level of beautification too. Enabling this seemed to smoothen the texture of our skin a bit too much, to a point where it became obvious that some sort of filter was being used. If you're into this kind of selfies, then you'll like the AI beautification, and if not you can simply turn it off. Image quality without beautification is good in daylight, as textures like skin look a lot more natural. You can have a background blur for selfies, but we found that edge detection wasn't very accurate. Selfies look more natural without the beautification filter   AI beauty mode is generally aggressive with skin smoothening (Tap for full-sized images of Oppo K1 cameras samples)   Selfies taken in low light also hold up well but the Bokeh mode's edge detection issues are more exaggerated here. You get ‘Auto HDR' for the front camera, which helps correct the exposure a bit when shooting against bright light. The rear 16-megapixel sensor has an f/1.7 aperture, which technically means it should be able to capture good photos in dark environments as it allows more light into the sensor. The Oppo K1 does manage this but only to an extent. In our tests, we saw that noise was handled well in shadows and darker regions in general, but textures weren't very detailed and distant objects in landscapes lacked good definition. Macros in low-light fared a bit better. Under good light, the main camera captured good details in close-ups. Edges were well defined and colours weren't exaggerated. Landscapes also packed in a fair bit of detail, and HDR seemed to do a decent job of balancing the exposure. There's a 2x zoom button in the viewfinder but it's just digital and not optical. Shutter lag isn't an issue but we noticed that you can't use the shutter button several times in rapid succession to take multiple pictures as there's a wait of about a second or two before the camera processes your photo and is ready to go again. It's a little annoying as we're used to being able to quickly take multiple photos with most smartphones. Tap to see full-sized Oppo K1 camera samples    The second 2-megapixel sensor is only used for edge detection when shooting in Portrait mode. It does a decent job with objects and people, with a few minor misses at times. However, the camera takes a while to focus in this mode, even when shooting in good light. The camera app also gives you the standard shooting modes such as Panorama, AR stickers, and an Expert mode, which lets you manually adjust the ISO, focus, and shutter speed. For video, the Oppo K1 can shoot at up to 4K resolution. Continuous autofocus worked very well in our tests. At 4K, the white balance was generally a bit off. Daylight footage looked too warm and colours were oversaturated. There's also no stabilisation at this resolution, which is a little disappointing. At 1080p though, image quality is better with more accurate white balance, and footage is stabilised. The Oppo K1 features a 3,600mAh battery, which lasted for a decent 12 hours and 36 minutes in our HD video loop test. This translated to well over a day's worth of actual usage for us, which typically included music streaming, a few calls, Internet browsing, and some gaming. The phone doesn't support Oppo's VOOC fast charging but you do get a 10W power adapter, which takes about two and half hours to fully charge the smartphone. VerdictKeeping in mind that the Oppo K1 is the only phone with an in-display fingerprint sensor in its price band, the launch price of Rs. 16,990 is not too bad. We hope it will drop eventually and fall in line with other Snapdragon 660 powered smartphones with comparable RAM and storage configurations, such as the Realme 2 Pro (Review) or the Vivo V9 Pro (Review).  We would have liked some things about the Oppo K1 to have been better. It could have had USB Type-C port and perhaps fast charging as well as better build quality. Low-light camera performance could have been better, and we really wish Oppo would fix that annoying spam from some of its apps in ColorOS. On the bright side, you get solid app and gaming performance, a punchy and sharp display, decent selfie camera, good battery life, and of course, the novelty of an in-display fingerprint sensor — all of which make the Oppo K1 a good package that's worth considering.",Oppo K1 Review,https://gadgets.ndtv.com/mobiles/reviews/oppo-k1-review-1989806,Roydon Cerejo
2,[8],31 January 2019,1985679," Samsung has seen its number one market share position in India swallowed by Xiaomi, in exactly the same way that it overtook Nokia many years ago. The company has tried to respond in several different ways over the years, but very few of its recent low-cost offerings have been competitive enough in our reviews and ratings. The Korean giant has used its youth-focused J-series and software features such as S Bike Mode to address the budget market, but that just can't compare to the big screens, powerful processors, and tonnes of storage that Xiaomi and others offer at the same prices. It's finally time for a complete strategy reset, and so now we have the brand new Samsung Galaxy M-series. The two newly announced models, the Samsung Galaxy M10 (Review) and Samsung Galaxy M20, are launching in India before anywhere else, which shows how important it is for the company to recapture this market. Strategy aside, the new Galaxy M series represents a huge shift for the company in terms of design and specifications. There's no doubt that these phones are aimed squarely at Xiaomi, Honor, Realme, and Asus. It seems almost as though Samsung went out into the market with a checklist and tried to figure out every last little thing that these companies do in their perpetual race to one-up each other. Today, we have the more capable and higher priced of the two models, the Galaxy M20, for review. Let's find out whether Samsung's gamble has paid off, and whether it has finally managed to get the price, features, and performance right. Samsung Galaxy M10 Review    Put simply, this phone does not look or feel like any existing Samsung phone. It's extremely generic and could pass off for something from any of a handful of other manufacturers. Head-on, it's virtually indistinguishable from the Realme U1 (Review) or Oppo F9 (Review), for example. More than a criticism of Samsung though, this says more about how little scope there is for individuality when reducing a phone's features to such a degree of minimalism. The biggest departure from previous Samsung designs is the waterdrop-style 'Infinity-V' notch at the top of the screen, which is just big enough for the front camera to fit into. The screen measures 6.3 inches diagonally with a 19.5:9 aspect ratio and rounded corners in keeping with current trends. There is a bit of a chin at the bottom of the screen — interestingly, if you place the Galaxy M20 and Galaxy M10 side by side, you'll see that they look identical except that the Galaxy M20 has a taller screen and narrower chin, for a screen-to-body ratio exceeding 90 precent. The top and side borders around the screen do look narrow, but the sides of this phone bulge outwards considerably. This helps allow the earpiece to be placed within the frame, above the screen notch. There is an ambient light sensor, but it can't be seen. The proximity sensor is to the left of the notch and that placement doesn't seem to have hurt its functionality. Both the Galaxy M20 and the Galaxy M10 will be sold in the same two colours, Ocean Blue and Charcoal Black. Our Galaxy M20 review unit is Ocean Blue, which does stand out. It's quite dark, with a glossy finish and a very fine grainy pattern that gives it some depth. Samsung hasn't said exactly what material it has used for the rear shell, but it feels plasticky.    The rear and sides of this phone are a single moulded shell with no seams or even antenna lines. We're happy to note that despite being glossy, the rear of this phone isn't slippery at all. The sides of this phone are rounded, but it is bulky overall, thanks to the 5000mAh battery — more on that in a bit. It's also quite thick and heavy, and we felt the weight after using it for extended periods. The Galaxy M10 is a lot lighter in comparison but it obviously doesn't have the huge battery. The Galaxy M20 has a USB Type-C port on the bottom, unlike the Micro-USB port on its less expensive sibling. The speaker grille is also on the bottom, whereas the Galaxy M10 has it on the lower rear. Another big difference between the two phones is that the Galaxy M20 has a fingerprint sensor on the rear — the less expensive model doesn't have one at all. We found the sensor a bit too high for our index fingers to reach comfortably when holding the phone. Everything else is fairly standard — there's a 3.5mm audio socket on the bottom, power and volume buttons on the right, and a tray on the left for two Nano-SIMs as well as a dedicated microSD card slot. The dual rear camera module has a tiny ridge around it to help prevent the lenses from getting scratched, but doesn't protrude at all. Overall, while the Samsung Galaxy M20 doesn't have much of an individual identity, it's more than good enough to take on its competition in the sub-Rs. 15,000 market. Every design choice has been made to support a feature that Samsung needs to offer.    The most interesting thing on the Galaxy M20's spec sheet is its brand new Exynos 7904 processor. This oddly named unit was launched less than two weeks ago, and was designed specifically for the value smartphone segment in India. It has two high-performance ARM Cortex-A73 cores running at 1.8GHz and six power-efficient ARM Cortex-A53 cores running at 1.6GHz, plus a Mali-G71 GPU. Samsung tends to use the same processors across a lot of models, sometimes over the course of several years. Since this is our first experience with the Exynos 7904, our benchmarks will tell us how it competes against the Qualcomm and MediaTek models that other manufacturers in this segment use. The Galaxy M20 is available with either 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage for Rs. 10,990, or 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage for Rs. 12,990. We have latter configuration for review, and a quick look at the market shows that many other models at this price level don't have as much RAM or storage, which could give Samsung an advantage. The rest of the specs are more commonly found in this price bracket. The screen resolution is 1080x2340, with a density of 409ppi. There's a 5000mAh battery, and Samsung says that the bundled 15W charger will fill it up quickly. Ten minutes of charging is supposed to be enough to enjoy three hours of videos or 11 hours of music playback. The primary rear camera is a 13-megapixel unit with an f/1.9 aperture, while the secondary camera has a 5-megapixel sensor and 120 degree field of view. The front camera has an 8-megapixel resolution. Dual VoLTE is supported, and you can use LTE on either SIM at any time.    Samsung seems to have cut a few corners when it comes to the accessories in the box. Other than the 15W charger and USB Type-C cable, there's only a SIM eject pin — there's no protective case or screen guard, and in a page out of the Xiaomi playbook, no headset. It's a little disappointing to see Android 8.1, but at least it was up to date with the January 2019 security patch at the time of our review. The Galaxy M20 runs the Samsung Experience UI, as the company's new One UI is still in its beta test phase. If you've used any recent Samsung phone, you won't find much that's new or different here. Unfortunately, another thing that hasn't changed is Samsung's eagerness to put ads everywhere. From the moment we first booted this phone, we were confronted by them. The entire lock screen is now an ad – Samsung has integrated an app called Glance that shows a different photo or promotional item each time you wake this phone from sleep. Not only are the captions distracting, but they displace useful notifications. In just the first few hours of using this phone we saw repeated clickbait messages to drive traffic to websites or apps. Sometimes we were prompted to vote in polls about cricketers or consumer product brands. Some of them were just flat out ads. We eventually managed to disable this by choosing ‘Wallpaper' rather than ‘Wallpaper & Stories' when setting a new lock screen background image, but we shouldn't have had to dig as much as we did to figure out this workaround. If we had bought this phone, we'd be extremely aggravated by this level of intrusiveness, and we really think Samsung needs to dial back its monetisation efforts. Besides that, we also got the usual barrage of notification spam from the My Galaxy app and some of the other preloaded apps. No matter how many useful extra features a manufacturer's custom UI has, this is the kind of thing that makes us long for stock Android. (L-R) Spammy notifications from the My Galaxy app; advertisement on the lock screen; customisation options for the Glance app.   We didn't have any trouble using the Samsung Galaxy M20 for day-to-day tasks. Apps and light games ran without any trouble, and we multitasked quite heavily too. There was only the slightest hint of lag in the UI on rare occasions, but not enough for us to worry about. Face recognition took about a second to work sometimes, which was annoying, but the fingerprint sensor was very quick. The screen is bright and crisp, with good viewing angles. Videos looked good and games including Asphalt 9:Legends and PUBG Mobile ran fine at medium settings. We did feel the upper rear of this phone get a bit warm while gaming, which is not ideal. Samsung's UI has also adapted well enough to the notch. Single-handed use was a bit difficult, owing to how large the phone is, and adjusting our grip was sometimes awkward because of its weight. We were curious to see how the new Exynos 7904 SoC does in benchmarks, and it delivered good enough performance for this segment. Our AnTuTu score was 107,540 which is in the neighbourhood of what Qualcomm's Snapdragon 632 or Snapdragon 636 can achieve. Geekbench gave us 1,315 for single-core performance and 4,094 for multi-core performance. Graphics scores were disappointing, with GFXbench's T-rex scene running at only 22fps and the Manhattan 3.1 scene at just 7.1fps. Battery life in everyday use was extraordinarily good. We started our day unplugging the phone at around 8am, and used it as usual, with a bit of photography and a few short gaming sessions, and still had about 60 percent left in the evening. We were able to stretch till the middle of the next day without having to charge. However, our HD video loop test ran for only 12 hours, 53 minutes which was relatively disappointing, and other phones in this price class do better with smaller batteries.    The camera app is easy to use and well laid out. Most options and modes are within easy reach, and it's always nice to be able to begin recording video with a single tap. We found that the camera was quick to lock focus and there didn't seem to be much shutter lag. There's a selector for the two cameras right above the shutter button, but it's easy to forget which camera is selected. The app remembers what you were using last, so it doesn't default back to the primary camera each time it's opened. You can enable a movable floating shutter button from the Settings, which could be useful. There are several stickers to choose from, including some that scale to faces automatically, and you can buy more through the Galaxy Apps store. The Pro mode is lacking in options – you can control only the metering, exposure compensation, ISO, and white balance. Samsung Mall integration lets you take photos of objects to search for similar ones across multiple online stores, and in our experience the results were pretty good but not very specific. One noteworthy quirk is that the Live Focus mode only works on faces. You can't use it to get a depth effect on shots of ordinary objects, like you can on virtually every other phone. There's a beautification mode but no AI enhancement, which is something that other brands, especially Honor, are using to differentiate themselves. Photo quality was fairly disappointing. We didn't see the kind of detail and sharpness that we're used to from phones in the sub-Rs. 15,000 price segment. Shots taken in the daytime were looked good on the phone's own screen, but a closer inspection showed that textures weren't very realistic and finer details were lost. On the positive side, all shots were all in focus and colours were fairly vibrant. Quality was also noticeably poorer when using the secondary camera with the wide lens, and there was a significant fish-eye distortion. Tap to see full-sized Samsung Galaxy M20 photo samples   Low-light performance was way below par. Very few of our shots came out looking usable, even when taken directly under streetlamps or with plenty of artificial light. There was a lot of motion blurring and a massive loss of detail. Video was also just about okay. Recording goes up to 1080p, and there's no stabilisation which is perhaps understandable at this price level. We saw quite a bit of focus shifting when recording moving objects. The depth effect in Live Focus mode made shots look quite artificial to us. It also didn't help that face beautification was on by default, and dialled up too high. Beautification was also enabled by default when we switched to the front camera. Speaking of which, selfies were also just about acceptable. Samsung Galaxy M20 in pictures   VerdictUnlike some of its current competitors, Samsung has immense brand power. A lot of people might have chosen other options recently based on specifications and features, so having closed that gap, Samsung stands to regain a lot of the customers it has lost. Buying a Samsung phone doesn't feel like a gamble in the way that it might with less established brands. The Korean giant is capitalising on this in its Galaxy M-series marketing by underscoring its huge service network, spanning 1,650 service centres across over 6,000 talukas all over India. We've reviewed the higher-end variant of the Samsung Galaxy M20, with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, which is priced at Rs. 12,990. At the same price, the Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro (Review) offers similar specifications with the roughly equivalent Qualcomm Snapdragon 636 processor and better battery life. The Realme U1 (Review) and Asus ZenFone Max Pro M2 (Review) both have 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, but more powerful processors and also better battery life in our tests. The race between all these models is pretty tight. It seems that the Galaxy M20 doesn't quite catch up to all of its rivals' advantages, but at least it is very competitive for the first time. We hope this is the beginning of a new era for Samsung. Are Samsung Galaxy M10 and Galaxy M20 better than budget phones from Redmi, Realme, and Asus?
