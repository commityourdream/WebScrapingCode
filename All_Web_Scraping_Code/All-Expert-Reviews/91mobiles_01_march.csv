0,33263,Samsung Galaxy M20 review: M marks the spot,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-m20-review?pid=33263,NA , NA," The Galaxy M20 scores well on almost all aspects, making it an automatic choice for those who're looking for a reliable daily driver  BlackBerry. Motorola. Nokia. If you are a gadget enthusiast you’d know what’s common between these phone brands. During their heydays, each of them were at the top of the smartphone shipments charts, but now they don’t even rank among the top five phone brands, and have in fact sold their businesses (Motorola was acquired by Google, and later, by Lenovo) or licensed their brand names (BlackBerry to Optiemus Infracom, and Nokia to HMD Global) to others. You must be wondering why I’m talking about these brands in this review. Well, that’s because if you have been following the Indian phone market closely, then you must be aware that Samsung had to let its market share slip from its fingers, with the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei (and its sub-brand Honor), and even OPPO and Vivo increasing in popularity. While the Chaebol still sits on the second spot in terms of the number of shipments, in 2019, Samsung is now trying to claw back, before the competition gets the better of it.  While we’ve been hearing about Samsung planning to hit the reset button for quite some time, the debut offering(s) under its new strategy comes in the form of the Samsung Galaxy M10 and Galaxy M20. Replacing its erstwhile budget and mid-tier Galaxy J and On series, the ‘M’ range is squarely aimed at millennials. So has the manufacturer been able to pull it off successfully? While I’ll let the sales numbers be a better judge of that, I’m here to find out what exactly do you get for your Rs 12,990 if you purchase the higher-end smartphone in the new M series, the Samsung Galaxy M20. Well, all those leaks and teasers were unmissable. And I’m glad they proved to be true, as the Galaxy M20 is quite unlike any of the earlier affordable phones from Samsung phones. It was just in November that the brand showcased new screens that conform to the full-screen future, including the Infinity V display, and the same can be found on the latest offering. While Samsung is usually among the first to jump on a new trend, it seems it skipped the notch fad and chose instead to go with the waterdrop-style cut-out phenomenon. What’s even more intriguing is the fact that you can now find this small (read: minimally obtrusive) notch on the phonemaker’s handsets priced lowed than Rs 15k. At the back, the M20 features a polycarbonate back with a glossy finish, lending it a classy appeal.  Long story short, the Galaxy M20 does catch your attention with its small notch and offers a good design, but doesn’t feel as premium as phones with glass backs. On that note, the polycarbonate panel on the handset gathers fingerprints and smudges rather easily, and I’d have loved it if the Korean titan had bundled a silicon case. While my review unit comes in Coral Blue (which looks quite distinct, though I admit I’m biased towards blue), you can also purchase the device in black if you prefer a more sedate look.  Towards the right, you’ll find the power button and volume keys, whereas the left spine is home to an ejectable tray. What’s really interesting is the fact that this tray has dedicated slots for two nano-SIMs and a microSD card. At the bottom, you’ll find the Type-C port sandwiched between a 3.5mm audio socket and a speaker grille. On the rear, you’ll find the dual-camera setup accompanied by an LED flash and an oblong-shaped fingerprint reader. What about that Infinity V display though? Well, with a panel measuring 6.3-inches and a full HD+ resolution, the visuals are crisp. And even though the Galaxy M20 features a TFT panel, the colour reproduction is pretty good, and so are the brightness levels. Harsh sunlight doesn’t pose any issues as far as screen legibility is concerned. The screen is protected by a layer of Asahi’s Dragontrail glass to keep scratches and minor nicks at bay. Sadly however, the content doesn’t seem to be optimised for the handset’s aspect ratio, as YouTube and Netflix videos only go up till the notch, which kind of defeats the purpose of having the tiny cut-out (even though you could tweak this from the settings menu, the problem is that the content will be stretched by default and you won’t get an option to get the video till the notch itself). Another problem that I came across is the poor palm rejection ability of the handset. While scrolling through webpages, the content would automatically zoom in and the same issue was also noticeable while using the camera app.  One of the biggest complaints against Samsung’s affordable phones has been that they lack necessary sensors like ambient light sensor and proximity sensor. Thankfully, that’s not the case with the M20. Not just that, it also comes with face unlock capability, which works quite well though it’s not the fastest I’ve come across. Sadly, it doesn’t work in dim lighting, and doesn’t seem to be very secure either as the phone unlocks even when your eyes are closed or the face is partially covered. What you will like however, is the animation around the waterdrop notch when the smartphone is attempting to recognise your face. Of course, you can always resort to using the good ol’ fingerprint scanner, which works like a charm.  In the imaging department, the Samsung Galaxy M20 ships with a pair of shooters on the rear. The combination is made up of a 13-megapixel f/1.9 shooter, and instead of a secondary depth-sensing unit, the device gets a wide-angle sensor with a resolution of 5MP and an aperture of f/2.2. For selfies, the smartphone comes with an 8MP snapper.  One look at the camera interface, and you would find yourself right at home if you’ve used a Samsung handset before - which isn’t a bad thing. All the options are nicely laid out on the front itself. In the portrait orientation, you’ll find the shutter button bang in the middle at the bottom, sandwiched between the video-recording button and the preview gallery. Above that, you’ll find the settings menu, full-screen view (for changing the aspect ratio), flash toggle, real-time filters, and the toggle for the front camera. Up top, you’ll get the ability to switch to portrait mode (dubbed Live Focus), Beauty, Pro, Panorama, and use stickers among others. One grouse however, remains the fact that the HDR mode is only accessible by going into the settings, though my advice would be to keep it on Auto instead of fiddling with it every time.   Quality-wise, you’ll like pictures clicked by Samsung’s Galaxy M20. The colours are pleasing to the eyes (though they aren’t oversaturated, which is slightly odd as the Korean behemoth is known for that) and details are spot on as well, be it in the landscapes or close-up shots. The HDR mode is quite effective too, and offers better contrast in comparison to regular shots. Sadly, low-light pics are riddled with exposure issues and there is a noticeable amount of grain when zoomed in. Shutter speeds and focusing are quick, but autofocusing doesn’t work in the wide-angle mode. Speaking of which, I have been a big proponent of phones that utilise a wide-angle secondary shooter… for the simple reason that they offer a lot of versatility. With the M20 as well, you can get a wider frame without changing your position, though due to the 5-megapixel resolution, you’ll need to compromise on sharpness levels. There’s also the infamous fish-eye effect (the corners / edges look warped), which is more discernible if you are shooting on close quarters. However, I won’t recommend clicking wide-angle pictures in poorly-lit conditions as the results are barely usable. Take a dekko at the normal and wide-angle shots. Of course, you don’t need to use wide-angle mode all the time. So here’s a look at the camera samples shot using the primary shooter and selfie snapper of the Galaxy M20. Gone are the days when affordable smartphones offered low-res shooters on the front for selfies and video calling. These days, you can even find 25-megapixel cameras on the fascia of phones! While the selfie shooter on the M20 doesn’t flaunt such a high resolution, its 8MP snapper should serve your purposes well. Selfies captured by the smartphone offer good details along with accurate colour reproduction. There’s also a software-enabled Live Focus mode, which works fairly well.  Overall, the cameras should work well across conditions, though they aren’t the best in class by any stretch. With regards to videos, the Samsung Galaxy M20 maxes out at 1080p at 30fps. Even though the device lacks optical stabilisation, the footage is pretty good. That said, I’d have certainly liked to see 4k video recording capability, especially considering that the processor powering the smartphone is capable of that, which brings us to… The Galaxy M20 is the brand’s first handset to come powered by Samsung’s Exynos 7904 chipset. The new 14nm SoC has been built from the ground up for emerging markets, and comprises two ‘big’ Cortex-A73 cores running at 1.8GHz, and six ‘LITTLE’ Cortex-A53 cores tuned at 1.6GHz. Considering it’s a new chip, I decided to put it through a series of benchmarks to see where it stacks up in the pecking order in the sub-Rs 15k category. The segment is without a doubt, quite competitive as along with the dedicated silicon companies like MediaTek and Qualcomm, there are Huawei’s Kirin processors as well. Considering benchmarks is just one part of the equation and aren’t necessarily a reflection of the real-life usage, how is it like to use the Samsung Galaxy M20 as a daily driver? In sum, it’s a smooth experience. In my week-long stint with the handset, there was nary an instance of lag on the phone. Multitasking is flawless too, thanks to the 4-gigs of RAM (there’s a 3GB RAM variant as well). Upon boot, there’s around 1.6GB RAM available, and even with multiple apps open, the phone is able to hold its own. Unfortunately, all this doesn’t translate to a good gaming experience. There were choppy frames while playing PUBG, and occasional stutters also ruined the playability even in the lowest settings. The good thing however, is that the M20 keeps its thermals in check and just gets slightly warm even after playing for 30 minutes.  A lot of this stutter-free experience could be attributed to Samsung Experience UI 9.5, which is unlike previous custom skins from the company. There’s barely any bloatware, with just a bunch of Microsoft apps, a couple of apps from Samsung, along with DailyHunt pre-installed, out of which the latter can be uninstalled. Among the first-party apps, the Samsung Max would be of particular interest to those who want to conserve their data usage beyond a certain limit, while Samsung Mall lets you browse for objects online by simply pointing your camera at them (available via the camera app as well). While I wouldn’t say that the interface is as smooth as stock Android, it’s quite close. Along with that, you also get the usual gestures such as those that let you access the app menu with a simple swipe up or down gestures. One thing that will definitely catch your attention on the Galaxy M20 is its lock-screen wallpapers, which keep changing each time you press the power button. Not just that, these aren’t just random images, and are based on what’s going on in the news at that time. You can in fact, click on the info button to read more and if it seems distracting, then you can hit the settings menu to configure the lock screen stories settings. Not only can you disable this feature, you can also choose from 19 categories to only show stories (and relevant wallpapers) from specific topics of interest. My only gripe is the fact the company has opted for Android Oreo as the base, and the promised roll out (August) for 9.0 Pie is quite far away.   As mentioned above, the M20 is a dual-SIM smartphone. Other connectivity options onboard include Wi-Fi (sadly, there’s no ac support), Bluetooth with LDAC support, and GPS. A good speaker is paramount to enjoying multimedia on the go, especially considering the large screen that’s available at your disposal with the Samsung Galaxy M20. And while the one on the device won’t blow you away, it does a good job of offering loud and clear output. Perhaps the biggest USP of the Galaxy M20 is its battery prowess, even more than its Infinity V panel. That’s because Samsung has packed in a capacious 5,000mAh cell inside its latest offering, which ensures that the handset can stay away from the charger for long. To put it simply, you could choose to go to a two-day trip and safely leave the power adapter at home. Charged fully at 7am in the morning, the phone was able to continue till the morning the day after, which is nothing short of impressive, especially considering the fact that I’m a power user and was on 4G / Wi-Fi the entire time, used GPS for navigation, streamed music / videos via Bluetooth and even played a few games during that time. I got an average screen-on time of more than five hours, which is yet another solid indication of the phone’s battery prowess.   It’s also appreciable that the M20 comes with fast charge capabilities and can be juiced up with a 15W adapter. With the bundled charger, the handset goes from 10 to 100 in about two hours, which is quite good considering the battery rating. While reviewing the Galaxy M20, two thoughts were going through my mind: a) Samsung is aiming to offer an all-round package with this phone, and it seems to have done that successfully b) The device isn’t just a sign of Samsung taking its competition seriously, but also the fact that it’s listening to its consumers. From the waterdrop screen to the USB Type-C port, and from offering all the necessary sensors to opting for a beefy 5,000mAh battery – all of this are examples of the same And when you put these two things together with the attractive starting price of Rs 10,999 (Rs 12,999 for the higher-end, 4GB RAM model that I’ve reviewed), Samsung may very well have a winner on its hands. That’s not to say that the device doesn’t face any competition – quite the opposite actually. As is evident from the processor benchmark comparison, the handset is up against a flurry of devices – including the ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M2 (review), Realme U1 (review), Xiaomi Redmi Note 6 Pro (review), and Honor 10 Lite (review). Each of these devices are better in some aspect or the other (if not all) when compared to the Galaxy M20, making it really hard to choose one.  Yet, none of these rivals can match up to the brand equity of Samsung (though Xiaomi comes quite close, especially as far as netizens are concerned). On its own, the M20 scores well on almost all aspects, right from the gorgeous display, good cameras, and powerful internals, to the long-lasting battery. And if you round that off with an affordable price, the Samsung Galaxy M20 becomes an automatic choice for those who’re looking for a reliable daily driver.

1,33473,Nokia 5.1 Plus review: the budget smartphone gets a chic makeover,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nokia-5-1-plus-review?pid=33473,NA , NA," We’ve become accustomed to smartphones in the Rs 10,000 – Rs 15,000 range offering ample horsepower, capable cameras and capacious batteries. There are two areas where budget smartphones lack however – design and software. Nokia wants to change this. The company has launched a slew of Android One smartphones of late, offering a stock interface and guaranteed timely Android updates. And while the brand has continued to offer its trademark build quality on all its devices since its rebirth under HMD Global, it’s gone a step further with its recent spate of launches. The Nokia 5.1 Plus is one such device, and boasts a design and materials that are borrowed from its more expensive siblings, the Nokia 6.1 Plus (review) and the Nokia 7.1 Plus. The 5.1 Plus has a clear advantage over the competition on this front, but how does it fare in other aspects? Here’s what I found.  The Nokia 5.1 Plus looks a flagship. I’m not kidding – the phone felt equally if not more premium than my iPhone 8. Like the Nokia 6.1 Plus, it features a glass sandwich design with a shiny polycarbonate frame. The phone feels really solid in the hand, and although the use of glass makes it slippery (you’d definitely want to slap a case on), it’s still got that sturdiness you’d expect from a Nokia device. The Nokia 5.1 Plus borrows the fullscreen 19:9 display with the notch from the 6.1 Plus, along with thin bezels on the side and a narrow chin at the bottom. The high screen-to-body ratio means that even with the 5.8-inch display, the phone can be easily used with one hand, and I say that as someone with small hands.  The device features a USB Type-C port, which you won’t find on most phones in this price band, and thankfully it also retains the 3.5mm jack. The display features HD+ resolution, and while icons and text look sharp, I found that colours looked a bit washed out, especially while playing videos. The Nokia 5.1 Plus also offers an Ambient Display feature, which blacks out the screen and shows you the time, date and notifications when you pick up the device.   The rear camera on the Nokia 5.1 Plus is a 13MP f/2.0 PDAF unit assisted by a 5MP depth sensor to allow bokeh shots. At the front, there’s an 8MP selfie camera with f/2.2 aperture.  The rear camera can manage decent daylight images, but struggles with focus. I found many photos out of focus even in bright daylight, with the tiniest movement resulting in motion blur. While colours were true to life, images lacked the detail and clarity that you’d find from other cameras in this price range, such as the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 (review). The bokeh mode features an adjustable slider to change depth and works well enough, although I did notice visible softening around the edges. The front camera can take decent selfies provided the lighting is good. It also offers a bokeh mode, but this is software generated so you can’t adjust the level of depth.  As mentioned earlier, the Nokia 5.1 Plus is an Android One handset, and therefore runs a stock version of Android 8.1 Oreo. Thanks to the Android One program, you can expect security updates for three years and Android updates for two years. Nokia has an excellent track record when it comes to pushing updates to its devices, so you can expect the same on the 5.1 Plus. Powering the handset is an octa-core MediaTek Helio P60 chipset, paired with 3GB of RAM. You get 32GB of onboard storage, out of which about 22GB is available to use. You can expand the storage using the microSD card slot, but you’d have to sacrifice a SIM card slot in the process. In my usage, I found the phone to be more than capable of multi-tasking with everyday tasks like browsing, watching videos and using social media apps like Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and WhatsApp. Asphalt 9: Legends plays fine on default graphics settings, and the phone remained cool to the touch after a 20-30 minute gaming session. That said, the Nokia 5.1 isn’t buttery smooth. There’s a short lag (a second or so) when loading the camera app for the first time, and delays between pressing the shutter and the photo being processed. Opening apps and unlocking the phone also took slightly longer than I would have liked – again I’m talking seconds here, but it’s noticeable.  The battery on the Nokia 5.1 Plus is the same as that on the 6.1 Plus – a 3,060mAh unit. The battery easily lasted me an entire day, with over five hours of screen time. If you’re a power user though, you might find yourself reaching for the charger by the evening. In our battery drain test, the Nokia 5.1 Plus lasted for close to 12 hours, while recharging it with the bundled charger took about 2 hours.   When 91mobiles reviewed the Nokia 6.1 Plus, we praised the device for its design and vanilla software, but felt it lost out to the competition from Xiaomi and ASUS. With the Nokia 5.1 Plus, I’m leaning towards the same opinion. Nokia has really nailed the design of the 5.1 Plus – at Rs 10,990 you won’t find any smartphone which comes close to offering the same build quality. I also like the fact that Nokia has opted for USB Type-C on the device, and kept the software completely devoid of bloatware. But there are areas where the Nokia 5.1 Plus falters – the cameras for instance are not on par with the competition, and the performance and battery life can’t match up to the likes of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 and ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1. That said, with the 5.1 Plus, it feels like Nokia has finally cracked the code for budget phones, and I’m keen to see future offerings from the brand in this segment.",By Ketaki Bhojnagarwala -,"October 4, 2018", NA
2,33285,Realme U1 review: a shark in the mid-range,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/realme-u1-review?pid=33285,NA , NA," Over the last few months, OPPO’s subsidiary smartphone brand Realme has quickly established itself as a formidable rival to Xiaomi in India. The company’s first phone – the Realme 1 (review), was a notable competitor to the Redmi Note 5 Pro (review), while the affordable C1 (review) took on the likes of the Redmi 6A (review). Realme, which has since distanced itself from OPPO to become a standalone brand, has now launched the U1, a selfie-focussed offering in the mid-range. I’ve been testing Realme U1 for the last week, and here’s what you need to know. The Realme U1 is among the most stylish smartphones you’ll currently find in this price band. You might be fooled into thinking the back panel is glass (I was), but it’s actually made of a transparent acrylic composite, which Realme says is more durable and scratch-resistant. My review unit was black, but you can also get the phone in blue and gold colour options. The back panel features a ‘light pillar’ effect that creates vertical patterns when held up against a light source. This, coupled with the waterdrop notch on the display, makes the Realme U1 quite the stunner. It even makes the recently-launched Redmi Note 6 Pro (review) look clunky in comparison. The Realme U1 features rounded edges, which make it comfortable to hold despite the slab-like form factor. At the rear, you’ll find the dual primary cameras and LED flash in a horizontal setup, with a fingerprint sensor below. The Realme U1 features a 6.3-inch display with full HD+ resolution. The display is sharp with good viewing angles and punchy colours, but visibility falters under sunlight. With an aspect ratio of 19:5:9, and the absence of bezels barring a slim chin at the bottom, the U1’s screen delivers an immersive viewing experience. A layer of Gorilla Glass 3 protects the screen, and Realme has also installed a screen protector out of the box. Another goodie you’ll find in the box is a clear case. The case is of good quality, but has an annoying flap over the micro-USB port that gets in the way when you want to quickly plug in the charger. The Realme U1 is a selfie-focussed smartphone, and to that end, is fitted with a 25MP front camera with f/2.0 aperture. There’s no front-facing LED, but you do get a screen flash for illumination. The front camera can also create a software-generated depth effect. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of photos from the selfie camera, which turned out well even in low light or when there was harsh backlighting. Images are clear with natural skin tones, and while I disabled the AI beauty mode, you can enable it if you prefer. The depth effect doesn’t over-blur the background either, so images look realistic. The rear cameras come in a 13MP+2MP configuration, with the latter being a depth sensor. Unlike the front camera, the rear camera offers a dedicated Portrait mode, with several iPhone-inspired studio lighting options like Natural, Film, Mono, etc. The Portrait mode works well, both for humans as well as objects, and like the front camera, doesn’t artificially blur the background. Daylight shots turned out vibrant and detailed, although I did notice that some images look over-sharpened and over-saturated. Low light shots are grainy, but usable nonetheless. My only qualm with the rear cameras were that they struggle with locking focus for macro shots, particularly if the background is busy. Take a look at some image samples below. Even though Realme has positioned itself as an independent brand, it still borrows its software from OPPO. As a result, the Realme U1 runs ColorOS 5.2 atop Android 8.1 Oreo. If you’ve used an OPPO phone in the past, you’ll be familiar with the interface, which has tons of added features. Many of these are useful and let you fine-tune settings to your liking, but some are redundant. For example, the Smart Assistant that is displayed on the left of the homescreen is basically OPPO’s version of Google Assistant. ColorOS also comes with a ton of bloatware – I counted eight third-party apps. Thankfully, these can be uninstalled. Powering the Realme U1 is an octa-core MediaTek Helio P70 chipset clocked at 2.1GHz. My unit came with 4GB RAM and 64GB storage (48GB out of the box), but there’s also a lower-specced variant with 3GB RAM and 32GB storage. The storage is expandable up to 256GB via a dedicated microSD card slot, which is always a welcome feature. While I didn’t notice any glaring issues with day-to-day performance, navigating the interface, multi-tasking and opening apps seemed sluggish. The heavy nature of ColorOS is more likely to blame for this than the processor though. Gaming is a breeze on the device, with graphics-heavy titles like Asphalt 8 running smoothly with no frame drops. The phone heats up during extended gaming sessions, but doesn’t get uncomfortably hot. The Realme U1 offers both a fingerprint sensor and face unlock for security. The fingerprint sensor is fast and accurate, and was my preferred unlock method. The face unlock feature is also fast, but requires you to swipe up on the lockscreen to unlock the phone, which is an extra step. Since the U1 lacks an infrared sensor, face unlock doesn’t work in the dark, so I’d advise setting up the fingerprint sensor alongside as well. The battery on the Realme U1 is one of its best features. The 3,500mAh pack is capable of lasting more than a day with heavy use, even with hotspot enabled for a couple of hours. In our battery drain test, the device performed admirably, clocking 16 hours before running out of juice. Recharging the phone with the included charger took 2.5 hours. The Realme U1 is one of the most well-rounded smartphones you can buy at its asking price. It ticks most boxes for me, and doesn’t have any serious downsides, barring ColorOS, which I’m not a fan of. Predictably, Realme is positioning the U1 as a competitor to Xiaomi’s Redmi Y2 (review). Other notable rivals include the Honor 8C (first impressions), ASUS ZenFone Max Pro M1 (review) and Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro (review). While you might opt for a different phone based purely on brand preference, if it’s a good selfie camera you’re after, the Realme U1 is your best bet.",By Ketaki Bhojnagarwala -,"November 28, 2018",Expert Rating4/5
3,33065,Nokia 7.1 first impressions: brings an HDR display to the masses,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nokia-7-1-first-impressions?pid=33065,NA , NA," “The Nokia 7.1 stands out as the first phone in the affordable segment to boast an HDR display” Brand Nokia, under the aegis of HMD Global, is churning out smartphone after smartphone, and in the process, giving a much-needed fillip to Google’s Android One platform. Not that we’re complaining. The latest from the company comes in the form of the Nokia 7.1, which is basically a successor to the Nokia 7 that launched in China a year ago. Slotted between the Nokia 6.1 Plus (review) and the 7 Plus (review), the new Nokia 7.1 actually shares quite a few specs with the former, but boasts a few interesting new features. And the HDR10-capable display is right on the top of that list. Before we get ahead of ourselves though, let’s take a closer look. Nokia phones are renowned for their build quality, and the 7.1 takes that up several notches. The glass sandwich design with a series 6000 aluminium frame makes it feel very solid in the hand, but its accentuated details and diamond-cut chamfers lend a really premium feel. No two ways about it – the device feels flagship-grade as far as the build quality and design are concerned, and while the Gloss Blue shade (which is so dark that it almost looks black) is subtle, it’s the Gloss Steel variant that stands out with its copper accents. Thanks to the 5.84-inch display that bears an aspect ratio of 19:9 and a notch on top, the overall size of the phone is quite compact. There’s a small chin below the screen which bears Nokia branding, but otherwise the bezels are quite slim. The left spine is home to the hybrid SIM slot, while the right is where you’ll find the accentuated volume rocker and power key. At the rear, you’ll see the vertically-aligned dual snappers, placed in the centre. Below the camera module sits the circular fingerprint scanner. You’ll also find Nokia and Android One branding here. The 3.5mm headset socket is on top, while the USB Type-C port and the speaker are placed at the bottom. The Nokia 7.1 marks the debut of the brand’s new PureDisplay screen tech. As per Nokia, the key reason behind introducing this tech is the fact that over two thirds of videos are viewed on the mobile, and it wants to make sure its users can get the best experience. The FHD+ screen on the device supports HDR10 and while we’ve seen this on premium flagships from the likes of Apple, Samsung, LG and Sony, it’s the first time an HDR-capable screen will be available in the affordable smartphone segment. HDR videos is still hard to come by, but you can find content on Netflix and Amazon Prime. HDR support promises a very immersive experience while viewing supported videos, thanks to higher contrast and better dynamic range. In fact, Nokia’s PureDisplay tech even upscales non-HDR content in real time, which means that even SDR videos should show better dynamic range. While we couldn’t test it out during our brief time with the Nokia 7.1, the promise is certainly an enticing one, especially considering that the new smartphone should fall in the lower mid-range segment. For photography, you get dual 12MP+5MP cameras with ZEISS optics, along with an 8MP snapper at front for selfies. The cameras allow for bokeh photography, and the custom Nokia camera app offers a ton of features, including a powerful Pro mode for granular control. The other available features include EIS for video shooting, 360-degree Nokia spatial audio and the signature Bothie mode that uses both the front and rear cameras to shoot split-screen videos and live stream to platforms like Facebook and YouTube. The Bothie mode has received an update that lets you drag the vertical divider to let you control how much you want to show via the front or the rear cameras, and even freeze one side of the frame if you want. Software-wise, things remain pretty standard. The Android One platform on the Nokia 7.1 comes in the form of stock Android Oreo, with a promised upgrade to Pie by November. Inside sits Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 636 processor, which, frankly speaking, doesn’t seem like much of an upgrade, especially as compared to the Nokia 6.1 Plus that has the same SoC. However, going by our brief experience with the phone, the 7.1 seems snappy enough, and we didn’t face any stutter or lag. A 3,060mAh battery with fast charging support powers the show. The starting price of the Nokia 7.1 has been pegged at €299 euros. This is for the 3/32 variant, though a 4/64 model should also be in the offing. The pricing does seem pretty high, but we’re hoping that HMD Global would be able to price it much more aggressively when the device lands in India. No timeframe for that yet, so we’ll wait and see how things play out, and how much of a differentiator that HDR-capable display turns out to be. We’re quite eager to run the Nokia 7.1 through our review grind and see if it can deliver in terms of imaging prowess and as a daily driver…",By Deepak Dhingra -,"October 4, 2018", NA
4,33525,Nokia 6.1 Plus review: a looker that gets some things right,https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nokia-6-1-plus-review?pid=33525,NA , NA," “Here’s our comprehensive review of Nokia’s latest midranger – the Nokia 6.1 Plus” It’s been two years since Nokia got back into the reckoning and in that time, the company has launched numerous Android smartphones with compelling specs and features. It goes without saying that the company’s factories are working at full capacity, as the brand recently unveiled yet another smartphone to compete in the budget segment. Dubbed the Nokia 6.1 Plus, the smartphone was initially launched in China as the Nokia X6 and it is the first device from the company’s stables to ship with a display notch.  Moreover, you’ll also get the usual array of a glass-back design, the latest Android software and dual-cameras with the smartphone. But, is that enough to fend off the competition from the likes of Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 5 Pro (review) and ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1 (review)? Stay with me to find out.   They say looks are subjective, but you’ll be hard-pressed to find someone who doesn’t fancy the design of the Nokia 6.1 Plus. Unlike its predecessors which employed metal in their construction, the Nokia 6.1 Plus ships with glass on both the front as well as the back, held together by a metal trim. Although it’s not uncommon to find glass-back designs in the affordable segment anymore, the build quality on the Nokia 6.1 Plus is impeccable and it blows the competition out of the water. The 2.5D curved glass merges seamlessly into the smartphone’s frame, the chamfered metal trim feels exquisite to the touch and despite the glass surface encompassing almost 93 percent of the handset’s entire body, the Nokia 6.1 Plus doesn’t come across as delicate. This kind of confidence can only be instilled in the buyers by Nokia.  Moreover, to ensure that the 6.1 Plus’ design doesn’t feel bland, Nokia has added chrome trims around the handset’s camera module and physical buttons which further enhance the smartphone’s aesthetics. Quite honestly, the Nokia 6.1 Plus looks and feels a lot like Apple’s high-end iPhone X, which says a lot about the smartphone’s excellent design. What’s more, similar to Apple’s offering, the Nokia 6.1 Plus feels extremely compact in the hand, despite its massive 5.8-inch display. This is in a large part due to the smartphone’s sleek bezels, which make it so that the display takes up over 81 percent of the smartphone’s frame.  Unfortunately, as is the case with most glass-back devices, the Nokia 6.1 Plus smudges really easily and is quite slippery too. I got the black colour variant of the smartphone to review and it is a nightmare to keep fingerprints from sticking to the back of the device. Moreover, don’t let the presence of a layer of Corning’s Gorilla Glass V3 on the smartphone fool you – it still picks up scratches and dings like any other glass-back device out there. Therefore, you’d be better off slapping a case on the smartphone if you want to keep the smartphone in a pristine condition.  I would also like to point out that the fingerprint sensor on the smartphone has been positioned a bit too low for my liking. The sensor sits below the smartphone’s dual-camera setup and its placement takes a while to get used to. In fact, I spent the first few days tapping at the smartphone’s camera module and wondering why isn’t the device getting unlocked. But, once you get used to the sensor’s placement, you’ll find that it works quite well – fingerprints are registered in the blink of an eye and you’ll be inside your home screen in under a second. Also, the Nokia 6.1 Plus ships with a headphone socket, which is being omitted from select affordable smartphones nowadays.  As I mentioned previously, the Nokia 6.1 Plus ships with a 5.8-inch display with a cutout at the centre to make room for the secondary camera and the earpiece. Now, I do not advocate the use of a notch unless it’s absolutely needed, as was the case with the iPhone X. However, the notch on the Nokia 6.1 Plus is considerably smaller than what you would get with other devices. Moreover, if you dislike the notch all that much, then you can disable it from within the settings. I feel that Nokia is pandering to both, the notch lovers and haters alike, which is a smart move to sell more phones.     As far as the display is concerned, the panel makes use of IPS LCD technology and bears FHD+ resolution. Unsurprisingly, the text feels razor sharp on the smartphone’s display and the colours, though not as vibrant as exhibited by an AMOLED panel, feel tasteful to the eyes too. The viewing angles are really good, so you’ll need to be wary of hiding sensitive information whilst commuting in a metro from nosy people. Unfortunately, the display doesn’t get too bright so you might have to squint your eyes under direct sunlight to see the content being displayed. If I could end my review here, I would’ve given the smartphone a big ol’ thumbs up. But, there are some other things you should know before pulling the trigger on your purchase. Take it from someone who reviews smartphone on a day-to-day basis – you can get a really good smartphone with capable cameras by spending just south of Rs 20K. Be it the Xiaomi Mi A2 or the recently unveiled POCO F1, there are options galore for aspiring photographers to get a good smartphone with decent cameras without burning a hole in their wallets. Can then, the Nokia 6.1 Plus join the ranks of the elites I mentioned previously? Well, before I answer that, let’s talk about the smartphone’s camera specs.  The Nokia 6.1 Plus comes equipped with a pair of 16MP and 5MP shooters at the back with f/2.0 and f/2.4 apertures respectively. For selfies, you’ll be smiling into a 16MP shooter, with f/2.4 aperture. Coming to the performance of the rear cameras, the Nokia 6.1 Plus will often test your patience as its primary shooters take a while to latch on to the subject. However, your patience will be rewarded fruitfully once the smartphone does get the subject in focus, provided you’re shooting under ideal lighting scenarios. By that, I mean that you’ll want to be outdoors on a bright sunny day with the sun behind you, casting natural light on to your subject. The shots I took with the smartphone during daytime were brilliant – the macros had plenty of details, the landscapes looked straight out of a movie and the colours felt natural. The smartphone’s built-in HDR mode did its job well too and boosted the colours and the details in the highlights and the shadows to make a scene feel more pleasing to the eyes. That said, the smartphone’s rear cameras struggle to process the colour ‘red’, which is evident when you try to click close-ups of flowers. Shots taken in portrait mode looked nice, however, the blur effect along the borders of the subject wasn’t as consistent as I’d liked it to be. Unsurprisingly, the cameras struggle to lock down on the subject at night, and even when they do, the quality of the image will rarely ever meet your expectations.   As for selfies, I managed to click some good-looking self-portraits with ample details in a well-lit environment. Moreover, if you’re not a fan of the pseudo beautification done by most Chinese smartphones, then you’ll love the natural-looking selfies from the Nokia 6.1 Plus. Unfortunately, since the smartphone doesn’t ship with a dedicated LED flash module for the front camera, the quality of selfies taken at night takes a minor dip.  For its asking price, the Nokia 6.1 Plus will go head-to-head with Xiaomi’s recently launched Mi A2 (review). Now, from a performance standpoint, the Mi A2 packs in more powerful hardware but, having used both the smartphones intensively, I can confidently say that the Nokia 6.1 Plus is no slouch when it comes to tackling everyday tasks.  Underneath its glass-chassis, the Nokia 6.1 Plus is driven by an octa-core Snapdragon 636 processor which works alongside 4GB of RAM and 64GB of built-in storage. However, unlike the Mi A2, the Nokia 6.1 Plus does offer you the choice between using two SIMs or expanding the built-in memory up to 400GB by popping in a microSD card.  In terms of performance, the Nokia 6.1 Plus managed to keep pace with my intensive usage comfortably. Navigating through the system UI was a breeze, multitasking was as smooth as butter and despite having a dozen apps open in the background, the smartphone didn’t slow down to catch its breath. That said, if you’re an avid gamer, then you will find faults with the smartphone’s processor. As an example, PUBG automatically defaults the graphics settings to low, which drops the draw distance, making it difficult to spot enemies from afar. On the other hand, buyers investing in the similarly-priced Xiaomi Mi A2 will be able to enjoy the title at medium graphics settings comfortably. Similarly, other demanding titles like Asphalt 9 and Unkilled were a bit choppy too when I was playing them with the graphics setting set to max.    On the flip side, the software onboard the Nokia 6.1 Plus is a joy to use. The smartphone runs Android Oreo from the get go, but since it is an Android One device, you will get the latest Android Pie update down the line for sure. Now, I have a slight bias towards smartphones which ship with stock Android which made using the Nokia 6.1 Plus that more fun for me. I didn’t have to worry about unnecessary bloatware eating up my device’s storage and there were no irrelevant notifications clogging up my status bar, asking me to sign in to a third-party app store or account. All in all, the software on the Nokia 6.1 Plus is clean and functional – what more could anyone ask for?    Nokia phones have for long been hailed for their incredible battery life which could last users for days on end. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the Nokia 6.1 Plus’ 3,060mAh battery, which required me to plug in the smartphone twice a day. To give you some perspective, I managed to get around four hours of screen on time with the device, with my usage including playing some casual games, browsing through my social media feeds, messaging and listening to music. Moreover, you should know that the smartphone lasted 11 hours on our 91mobiles battery test, which is average at best. The Nokia 6.1 Plus certainly has a lot going for it. For its asking price of Rs 16,999, the handset features a beautiful design, is a decent performer, comes with expandable storage and features a capable selfie-camera. However, in the cut-throat smartphone industry, there are a plethora of other options which could give you more bang for your buck. The Xiaomi Mi A2 comes instantly to mind, which offers better performance and superior cameras as compared to Nokia’s offering.  Moreover, you could even opt for the Xiaomi Redmi Note 5 Pro or the ASUS Zenfone Max Pro M1, both of which offer the same core specs as the Nokia 6.1 Plus, albeit are priced slightly lower. Lastly, if you can stretch your budget a bit, then you could get your hands on the much more powerful POCO F1 (review) or the Honor Play (review) too.  Consequently, while the Nokia 6.1 Plus is a good smartphone, it’s overshadowed by better offerings from the competition. And round and round we go.   ",By Prateek Pandey -,"September 3, 2018",Expert Rating3.5/5
