The brilliant 5-lens camera setup alone gives me enough reasons to recommend this phone to anyone who keeps photography in his/her highest regards. Besides, the vibrant QHD+ OLED screen, super durable design and best-in-class audio setup are some more reasons to invest in this device. However, you just cannot ignore the competition.",By Rohit Arora,"Updated: Tuesday, February 26, 2019, 11:02 [IST]"

As the company plans to lock horns with the Chinese compatitors, it needs to have a powerful, feature-rich device in the segment, and the Galaxy M20 checks almost all the boxes. It comes with a brilliant display, a long-lasting battery life, and a sturdy build. Starting at Rs 10,990, it is Samsung's most aggressively priced device till date.",By Vishal Kawadkar,"Updated: Wednesday, February 6, 2019, 12:32 [IST]"

3,"Honor View 20 Review: Innovative and feature-packed, but does it also deliver?",https://www.gizbot.com/mobile/reviews/honor-view-20-review-057307.html,PROS  Immersive Video playback experienceCamera clicks pictures with great detailsSuper slow-motion is an added bonus3D TOF sensor comes useful in many real-world applicationsSnappy software and lag-free gaming experienceGood battery life,"CONS  Slippery, fingerprint magnet and not a perfect fit for one hand useCamera software could use a lot of improvementsNo water-dust resistivityNo Wireless charging IPS LCD Screen is not as good as an AMOLED panelNot a good buy for Stock Android fans","With many industries first, Honor View 20 comes across as the most feature-packed flagship smartphone in its respective price-point. It is also the best smartphone ever came out from the house of Honor. The punch hole display is innovative and makes View 20 a great mobile device for gaming and video streaming. Another major highlight of Honor View 20 is its crazy 48MP rear camera aided with a 3D TOF sensor. Sadly, the 48MP sensor doesn't quite live up to the hype of being the first ever massive sensor on a smartphone. Still, View 20 offers the best overall camera performance in sub 40k price segment. The software performance of the handset can be a deal-breaker for users who are fond of clean stock Android UI. As far as battery life, processing speed, multitasking, connectivity, and gaming are concerned, the View 20 is no less than Huawei Mate 20 Pro, Samsung's top-end Galaxy Series and every other high-end flagship handset available in the market. Overall, Honor View 20 is for consumers who are always ready to test the new technology and don't want to compromise on the features. When compared to its closest rival- OnePlus 6T, View 20 is just slightly better because it offers a more feature-packed camera, better battery life, and microSD card support. OnePlus 6T is a clear winner in the software department and even in the display performance to some extent as the AMOLED panel offers a better user experience than View 20's LCD screen in terms of color reproduction and viewing angles.",By Rohit Arora, 
4,Asus ZenFone Max M2 Review: Good battery life and stock Android but underwhelming cameras,https://www.gizbot.com/mobile/reviews/asus-zenfone-max-m2-review-good-battery-life-and-stock-android-056892.html,PROS  Robust buildDecent hardwareStock AndroidGood Battery Back up,CONS  Average CameraDisplay Maxes out at 720 pixels,"The ZenFone Max M2 is a good entry-segment smartphone which not only carries a reasonable price tag but also offers some decent specifications. The device carries a price tag of Rs 9,999 for the 3GB RAM with 32GB storage variant and Rs 11,999 for the 4GB RAM and 64GB storage variant. At this price point, the device competes with Xiaomi Redmi 6 Pro, Honor 9N, Realme 2 and others. The device is a perfect deal if you are looking for stock Android, good design and a long-lasting battery backup.",By Sandeep Sarkar,"Updated: Friday, January 18, 2019, 10:16 [IST]"
